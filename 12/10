We investigate the stability and dynamics of accretion shocks in CTTSs,\nconsidering the case of beta >= 1 in the post-shock region.

We model an accretion stream propagating through the atmosphere of a\nCTTS and impacting onto its chromosphere, by performing 2D axisymmetric MHD\nsimulations. The model takes into account the stellar magnetic field, the\ngravity, the radiative cooling, and the thermal conduction (including the\neffects of heat flux saturation).\n  RESULTS. The dynamics and stability of the accretion shock strongly depends\non the plasma beta. In the case of shocks with beta > 10, violent outflows of\nshock-heated material (and possibly MHD waves) are generated at the base of the\naccretion column and strongly perturb the surrounding stellar atmosphere and\nthe accretion column itself (modifying, therefore, the dynamics of the shock).\nIn shocks with beta ~ 1, the post-shock region is efficiently confined by the\nmagnetic field. The shock oscillations induced by cooling instability are\nstrongly influenced by beta: for beta > 10, the oscillations may be rapidly\ndumped by the magnetic field, approaching a quasi-stationary state, or may be\nchaotic with no obvious periodicity due to perturbation of the stream induced\nby the post-shock plasma itself; for beta ~ 1 the oscillations are\nquasi-periodic, although their amplitude is smaller and the frequency higher\nthan those predicted by 1D models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2009 16:52:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

We have compiled from the literature a database of carefully\ndetermined solar neighborhood stellar abundances of seven iron-peak elements,\nTi, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni and then plotted [X/Fe] versus [Fe/H] to study\nthe trends as functions of metallicity. Chemical evolution models were then\nemployed to force a fit to the observed trends by adjusting the input massive\nstar metallicity-sensitive yields of Kobayashi et al. Our results suggest that\nyields of Ti, V, and Co are generally larger as well as anticorrelated with\nmetallicity, in contrast to the Kobayashi et al. predictions. We also find the\nyields of Cr and Mn to be generally smaller and directly correlated with\nmetallicity compared to the theoretical results. Our results for Ni are\nconsistent with theory, although our model suggests that all Ni yields should\nbe scaled up slightly. The outcome of this exercise is the computation of a set\nof integrated yields, i.e., stellar yields weighted by a slightly flattened\ntime-independent Salpeter initial mass function and integrated over stellar\nmass, for each of the above elements at several metallicity points spanned by\nthe broad range of observations. These results are designed to be used as\nempirical constraints on future iron-peak yield predictions by stellar\nevolution modelers. Special attention is paid to the interesting behavior of\n[Cr/Co] with metallicity -- these two elements have opposite slopes -- as well\nas the indirect correlation of [Ti/Fe] with [Fe/H]. These particular trends, as\nwell as those exhibited by the inferred integrated yields of all iron-peak\nelements with metallicity, are discussed in terms of both supernova\nnucleosynthesis and atomic physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2009 17:54:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

In this paper, we study how rule clusters of the pattern Xi - Y are\ndistributed over different interestingness measures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2009 18:11:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-10"}

We find that satellites are older and metal-richer than centrals of the\nsame stellar mass. In addition, the slopes of the age-stellar mass and\nmetallicity-stellar mass relations are found to become shallower in denser\nenvironments. This is due to the fact that the average age and metallicity of\nlow mass satellite galaxies increase with the mass of the halo in which they\nreside. A comparison with the semi-analytical model of Wang et al. (2008) shows\nthat it succesfully reproduces the fact that satellites are older than centrals\nof the same stellar mass and that the age difference increases with the halo\nmass of the satellite. This is a consequence of strangulation, which leaves the\nstellar populations of satellites to evolve passively, while the prolonged star\nformation activity of centrals keeps their average ages younger. The resulting\nage offset is larger in more massive environments because their satellites were\naccreted earlier. The model fails, however, in reproducing the halo mass\ndependence of the metallicities of low mass satellites, yields\nmetallicity-stellar mass and age-stellar mass relations that are too shallow,\nand predicts that satellite galaxies have the same metallicities as centrals of\nthe same stellar mass, in disagreement with the data.

The time evolution follows from\nthe fact that each modelled galaxy approaches a steady state where the SFR\nfollows the (net) cold gas accretion rate. The key feature of the model is a\nhalo mass floor M_{min}~10^{11} below which accretion is quenched in order to\nsimultaneously account for the observed slopes of the SFR-Mass and\nTully-Fischer relations. The same successes cannot be achieved via a\nstar-formation threshold (or delay) nor by varying the SF efficiency or the\nfeedback efficiency. Combined with the mass ceiling for cold accretion due to\nvirial shock heating, the mass floor M_{min} explains galaxy \"downsizing\",\nwhere more massive galaxies formed earlier and over a shorter period of time.\nIt turns out that the model also accounts for the observed galactic baryon and\ngas fractions as a function of mass and time, and the cosmic SFR density from\nz~6 to z=0, which are all resulting from the mass floor M_{min}. The model\nhelps to understand that it is the cosmological decline of accretion rate that\ndrives the decrease of cosmic SFR density between z~2 and z=0 and the rise of\nthe cosmic SFR density allows us to put a constraint on our main parameter\nM_{min}~10^{11} solar masses.

The overall count of\nstealth galaxies is sensitive to the presence (or lack) of a low-mass threshold\nin galaxy formation. These systems have luminosities and stellar velocity\ndispersions that are similar to those of known ultrafaint dwarf galaxies but\nthey have more extended stellar distributions (half light radii greater than\nabout 100 pc) because they inhabit dark subhalos that are slightly less massive\nthan their higher surface brightness counterparts. As a result, the typical\npeak surface brightness is fainter than 30 mag per square arcsec. One\nimplication is that the inferred common mass scale for Milky Way dwarfs may be\nan artifact of selection bias. If there is no sharp threshold in galaxy\nformation at low halo mass, then ultrafaint galaxies like Segue 1 represent the\nhigh-mass, early forming tail of a much larger population of objects that could\nnumber in the hundreds and have typical peak circular velocities of about 8\nkm/s and masses within 300 pc of about 5 million solar masses.

The possible outflow acceleration in the transparent stage,\nwhich lowers thermal radiation efficiency, has been taken into account. In the\nstandard internal shock model for the prompt emission, the fast shells should\nmove with a typical Lorentz factor $\\gtrsim 5 \\Gamma_{\\rm i}$ otherwise the GRB\nefficiency will be in disagreement with the observations, where $\\Gamma_{\\rm\ni}$ is the bulk Lorentz factor of the shocked/emitting region. The photosphere\nradius of these fast shells is small and the thermal radiation is too strong to\nbe effectively outshone by the internal shock emission. This is particularly\nthe case for some extremely bright events having $\\Gamma_{\\rm i} \\sim 10^{3}$,\nlike GRBs 080319B and 080916C. The absence of a distinct thermal component in\nthe spectrum of most GRBs challenges the standard internal shock model and may\nsuggest a non-baryonic (magnetic) outflow component.

Over our typical phase range of 0.2-10 deg, we find our\nphase curves to be adequately described by a linear model, for slopes of\n0.04-0.09 mag/deg with average uncertainty less than 0.02 mag/deg.

In a detailed comparison of surface properties\n(including surge slope, B-R color, and albedo), we find that the Trojans have\nsurface properties similar to the P and C class asteroids prominent in the\nouter main belt, yet they have significantly different surge properties (at a\nconfidence level of 99.90%).

Thus, we find strong support for the\nidea that the Trojans originally formed as icy bodies in the outer Solar\nSystem, were captured into their current orbits during the migration of the gas\ngiant planets, and subsequently lost all their surface ices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2009 23:49:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

In the case of the tidal stream\nGD-1, the problem geometry indicates that available proper motion data, with\nindividual accuracy ~4 mas/yr, should allow estimation of its distance with\nabout 50 percent uncertainty. Proper motions accurate to ~1 mas/yr, which are\nexpected from the forthcoming Pan-STARRS PS-1 survey, will allow estimation of\nits distance to about 10 percent uncertainty. Proper motions from the future\nLSST and Gaia projects will be more accurate still, and will allow the parallax\nfor a stream 30 kpc distant to be measured with ~14 percent uncertainty.\n  We demonstrate the feasibility of the method and show that our uncertainty\nestimates are accurate by computing Galactic parallax using simulated data for\nthe GD-1 stream. We also apply the method to actual data for the GD-1 stream,\npublished by Koposov et al. (2009). With the exception of one datum, the\ndistances estimated using Galactic parallax match photometric estimates with\nless than 1 kpc discrepancy. The scatter in the distances recovered using\nGalactic parallax is very low, suggesting that the proper motion uncertainty\nreported by Koposov et al.

Lamport presented an\nexplicit-time description method using a clock-ticking process (Tick) to\nsimulate the passage of time together with a group of global variables for time\nrequirements. This paper proposes a new explicit-time description method with\nno reliance on global variables. Instead, it uses rendezvous synchronization\nsteps between the Tick process and each system process to simulate time. This\nnew method achieves better modularity and facilitates usage of more complex\ntiming constraints. The two explicit-time description methods are implemented\nin DIVINE, a well-known distributed-memory model checker.

The main\nresults are to prove that these generating functions are in fact specific\nrational functions of a distinguished irrational (algebraic) function of the\ngenerating function parameters. This distinguished function is itself the\ngenerating function for the Catalan numbers (or generalized Catalan numbers,\ndepending on the choice of parameter). It is also a solution of the inviscid\nBurgers equation for certain initial data. The shock formation, or caustic, of\nthe Burgers characteristic solution is directly related to the poles of the\nrational forms of the generating functions.\n  These results in turn provide new information about the asymptotics of\nrecurrence coefficients for orthogonal polynomials with respect to exponential\nweights.

The new Lagrangian function used in\nthe Godunov SPH is more analogous to the real Lagrangian function for\ncontinuum.

It is found\nthat $\\epsilon$ satisfies $\\epsilon \\le\n\\nu^{2\\alpha-1}\\norm{u_*}_\\infty^{2(1-\\alpha)}\n\\norm{(-\\Delta)^{\\alpha/2}u_*}^2$, where $\\alpha<1$ and $u_*=u(x,t_*)$ is the\nvelocity field at $t=t_*$. Given $\\epsilon>0$ in the limit $\\nu\\to0$, this\nimplies that the energy spectrum remains no steeper than $k^{-2}$ in that\nlimit. For the critical $k^{-2}$ scaling, the bound for $\\epsilon$ reduces to\n$\\epsilon\\le\\sqrt{3}k_0\\norm{u_0}_\\infty\\norm{u_0}^2$, where $k_0$ marks the\nlower end of the inertial range and $u_0=u(x,0)$.
