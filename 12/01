The radio\nemission from the system consists of a primary component that is associated\nwith the binary, and a non-thermal source (NE) that has been ascribed to a\nwind-collision region (WCR) between the stellar winds of the binary and that of\na B-type star (Star D) to the NE. NE shows no evidence of variation in 23\nepochs where it is resolved separately from the primary radio component,\ndemonstrating that the variable emission arises in the primary. Since NE is\nnon-variable, the radio flux from the primary can now be well determined for\nthe first time, most especially in observations that do not resolve both the\nprimary and NE components. The variable radio emission from the primary has a\nperiod of 6.7+/-0.3 years which is described by a simple model of a non-thermal\nsource orbiting within the stellar wind envelope of the binary. Such a model\nimplies the presence of a third, unresolved stellar companion (Star C) orbiting\nthe 6.6-day binary with a period of 6.7 years. The variable non-thermal\nemission arises from either a WCR between Star C and the binary system, or\npossibly from Star C directly. The model gives a mass-loss rate of 3.4 x\n10^{-5} solar mass/yr for Cyg OB2 #5, unusually high for an Of supergiant and\ncomparable to that of WR stars, and consistent with an unusually strong He I\n1.083-micron emission line, also redolent of WR stars.

Relatively large biases are present\nfor most CMs when global energy budgets and when the atmospheric, oceanic, and\nland budgets are considered. Apparently, the biases do not result from\ntransient effects, but depend on the imperfect closure of the energy cycle in\nthe fluid components and on inconsistencies over land. Therefore, the planetary\nemission temperature is underestimated. This may explain the CMs' cold bias. In\nthe pre-industrial scenario, CMs agree on the location in the mid-latitudes of\nthe peaks of the meridional atmospheric enthalpy transport, while large\ndiscrepancies exist on the intensity. Disagreements on the location and\nintensity of the oceanic transport peaks are serious. With increased $CO_2$\nconcentration, a small poleward shift of the peak and an increase in the\nintensity of the atmospheric transport of up to 10% are detected in both\nhemispheres. Instead, most CMs feature a decrease in the oceanic transport\nintensity in the northern hemisphere and an equatorward shift of the peak in\nboth hemispheres. The Bjerkens compensation mechanism is active both on\nclimatological and interannual time scales. The peak of the total meridional\ntransport is typically around $35^\\circ$ in both hemispheres and scenarios,\nwhereas disagreements on the intensity are relevant.

We\npresent two efficient mechanisms, one for the case of finite-dimensional\nfeature mappings and one for potentially infinite-dimensional feature mappings\nwith translation-invariant kernels. For the case of translation-invariant\nkernels, the proposed mechanism minimizes regularized empirical risk in a\nrandom Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space whose kernel uniformly approximates the\ndesired kernel with high probability. This technique, borrowed from large-scale\nlearning, allows the mechanism to respond with a finite encoding of the\nclassifier, even when the function class is of infinite VC dimension.\nDifferential privacy is established using a proof technique from algorithmic\nstability. Utility--the mechanism's response function is pointwise\nepsilon-close to non-private SVM with probability 1-delta--is proven by\nappealing to the smoothness of regularized empirical risk minimization with\nrespect to small perturbations to the feature mapping.

The resulting\neffective theory is a one-dimensional N=2 super-mechanics model that exhibits\npeculiar features of one-dimensional supersymmetry, such as the appearance of\nfermion-only super-multiplets. The latter necessitates reducing also the\nfermionic sector of M-theory, which is not normally included in the\ncompactification literature and is thus presented, together with the required\ntechnology, in detail. The one-dimensional effective theory is most elegantly\ndescribed in superspace and therefore, a detailed account of one-dimensional\nflat and curved N=2 superspace is provided. This includes developing the theory\nof fermionic multiplets and the study of cross-couplings between 2a and 2b\nmultiplets. Another important aspect is the inclusion of flux. We study its\nconsistency conditions, its relation to supersymmetry and the way it gives rise\nto a potential in the one-dimensional effective action. It is also explained\nhow the supersymmetry-preserving part of the potential can be obtained from a\nGukov-type superpotential. The main motivation of this compactification\nscenario is rooted in the realm of cosmology. Its virtue is a democratic\ntreatment of spatial dimensions. As opposed to the artificial 3+7 split in most\nstring compactifications, the early universe starts out with all spatial\ndimensions compact and small in our approach. One then seeks for dynamical ways\nin which three dimensions grow large at late times. Possible realisations of\nthis idea are discussed both at the classical and at the quantum level.\nFinally, preliminary work on Calabi-Yau five-fold compactifications of F-theory\nand the resulting two-dimensional string-like actions is presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2009 20:41:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-01"}

The duration of\nthe photon signal is proportional to the gas mass, and is generally rather\nlonger than the merger event. At somewhat larger distances, dissipation\nassociated with realigning the gas orbits to the new spin orientation of the\nblack hole can supplement dissipation of the energy gained from orbital\nadjustment to the mass lost in gravitational radiation; these two heat sources\ncan combine to augment the electromagnetic radiation over longer timescales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2009 18:41:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

The aim of this study is twofold: firstly, we\naim to analyse variability patterns and statistical properties of the optical\npolarization light-curve. We find a strong preferred position angle in optical\npolarization. The preferred position angle can be explained by separating the\njet emission into two components: an optical polarization core and chaotic jet\nemission. The optical polarization core is stable on time scales of years and\ncan be explained as emission from an underlying quiescent jet component. The\nchaotic jet emission sometimes exhibits a circular movement in the Stokes\nplane. We interpret these events as a shock front moving forwards and backwards\nin the jet, swiping through a helical magnetic field. Secondly, we use our data\nto assess different binary black hole models proposed to explain the regularly\nappearing double-peaked bursts in OJ287.

At lower masses, the models\npredict that mergers are less frequent, so that the expected anti-correlation\nbetween age and size is not completely erased. This is in good agreement with\nour data: below 3*10^10 Msun, the effective radius R_e is a factor of ~2 lower\nfor older galaxies.

The main\nresults are: (1) On average satellites within hosts in high density\nenvironments are accreted earlier (Delta z~ 0.1$) compared to their\ncounterparts at low densities. For host masses above 5 times10^13 Msol/h this\ntrend weakens and may reverse for higher host masses; (2) The velocity\ndispersion of satellites in low density environments follows that of the host,\ni.e. no velocity bias is observed for host halos at low densities independent\nof host mass. However, for low mass hosts in high density environments the\nvelocity dispersion of the satellites can be up to ~30% larger than that of the\nhost halo, i.e. the satellites are dynamically hotter than their host halos.\n(3) The anisotropy parameter depends on host mass and environment. Satellites\nof massive hosts show more radially biased velocity distributions. Moreover in\nlow density environments satellites have more radially biased velocities (Delta\nbeta > 0.1) compared to their counterparts in high density environments.

It pervades\ncultural markets, and manifests itself in the adoption of scientific and\ntechnical innovations as well as the spread of social practices. Prior\nempirical work on the diffusion of innovations in spatial regions or social\nnetworks has largely focused on the spread of one particular technology among a\nsubset of all potential adopters. It has also been difficult to determine\nwhether the observed collective behaviour is driven by natural influence\nprocesses, or whether it follows external signals such as media or marketing\ncampaigns. Here, we choose an online context that allows us to study social\ninfluence processes by tracking the popularity of a complete set of\napplications installed by the user population of a social networking site, thus\ncapturing the behaviour of all individuals who can influence each other in this\ncontext. By extending standard fluctuation scaling methods, we analyse the\ncollective behaviour induced by 100 million application installations, and show\nthat two distinct regimes of behaviour emerge in the system. Once applications\ncross a particular threshold of popularity, social influence processes induce\nhighly correlated adoption behaviour among the users, which propels some of the\napplications to extraordinary levels of popularity. Below this threshold, the\ncollective effect of social influence appears to vanish almost entirely in a\nmanner that has not been observed in the offline world. Our results demonstrate\nthat even when external signals are absent, social influence can spontaneously\nassume an on-off nature in a digital environment. It remains to be seen whether\na similar outcome could be observed in the offline world if equivalent\nexperimental conditions could be replicated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2009 00:54:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-14"}

In the present paper we shall settle one\nof the conjectures, prove the second conjecture in some special cases and prove\nseveral results related to the second conjecture. We shall also show that if\nthere is an even Zumkeller number that is not half-Zumkeller it should be\nbigger than 7233498900.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2009 02:08:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-02"}

At least half of this gas is lost\npermanently to the intracluster medium, as the tail extends beyond the tidal\nradius of the galaxy. We also detect a hot (400-550 K) component in the tail\nthat is approximately 1% of the mass. The large H_2 line to IR continuum\nluminosity ratio in the tail indicates that star formation is not a major\nexcitation source and that the gas is possibly shock-heated. This discovery\nconfirms that the galaxy is currently undergoing ram-pressure stripping, as\nalso indicated by its X-ray and Halpha tails found previously. We estimate the\ngalaxy is losing its warm H_2 gas at a rate of ~ 2-3 solar masses per year. The\ntrue mass loss rate is likely higher if we account for cold molecular gas and\natomic gas. We predict that the galaxy will lose most of its gas in a single\npass through the core and place a strong upper limit on the ram-pressure\ntimescale of 1 Gyr. We also study the star-forming properties of the galaxy and\nits tail. We identify most of the previously discovered external Halpha sources\nwithin the tail in our 8 um data but not in our 3.6 um data; IRS spectroscopy\nof the region containing these Halpha sources also reveals aromatic features\ntypically associated with star formation. From the positions of these HII\nregions, it appears that star formation is not occurring throughout the\nmolecular hydrogen tail but only immediately downstream of the galaxy. Some of\nthese HII regions lie outside the tidal radius of the galaxy, indicating that\nram-pressure stripping can be a source of intracluster stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2009 05:39:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 May 2010 21:08:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

A general overview of the abundances measured in\npresolar grains (particularly the recently identified presolar silicates)\ncontained in primitive chondrites is presented. Here we will focus on the most\nprimitive chondrite groups, as typically the highest measured abundances of\npresolar grains occur in primitive chondrites that have experienced little\nthermal metamorphism. Looking at the most aqueously altered chondrite groups,\nwe find a clear pattern of decreasing abundance of presolar silicate grains\nwith increasing level of aqueous alteration. We conclude that the measured\nabundances of presolar grains in altered chondrites are strongly biased by\ntheir peculiar histories. Scales quantifying the intensity of aqueous\nalteration and shock metamorphism in chondrites could correlate with the\ncontent in presolar silicates. To do this it would be required to infer the\ndegree of destruction or homogenization of presolar grains in the matrices of\nprimitive meteorites.

We find good agreement in the properties of the turbulence\nobserved in our simulations compared with the dispersion relation calculated\nfor linear waves with arbitrary orientation of ${\\vec k}$.

For mildly- and ultra-relativistic beams, the instability\nsaturates at field amplitudes a few times larger than the homogeneous magnetic\nfield strength. This result matches our recent studies of nonrelativistically\ndrifting, hot cosmic-ray particles upstream of supernova-remnant shocks which\nindicated only a moderate magnetic-field amplification by nonresonant\ninstabilities.

Cognitive Radio enhanced ad-hoc\narchitecture has been put forward as a candidate to enable such networks.\nSpectrum sensing, the cornerstone of the Cognitive Radio paradigm, has been the\nfocus of intensive research, from which the main conclusion was that its\nperformance can be greatly enhanced through the use of cooperative sensing\nschemes. To apply the Cognitive Radio paradigm to Ad-hoc disaster relief\nnetworks, the design of effective cooperative spectrum sensing schemes is\nessential. In this paper we propose a cluster based orchestration cooperative\nsensing scheme, which adapts to the cluster nodes surrounding radio environment\nstate as well as to the degree of correlation observed between those nodes. The\nproposed scheme is given both in a centralized as well as in a decentralized\napproach. In the centralized approach, the cluster head controls and adapts the\ndistribution of the cluster sensing nodes according to the monitored spectrum\nstate. While in the decentralized approach, each of the cluster nodes decides\nwhich spectrum it should monitor, according to the past local sensing decisions\nof the cluster nodes. The centralized and decentralized schemes can be combined\nto achieve a more robust cooperative spectrum sensing scheme. The proposed\nscheme performance is evaluated through a framework, which allows measuring the\naccuracy of the spectrum sensing cooperative scheme by measuring the error in\nthe estimation of the monitored spectrum state. Through this evaluation it is\nshown that the proposed scheme outperforms the case where the choice of which\nspectrum to sense is done without using the knowledge obtained in previous\nsensing iterations, i.e. a implementation of a blind Round Robin scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2009 13:37:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-02"}
