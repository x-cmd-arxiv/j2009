Feng, Rajaraman and Tu have\nsuggested that large (pb to nb) multi-photon or multi-lepton sugnals could be\ngenerated at the LHC through the three-point functions of a\nconformally-invariant hidden sector (an \"unparticle\" sector.) Because of the\nconformal invariance, the kinematic distributions are calculable. However, the\ncross-sections for many such processes grow rapidly with energy, and at some\nhigh scale, to preserve unitarity, conformal invariance must break down.\nRequiring that conformal invariance not be broken, and that no signals be\nalready observed at the Tevatron, we obtain a strong unitarity bound on\nmulti-photon events at the (10 TeV) LHC. For the model of Feng et al., even\nwith extremely conservative assumptions, cross-sections must be below 25 fb,\nand for operator dimension near 2, well below 1 fb. In more general models,\nfour-photon signals could still reach cross-sections of a few pb, though bounds\nbelow 200 fb are more typical. Our methods apply to a wide variety of other\nprocesses and settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Dec 2009 15:04:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

For the static and dynamic\ndescription to be consistent we discovered, using a density functional\ndescription without explicit inclusion of quenched random interactions and a\nmean-field theory, that there be an exponentially large number of metastable\nstates at temperatures less than a critical transition temperature, $T_A$. At a\nlower temperature ($T_K < T_A$), which can be associated with the Kauzmann\ntemperature, the number of glassy states is non-extensive. Based on this theory\nwe formulated an entropic droplet picture to describe transport in finite\ndimensions in the temperature range $T_K < T < T_A$. From the finding that\nglasses are trapped in one of many metastable states below $T_A$ we argue that\nduring the SGT law of large numbers is violated. As a consequence in glasses\nthere are sub sample to sub sample fluctuations provided the system is observed\nfor times longer than the typical relaxation time in a liquid. These\nconsiderations, which find support in computer simulations and experiments,\nalso link the notion of dynamic heterogeneity to the violation of law of large\nnumbers. Thus, the finding that there is an extensive number of metastable\nstates in the range $T_K < T < T_A$ offers a coherent explanation of many of\nthe universal features of glass forming materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Dec 2009 17:57:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-15"}

It is found that\nthe observed luminosities at 5 GHz (L_5GHz) and at 1 keV (L_1keV) are tightly\ncorrelated, and the two kinds of sources can be roughly separated with a\ndivision of L_1keV=L_5GHz. Our SED fits show that the mechanisms of the X-rays\nare diverse. Considering the sources at rest, the synchrotron-self-Compton\n(SSC) scattering would dominate the IC process. This model can interpret the\nX-rays of some hot spots with a magnetic field strength (B_ssc^delta=1) being\nconsistent with the equipartition magnetic field (B_eq^delta=1) in one order of\nmagnitude, but an unreasonably low B_ssc^delta=1 is required to model the\nX-rays for all knots. The ratio R_B=B_eq^delta=1/B_ssc^delta=1 is greater than\n1 and it is tightly anti-correlated with ratio R_L= L_1keV/L_5GHz for both the\nknots and the hot spots. We propose that the deviation may be due to the\nneglect of the relativistic bulk motion for these sources. Considering this\neffect, we show that the IC/CMB model well explains the X-ray emission for most\nsources. Both B_eq' and delta are tentatively correlated with R_L. Corrected by\nthe beaming effect, the L'_5GHz-L'_1keV relations for the two kinds of sources\nare even tighter than the observed ones. These facts suggest that, under the\nequipartition condition, the observational differences of the X-rays from the\nknots and hot spots may be mainly due the differences on the Doppler boosting\neffect and the co-moving magnetic field of the two kinds of sources. Our IC\nscattering models predict a prominent GeV-TeV component in the SEDs for some\nsources, which are detectable with H.E.S.S. and Fermi/LAT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Dec 2009 02:16:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

This variational principle is Hamilton's modified principle\ngeneralized to allow many paths due to the non-local existence of particles in\nphase space. This principle allows a physical system to evolve non-locally in\nphase space while still allowing a representation that uses many classical\npaths. Whereas a point in phase space represents a classical system's state, I\nrepresent the state of a non-local system by a mixed trajectory. This\nformulation naturally leads to the transactional interpretation for resolving\nthe paradoxes of the measurement problem. This principle also suggests a more\nflexible framework for formulating theories based on invariant actions and\nprovides a single conceptual framework for discussing many areas of science.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Dec 2009 03:45:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-15"}

It slips easily off the tongue, and it would\nbe hard to replace. Recently, however, several workers have postulated types of\nhabitable bodies which might exist outside the classic circumstellar habitable\nzone (HZ). These include not only bodies which orbit at substantial distances\nfrom their parent stars, but also snowball worlds with geothermally-maintained\ninternal oceans and even densely-atmosphered worlds with\ngeothermally-maintained surface oceans, which have been ejected from unstable\nplanetary systems into interstellar space. If habitability is not a unique and\ndiagnostic property of the HZ, then the value of the term has been compromised\nin a fundamental way. At the same time, it has become evident that multiple\nenvironmental states, differing in important ways in their habitability, are\npossible even for geophysically similar planets subject to similar levels of\ninsolation, within the classic HZ. We discuss an approach to investigations of\nplanetary habitability which focuses on planetary-scale ecosystems, which are\nhere termed - ecospheres. This is following a usage popular amongst ecologists,\nsuch as Huggett (1999), rather than that of authors such as Strughold (1953)\nand Dole (1964), who used it as a term for the HZ. This approach emphasizes\necodynamic perspectives, which explore the dynamic interactions between the\nbiotic and abiotic factors which together comprise ecosystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Dec 2009 07:59:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-15"}

The rate of change of the\nsystem separation due to mass and angular momentum loss out of the system is\nnegative in all three cases studied, but is ten times smaller for a fast RG\nwind (60 km/s) than for a slow RG wind (20 km/s).
