Accounting for the photometric scatter using\nsimulations, galaxies at z ~ 7 have bluer UV colors compared to typical local\nstarburst galaxies at > 4 sigma confidence. Although these colors necessitate\nyoung ages (<100 Myr), low or zero dust attenuation, and low metallicities,\nthese are explicable by normal (albeit unreddened) stellar populations, with no\nevidence for near-zero metallicities and/or top-heavy initial mass functions.\nThe age of the Universe at these redshifts limits the amount of stellar mass in\nlate-type populations, and the WFC3 photometry implies galaxy stellar masses ~\n10^8 - 10^9 Msol for Salpeter initial mass functions to a limiting magnitude of\nM_1500 ~ -18. The masses of ``characteristic'' (L*) z > 7 galaxies are smaller\nthan those of L* Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) at lower redshifts, and are\ncomparable to less evolved galaxies selected on the basis of their Lyman alpha\nemission at 3 < z < 6, implying that the 6.3 < z < 8.6 galaxies are the\nprogenitors of more evolved galaxies at lower redshifts. We estimate that Lyman\nalpha emission is able to contribute to the observed WFC3 colors of galaxies at\nthese redshifts, with an estimated typical line flux of ~ 10^-18 erg s^-1\ncm^-2, roughly a factor of four below currently planned surveys. The integrated\nUV specific luminosity for the detected galaxies at z ~ 7 and z ~ 8 is within\nfactors of a few of that required to reionize the IGM assuming low clumping\nfactors, implying that in order to reionize the Universe galaxies at these\nredshifts have a high ( ~ 50%) escape fraction of Lyman continuum photons,\npossibly substantiated by the very blue colors of this population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2009 20:23:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2009 20:49:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2009 16:41:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 21 Jun 2010 22:52:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

The CO J=1-0\nemission, with its minimal excitation and density requirements, traces the bulk\nof the metal-rich molecular gas, and reveals a mass of ~10^11 M(sun), extending\nover ~5\" (~25 kpc in the source plane), although there is tentative evidence\nthat it may be significantly larger. Our data suggest that three or more\ndistinct structures are encompassed by this molecular gas reservoir, including\nthe BAL quasar from which the redshift of the SMG was initially determined. In\nparticular, the new rest-frame near-IR observations identify a massive,\nobscured, starburst coincident with a previously known Ly-alpha cloud. This\nstarburst dominates the far-IR emission from the system and requires a\nre-assessment of previous claims that the gas reservoir resides in a massive,\nextended disk around the BAL QSO. Instead it appears that SMM J02399-0136\ncomprises a merger between a far-IR-luminous, but highly obscured starburst,\nthe BAL QSO host and a faint third component.

Because the typical gas fraction of\ngalaxy mergers is expected to increase with redshift, the under-counting of low\ngas-fraction mergers may bias morphological estimates of the evolution of\ngalaxy merger rate. To understand the magnitude of this bias, we explore the\neffect of gas fraction on the morphologies of a series of simulated disc galaxy\nmergers. With the resulting g-band images, we determine how the time-scale for\nidentifying major and minor galaxy mergers via close projected pairs and\nquantitative morphology (the Gini coefficient G, the second-order moment of the\nbrightest 20% of the light M20, and asymmetry A) depends on baryonic gas\nfraction f(gas). Strong asymmetries last significantly longer in high\ngas-fraction mergers of all mass ratios, with time-scales ranging from >= 300\nMyr for f(gas) ~ 20% to >= 1 Gyr for f(gas) ~ 50%. Therefore the strong\nevolution with redshift observed in the fraction of asymmetric galaxies may\nreflect evolution in the gas properties of galaxies rather than the global\ngalaxy merger rate. On the other hand, the time-scale for identifying a galaxy\nmerger via G-M20 is weakly dependent on gas-fraction (~ 200-400 Myr),\nconsistent with the weak evolution observed for G-M20 mergers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2009 21:00:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Aims: We study the\neffects of energetic ion and electron collisions on PAHs in the hot post-shock\ngas behind interstellar shock waves. Methods: We calculate the ion-PAH and\nelectron-PAH nuclear and electronic interactions, above the carbon atom loss\nthreshold, in H II regions and in the hot post-shock gas, for temperatures\nranging from 10^3 to 10^8 K. Results: PAH destruction is dominated by He\ncollisions at low temperatures (T < 3x10^4 K), and by electron collisions at\nhigher temperatures. Smaller PAHs are destroyed faster for T < 10^6 K, but the\ndestruction rates are roughly the same for all PAHs at higher temperatures.

This paper\npresents the first Data Release, consisting of ~20% of the final GASS sample.\nWe use this data set to explore the main scaling relations of HI gas fraction\nwith galaxy structure and NUV-r colour. A large fraction (~60%) of the galaxies\nin our sample are detected in HI. We find that the atomic gas fraction\ndecreases strongly with stellar mass, stellar surface mass density and NUV-r\ncolour, but is only weakly correlated with galaxy bulge-to-disk ratio (as\nmeasured by the concentration index of the r-band light). We also find that the\nfraction of galaxies with significant (more than a few percent) HI decreases\nsharply above a characteristic stellar surface mass density of 10^8.5 Msun\nkpc^-2. The fraction of gas-rich galaxies decreases much more smoothly with\nstellar mass. One of the key goals of GASS is to identify and quantify the\nincidence of galaxies that are transitioning between the blue, star-forming\ncloud and the red sequence of passively-evolving galaxies. Likely transition\ncandidates can be identified as outliers from the mean scaling relations\nbetween gas fraction and other galaxy properties.

Planets causing short-duration events may be in orbits with any\norientation, and may have semimajor axes smaller than an AU, or they may reach\nthe outer limits of their planetary systems, in the region corresponding to the\nSolar System's Oort Cloud. They can have masses larger than Jupiter's or\nsmaller than Pluto's. Lensing therefore has a unique potential to expand our\nunderstanding of planetary systems. A particular advantage of lensing is that\nit can provide precision measurements of system parameters, including the\nmasses of and projected separation between star and planet.

The data consist of 140 of our\nhighest signal-to-noise ratio LBG spectra and ~500 of our most confident\ncolour-selected LBGs. We show that the pairs are composed of two distinct close\nand/or interacting LBGs from a detailed analysis of the rest-frame ultraviolet\nspectra and images. In addition, we show that the pair number and separation\ndistribution is expected from (1) the angular correlation function when applied\nto our survey and ~2500 colour-selected LBGs from the literature and (2) an\nanalysis of a carefully matched high-resolution hybrid numerical and analytical\ncosmological simulation. Because the spectroscopic slitlets have random\norientations with respect to the close pairs on the sky, the serendipitous\npairs provide an unbiased sampling of the underlying close pair fraction.\nFinally, we discover two Ly-a emitters (LAEs) in our slitlets and find that\nthey reside within 50 projected h^-1 kpc of LBGs. In this work, we uncover a\nstrong relationship between Ly-a emission and pair separation. All confirmed\nand all candidate LBG pairs with separations of < 15 projected h^-1 kpc exhibit\nLy-a in emission and we find an overabundance of Ly-a emission in pairs with <\n50 projected h^-1 kpc separations. This relationship suggests a picture in\nwhich a measurable fraction of the Ly-a emission of LBGs, and potentially LAEs,\nis generated via interaction mechanisms. As a result, serendipitous\nspectroscopic close pairs provide a unique means to help identify and study\nhigh-redshift galaxy interactions using conventional ground-based optical data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2009 23:21:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

This paper aims to remedy this situation by transposing the\nusual divisory lines between Star Forming (SF) and AGN hosts, and between\nSeyferts and LINERs to diagrams that are more economical in terms of line\nquality requirements. By doing this, we rescue from the classification limbo a\nsubstantial number of sources and modify the global census of ELGs. More\nspecifically: (1) We use the SDSS DR7 to constitute a suitable sample of 280k\nELGs, 1/3 of which are WLGs. (2) Galaxies with strong emission lines are\nclassified using the widely applied criteria of Kewley et al (2001), Kauffmann\net al (2003), Stasinska et al (2006) and Kewley et al (2006). (3) We transpose\nthese classification schemes to alternative diagrams keeping [NII]/Ha as a\nhorizontal axis, but replacing Hb by a stronger line (Ha or [OII]), or\nsubstituting [OIII]/Hb ratio with the equivalent width of Ha. Optimized\nequations for the transposed divisory lines are provided.

Here we construct a numerical model of V2129 Oph incorporating this\nresult and simulate accretion onto the star. Simulations show that the disk is\ntruncated by the dipole component and matter flows towards the star in two\nfunnel streams. Closer to the star, the flow is redirected by the octupolar\ncomponent, with some of the matter flowing towards the high-latitude poles, and\nthe rest into the octupolar belts. The shape and position of the spots differ\nfrom those in a pure dipole case, where crescent-shaped spots are observed at\nthe intermediate latitudes. Simulations show that if the disk is truncated at\nthe distance of 6.2 R_* which is comparable with the co-rotation radius, 6.8\nR_*, then the high-latitude polar spots dominate, but the accretion rate\nobtained from the simulations is about an order of magnitude lower than the\nobserved one. The accretion rate matches the observed one if the disk is\ndisrupted much closer to the star, at 3.4 R_*. However, the octupolar belt\nspots strongly dominate. Better match has been obtained in experiments with a\ndipole field twice as strong. The torque on the star from the\ndisk-magnetosphere interaction is small, and the time-scale of spin evolution,\n2 x10^7-10^9 years is longer than the 2x10^6 years age of V2129 Oph. The\nexternal magnetic flux of the star is strongly influenced by the disk: the\nfield lines connecting the disk and the star inflate and form magnetic towers\nabove and below the disk.

Traditionally\nthese processes have been modeled in a piece-meal fashion, relying on\nphenomenological treatments such as Simmons and Richardson equations that are\nnot vetted in atomistic systems and do not flow seamlessly into each other. We\npresent a unified modeling approach, based on the Non-equilibrium Greens\nfunction (NEGF) formalism that allows us to integrate diverse transport regimes\nand establish a comprehensive quantitative theory. By comparing our simulations\nwith experiments on a metal-molecule-semiconductor junction (varying molecular\nlengths ~1-3nm), we identify the role of molecular monolayers in tuning the\nsemiconductor band-bending, and thereby overall device conductivity. We find\nthat the principal role of molecules is to act as a voltage divider, altering\nthe Schottky barriers, thereby modulating current levels, voltage-asymmetries\nand crossover from Schottky to tunneling transport. While this provides an\nappealingly simple explanation for our observed experimental trends, the\ncalculated shifts in crossover voltages are insufficient to explain the\nexperiments quantitatively. Quantitative correspondence with experiments\nrequires invocation of an additional voltage divider arising from molecular\ndipoles that further tunes semiconductor band-bending.

The main features of the new\ndesign and first results of performance improvement and testing simplification\nare presented; they are relevant to many Geant4 applications, where\ncomputational speed and the containment of resources invested in simulation\nproduction and quality assurance play a critical role.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2009 10:03:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-10"}

The NGC 4636 GC system shows weak overall\nrotation, which is dominated by the red GCs. However, both the blue GCs and red\nGCs show some rotation in the inner region at R<4.3'. The velocity dispersion\nfor all the GCs is derived to be sigma_p = 225{+12-9} km/s. The velocity\ndispersion for the blue GCs (sig=251 km/s) is slightly larger than that for the\nred GCs (sig=205 km/s). The velocity dispersions for the blue GCs about the\nmean velocity and about the best fit rotation curve have a significant\nvariation depending on the galactocentric radius. Comparison of observed\nstellar and GC velocity dispersion profiles with the velocity dispersion\nprofiles calculated from the stellar mass profile shows that the mass-to-light\nratio should increase as the galactocentric distance increases, indicating the\nexistence of an extended dark matter halo. From the comparison of the observed\nGC velocity dispersion profiles and the velocity dispersion profiles calculated\nfor the X-ray mass profiles in the literature, we find that the orbit of the GC\nsystem is tangential, and that the orbit of the red GCs is slightly more\ntangential than that of the blue GCs. We compare the GC kinematics of NGC 4636\nwith those of other six gEs, finding that the kinematic properties of the GCs\nare diverse among gEs. We find several correlations between the kinematics of\nthe GCs and the global parameters of their host galaxies. We discuss the\nimplication of the results for the formation models of the GC system in gEs,\nand suggest a mixture scenario for the origin of the GCs in gEs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2009 11:44:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

As one tunes the separation\nbetween ends of a rod, the system remains stable beyond the instability and\ndevelops a double well potential for transverse motion. The two minima in\npotential energy curve describe two possible buckled states at a particular\nstrain. From one buckled state it can go over to the other by thermal\nfluctuations or quantum tunnelling. Using a continuum approach and transition\nstate theory (TST) one can calculate the rate of conversion from one state to\nother.

The rate, however, diverges at the second buckling instability.\nAt this point, the straight rod configuration, which was a saddle till then,\nbecomes hill top and two new saddles are generated.

Indicated (among\nothers) by several recent N-body simulations, this correlation is privileged by\nthe form of the radial pressure term in the Jeans equation, and yields a main\nbody profile consistent with the classic self-similar development of DM halos.\nIn addition, we require the Jeans solutions to satisfy regular boundary\nconditions both at the center (finite pressure, round gravitational potential)\nand in the outskirts (finite overall mass).

Images have always been problematic to describe and catalogue due to\nlack of inherent textual data and ambiguity of meaning. An alternative to\ntime-consuming professionally-applied metadata has been sought in the form of\ntags, simple keywords that form a flat structure known as distributed\nclassification, or more popularly as a folksonomy.\n  This research aims to increase understanding of why people tag and how\neffective they find it for searching, using as the focus. Open-ended\nquestionnaires were sent out to members of the photo-sharing website Flickr,\nwith the opportunity to post comments to an online discussion space. There is\nalso a systematic comparison between a tag-based system and a more traditional\ncontrolled vocabulary, to test out the claims made regarding the suitability of\ntagging for searching and browsing. For this purpose Flickr has been compared\nwith Getty Images using a series of test themes.\n  The small number of people who replied to the questionnaire gave detailed\nanswers that confirmed several assertions made about tags: they are accepted\ndespite their flaws (sloppiness and potential for inaccuracy) because they\nserve their purpose to a satisfactory level. Some answers challenged the\nassumption that tagging is only done for personal benefit. The search\ncomparison found that while Getty allows highly specific queries and logical\nsemantic links, Flickr is more flexible and better placed to deal with subtle\nconcepts. The overall conclusion is that tags achieve most when used in\nconjunction with groupings of people with a shared interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2009 15:11:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-10"}

Previous work has shown\nthat although it takes longer to make signs than to say the equivalent words,\non average sentences can be completed in about the same time. This leaves\nunresolved, however, precisely why that should be the case. This paper reports\na determination of the empirical entropy and redundancy in the set of\nhandshapes of ASL. In this context, the entropy refers to the average\ninformation content in a unit of data. It is found that the handshapes, as\nfundamental units of ASL, are less redundant than phonemes, the equivalent\nfundamental units of spoken English, and that their entropy is much closer to\nthe maximum possible information content. This explains why the slower signs\ncan produce sentences in the same time as speaking; the low redundancy\ncompensates for the slow rate of sign production. In addition to this precise\nquantification, this work is also novel in its approach towards quantifying an\naspect of the ASL alphabet. Unlike spoken and written languages, frequency\nanalysis of ASL is difficult due to the fact that every sign is composed of\nphonemes that are created through a combination of manual and a relatively\nlarge and imprecise set of bodily features. Focusing on handshapes as the\nubiquitous and universal feature of all sign languages permits a precise\nquantitative analysis. As interest in visual electronic communication explodes\nwithin the deaf community, this work also paves the way for more precise\nautomated sign recognition and synthesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2009 15:07:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-10"}
