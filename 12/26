In this paper, we consider a cognitive radio\nnetwork in which a primary user shares a channel with secondary users that\ncannot distinguish the signals of the primary user from those of a secondary\nuser. We propose a class of distributed cognitive MAC protocols to achieve\nefficient spectrum sharing among the secondary users while protecting the\nprimary user from potential interference by the secondary users. By using a MAC\nprotocol with one-slot memory, we can obtain high channel utilization by the\nsecondary users while limiting interference to the primary user at a low level.\nThe results of this paper suggest the possibility of utilizing MAC design in\ncognitive radio networks to overcome limitations in spectrum sensing at the PHY\nlayer as well as to achieve spectrum sharing at the MAC layer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Dec 2009 01:44:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2010 10:22:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-05"}

All these phenomena are inherent\nto nanos made of materials belonging to all ninety bulk magnetic classes.\nTherefore the new linear magnetoelectrics should appear among nanomaterials,\nnonpiezomagnetic and nonpiezoelectric in the bulk. To demonstrate this we\nconsider the typical cases of ultra-thin films, nanowires and nanospheres.\nCoupled with a surface stress for nanoparticles and a mismatch strains for thin\nfilms on substrates the surface piezomagnetic and piezoelectric effects lead to\nthe appearance of built-in magnetic and electric fields respectively. The\nbuilt-in fields play an important role in the appearance of self-magnetization\nand self-polarization in the nanosystems paramagnetic and paraelectric in the\nbulk and can lead to the appearance of some other interesting properties absent\nin the bulk. We obtained analytical dependencies on sizes for the built-in\nfields and magnetoelectric coupling coefficients. The values of the built-in\nfields increase with the decrease of film thickness h or nanoparticles radii R\nas ~1/h or 1/R2 respectively, while the magnetoelectric coupling is inversely\nproportional to the sizes in both cases.

K-shell transition lines from highly ionized ions of various\nelements were detected, including Chromium (Cr-Kalpha at 5.61 keV). The X-ray\ncontinuum spectra were modeled in the 3.4--40 keV band, summed over the entire\nremnant, and were fitted with a simplest combination of the thermal\nbremsstrahlung and the non-thermal cut-off power-law models. The spectral fits\nwith this assumption indicate that the continuum emission is likely to be\ndominated by the non-thermal emission with a cut-off energy at > 1 keV. The\nthermal-to-nonthermal fraction of the continuum flux in the 4-10 keV band is\nbest estimated as ~0.1. Non-thermal-dominated continuum images in the 4--14 keV\nband were made. The peak of the non-thermal X-rays appears at the western part.\nThe peak position of the TeV gamma-rays measured with HEGRA and MAGIC is also\nshifted at the western part with the 1-sigma confidence. Since the location of\nthe X-ray continuum emission was known to be presumably identified with the\nreverse shock region, the possible keV-TeV correlations give a hint that the\naccelerated multi-TeV hadrons in Cassiopeia A are dominated by heavy elements\nin the reverse shock region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Dec 2009 14:31:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

In this paper we show, using a Hamiltonian\nclassical-field formalism, that temporal correlations can be used to\ncharacterize familiar properties of a finite-temperature degenerate Bose gas.\nThe temporal coherence of a Bose-Einstein condensate is limited only by the\nslow diffusion of its phase, and thus the presence of a condensate is indicated\nby a sharp feature in the temporal power spectrum of the field. We show that\nthe condensate mode can be obtained by averaging the field for a short time in\nan appropriate phase-rotating frame, and that for a wide range of temperatures,\nthe condensate obtained in this approach agrees well with that defined by the\nPenrose-Onsager criterion based on one-body (spatial) correlations. For time\nperiods long compared to the phase diffusion time, the field will average to\nzero, as we would expect from the overall U(1) symmetry of the Hamiltonian. We\nidentify the emergence of the first moment on short time scales with the\nconcept of U(1) symmetry breaking that is central to traditional mean-field\ntheories of Bose condensation. We demonstrate that the short-time averaging\nprocedure constitutes a general analog of the 'anomalous' averaging operation\nof symmetry-broken theories by calculating the anomalous thermal density of the\nfield, which we find to have form and temperature dependence consistent with\nthe results of mean-field theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Dec 2009 15:12:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 May 2010 13:56:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 19 Jul 2010 12:04:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-20"}

Our results indicate\nthat, contrary to what is expected, T$_c$ increases by increasing the amount of\ndisorder. We argue that this behavior is due to the dynamics of the tubes which\nreduces the drastic effect of the local disorder on superconductivity by\nenhancing the intertube Josephson tunneling. We also found that T$_c$ is\nenhanced as the effective dimensionality of the rope increases by increasing\nthe number N of the tubes forming the rope.
