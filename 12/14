(2009; W09), but extends to lower\nredshifts and has specific star formation rates which are lower by ~0.6 dex. We\nidentify outflows of cool gas from the Doppler shift of the MgII absorption\nlines and find that the equivalent width (EW) of absorption due to outflowing\ngas increases on average with M_* and star formation rate (SFR). We attribute\nthe large EWs measured in spectra of the more massive, higher-SFR galaxies to\noptically thick absorbing clouds having large velocity widths. The outflows\nhave hydrogen column densities N(H) > 10^19.3 cm^-2, and extend to velocities\nof ~500 km/s. While galaxies with SFR > 10 Msun/yr host strong outflows in both\nthis and the W09 sample, we do not detect outflows in lower-SFR (i.e., log\nM_*/Msun < 10.5) galaxies at lower redshifts. Using a simple galaxy evolution\nmodel which assumes exponentially declining SFRs, we infer that strong outflows\npersist in galaxies with log M_*/Msun > 10.5 as they age between z=1.4 and z~1,\npresumably because of their high absolute SFRs. Finally, using high resolution\nHST/ACS imaging in tandem with our spectral analysis, we find evidence for a\nweak trend (at 1 sigma significance) of increasing outflow absorption strength\nwith increasing galaxy SFR surface density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Dec 2009 19:49:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

Covariance graph models have recently received much\nattention in the literature and constitute a sub-family of graphical models.\nThough they are conceptually simple to understand, they are considerably more\ndifficult to analyze. Under some suitable assumption on the probability\ndistribution, covariance graph models can also be used to represent more\ncomplex conditional independence relationships between subsets of variables.\nWhen the covariance graph captures or reflects all the conditional independence\nstatements present in the probability distribution the latter is said to be\nfaithful to its covariance graph - though no such prior guarantee exists.\nDespite the increasingly widespread use of these two types of graphical models,\nto date no deep probabilistic analysis of this class of models, in terms of the\nfaithfulness assumption, is available.

Of particular interest is the\nbiologically relevant situation of numerous interacting genetic loci with small\nindividual contributions to fitness. Here, we present a computational model of\nselection dynamics involving many epistatic loci in a recombining population.\nWe demonstrate that a large number of polymorphic interacting loci can, despite\nfrequent recombination, exhibit cooperative behavior that locks alleles into\nfavorable genotypes leading to a population consisting of a set of competing\nclones. When the recombination rate exceeds a certain critical value that\ndepends on the strength of epistasis, this \"genotype selection\" regime\ndisappears in an abrupt transition, giving way to \"allele selection\"-the regime\nwhere different loci are only weakly correlated as expected in sexually\nreproducing populations. We show that large populations attain highest fitness\nat a recombination rate just below critical. Clustering of interacting sets of\ngenes on a chromosome leads to the emergence of an intermediate regime, where\nblocks of cooperating alleles lock into genetic modules. These haplotype blocks\ndisappear in a second transition to pure allele selection.

To understand and model the evolution of HIV quantitatively,\nthe parameters governing genetic diversification and the strength of selection\nneed to be known. While mutation rates can be measured in single replication\ncycles, the relevant effective recombination rate depends on the probability of\ncoinfection of a cell with more than one virus and can only be inferred from\npopulation data. However, most population genetic estimators for recombination\nrates assume absence of selection and are hence of limited applicability to\nHIV, since positive and purifying selection are important in HIV evolution.\nHere, we estimate the rate of recombination and the distribution of selection\ncoefficients from time-resolved sequence data tracking the evolution of HIV\nwithin single patients. By examining temporal changes in the genetic\ncomposition of the population, we estimate the effective recombination to be\nr=1.4e-5 recombinations per site and generation. Furthermore, we provide\nevidence that selection coefficients of at least 15% of the observed\nnon-synonymous polymorphisms exceed 0.8% per generation. These results provide\na basis for a more detailed understanding of the evolution of HIV. A\nparticularly interesting case is evolution in response to drug treatment, where\nrecombination can facilitate the rapid acquisition of multiple resistance\nmutations.

Two methods, the Sync-based Explicit-time\nDescription Method using rendezvous synchronization steps and the\nSemaphore-based Explicit-time Description Method using only one global variable\nwere proposed; they both achieve better modularity than Lamport's method in\nmodeling the real-time systems.

In this\npaper, we propose a more efficient method which enables the Tick process to\nleap multiple time units in one tick.

Because such operations are the building blocks of most scientific\napplications, conventional supercomputers are still strongly predominant in\nhigh-performance computing and the use of grids for speeding up large-scale\nscientific problems is limited to applications exhibiting parallelism at a\nhigher level. We have identified two performance bottlenecks in the distributed\nmemory algorithms implemented in ScaLAPACK, a state-of-the-art dense linear\nalgebra library. First, because ScaLAPACK assumes a homogeneous communication\nnetwork, the implementations of ScaLAPACK algorithms lack locality in their\ncommunication pattern. Second, the number of messages sent in the ScaLAPACK\nalgorithms is significantly greater than other algorithms that trade flops for\ncommunication. In this paper, we present a new approach for computing a QR\nfactorization -- one of the main dense linear algebra kernels -- of tall and\nskinny matrices in a grid computing environment that overcomes these two\nbottlenecks. Our contribution is to articulate a recently proposed algorithm\n(Communication Avoiding QR) with a topology-aware middleware (QCG-OMPI) in\norder to confine intensive communications (ScaLAPACK calls) within the\ndifferent geographical sites. An experimental study conducted on the Grid'5000\nplatform shows that the resulting performance increases linearly with the\nnumber of geographical sites on large-scale problems (and is in particular\nconsistently higher than ScaLAPACK's).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2009 04:01:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

When performing a precise measurement of the position\nof an oscillator, this coupling results in quantum radiation pressure noise. Up\nto now this effect has not been observed yet. Generally speaking, the strength\nof radiation pressure noise increases when the effective mass of the oscillator\nis decreased or when the power of the reflected light is increased. Recently,\nextremely light SiN membranes with high mechanical Q-values at room temperature\nhave attracted attention as low thermal noise mechanical oscillators. However,\nthe power reflectance of these membranes is much lower than unity which makes\nthe use of advanced interferometer recycling techniques to amplify the\nradiation pressure noise in a standard Michelson interferometer inefficient.\nHere, we propose and theoretically analyze a Michelson-Sagnac interferometer\nthat includes the membrane as a common end mirror for the Michelson\ninterferometer part. In this new topology, both, power- and signal-recycling\ncan be used even if the reflectance of the membrane is much lower than unity.\nIn particular, signal-recycling is a useful tool because it does not involve a\npower increase at the membrane.

The feasibility of fusion energy production\nrelies on our ability to confine these energetic particles, while keeping the\nthermonuclear plasma in safe operating conditions. For that purpose, it is\nnecessary to understand and find ways to control the interaction between\nenergetic particles and the thermonuclear plasma. Reaching these two goals is\nthe general motivation for the work conducted during the PhD. More\nspecifically, our focus is on one type of instability, the Beta Alfven\nEigenmode (BAE), which can be driven by energetic particles and impact on the\nconfinement of both energetic and thermal particles. In this work, we study the\ncharacteristics of BAEs analytically and derive its dispersion relation and\nstructure. Next, we analyze the linear stability of the mode in the presence of\nenergetic particles. First, a purely linear description is used, which makes\npossible to get an analytical linear criterion for BAE destabilization in the\npresence of energetic particles. This criterion is compared with experiments\nconducted in the Tore-Supra tokamak during the PhD. Secondly, because the\nlinear analysis reveals some features of the BAE stability which are subject to\na strong nonlinear modification, the question is raised of the possibility of a\nsub-critical activity of the mode. We propose a simple scenario which makes\npossible the existence of meta-stable modes, verified analytically and\nnumerically.

Idealized hydrodynamical N-body simulations with a star\nformation prescription are used to study the minor merger process between a\ngiant galaxy (host) and a less massive spiral galaxy (satellite) with\nreasonable assumptions for the ages and metallicities of the merger\nprogenitors.

The newly formed stars are mainly located in the\ncentral part of the satellite remnant while the older stars of the initial disk\nare deposited at larger radii in shell-like structures. After the final plunge\nof the satellite, star formation in the central part of the remnant can\ncontinue for several Gyrs depending on the star formation efficiency. Although\nthe mass fraction in new stars is small, we find that the half-mass radius\ndiffers from the half-light radius in the V and H bands. Moreover synthetic 2D\nimages in J, H, NUV, Hb and V bands, using the characteristic filters of the\nWide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), reveal that\nresidual star formation induced by gas-rich minor mergers can be clearly\nobserved during and after the final plunge, especially in the NUV band, for\ninteracting systems at (z<0.023) over moderate numbers of orbits (~2 orbits\ncorrespond to typical exposure times of ~3600 sec).

We show that $PT$ symmetry of a time-independent\nHamiltonian, or equivalently, reality of the secular equation that determines\nits eigenvalues, is both necessary and sufficient for unitary time evolution.\nFor any $PT$-symmetric Hamiltonian $H$ there always exists an operator $V$ that\nrelates $H$ to its Hermitian adjoint according to $VHV^{-1}=H^{\\dagger}$.

The correlation for 21\nreverberation-mapped Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) appears very tight, with an\nintrinsic dispersion of 0.20 dex. The intrinsic dispersion of 0.27 dex can be\nobtained if BH masses are estimated from the stellar velocity dispersions. We\nfurther test the uncertainties of mass estimates from XVAs for objects which\nhave been observed multiple times with good enough data quality. The results\nshow that the XVAs derived from multiple observations change by a factor of 3.\nThis means that BH mass uncertainty from a single observation is slightly worse\nthan either reverberation-mapping or stellar velocity dispersion measurements;\nhowever BH mass estimates with X-ray data only can be more accurate if the mean\nXVA value from more observations is used. Applying this relation, the BH mass\nof RE J1034+396 is found to be $4^{+3}_{-2} \\times 10^6$ $M_{\\odot}$. The high\nend of the mass range follows the relationship between the 2$f_0$ frequencies\nof high-frequency QPO and the BH masses derived from the Galactic X-ray\nbinaries. We also calculate the high-frequency constant $C= 2.37 M_\\odot$\nHz$^{-1}$ from 21 reverberation-mapped AGN.

Magnetic Bright Points (MBPs) are small-scale magnetic features in\nthe solar photosphere.

The number and\nsize distribution are of vital importance in estimating the small\nscale-magnetic-field energy. Aims. The size distribution of MBPs is derived for\nG-band images acquired by the Hinode/SOT instrument. Methods. For\nidentification purposes, a new automated segmentation and identification\nalgorithm was developed. Results. For a sampling of 0.108 arcsec/pixel, we\nderived a mean diameter of (218 +- 48) km for the MBPs. For the full resolved\ndata set with a sampling of 0.054 arcsec/pixel, the size distribution shifted\nto a mean diameter of (166 +- 31) km. The determined diameters are consistent\nwith earlier published values. The shift is most probably due to the different\nspatial sampling. Conclusions.

ASTEP South became\nfully functional in June 2008 and obtained 1592 hours of data during the 2008\nAntarctic winter.

The pointing direction is stable within 10 arcseconds\non a daily timescale and drifts by only 34 arcseconds in 50 days. A truly\ncontinuous photometry of bright stars is possible in June (the noon sky\nbackground peaks at a magnitude R=15 arcsec-2 on June 22), but becomes\nchallenging in July (the noon sky background magnitude is R=12.5 arcsec?2 on\nJuly 20).

The results\ncontained in this paper, taken together with those contained in \\cite{BZ09},\nillustrate the central role of the Poincar\\'e polynomial in algorithmic\nalgebraic geometry, as well as, in computational complexity theory over the\ncomplex and real numbers -- namely, the ability to compute it efficiently\nenables one to decide in polynomial time all languages in the (compact)\npolynomial hierarchy over the appropriate field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2009 14:50:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2009 14:31:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2009 21:43:13 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2009 22:08:56 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 3 Jan 2010 16:46:48 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 1 Mar 2010 18:49:53 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2011 10:06:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-17"}

Coated conductors are likely the best examples, consisting of\nvery good quality thin layers of YBCO superconductor grown on top of a metallic\ntape with some intermediate layers. However, there is an important problem for\nachieving large currents: a large decrease in transport critical-current\ndensity Jc when increasing film thickness has been observed in coated\nconductors made by all available techniques. Here, we theoretically explain the\nnature and the ubiquitous presence of this so-called thickness effect by\nanalyzing the self-field created by the transport currents in the\nsuperconductor, assuming a realistic field-dependent Jc.

Studies of the governing equation, both\ntheoretical and numerical, have shown that the Hall effect proceeds in a\nturbulent cascade of energy from large to small scales. We investigate the\nsmall-scale Hall instability conjectured to exist from the linear stability\nanalysis of Rheinhardt and Geppert. Identical linear stability analyses are\nperformed to find a suitable background field to model Rheinhardt and Geppert's\nideas. The nonlinear evolution of this field is then modelled using a\nthree-dimensional pseudospectral numerical MHD code. Combined with the\nbackground field, energy was injected at the ten specific eigenmodes with the\ngreatest positive eigenvalues as inferred by the linear stability analysis.\nEnergy is transferred to different scales in the system, but not into small\nscales to any extent that could be interpreted as a Hall instability. Any\ninstabilities are overwhelmed by a late-onset turbulent Hall cascade, initially\navoided by the choice of background field, but soon generated by nonlinear\ninteractions between the growing eigenmodes. The Hall cascade is shown here,\nand by several authors elsewhere, to be the dominant mechanism in this system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2009 15:01:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}
