The theory admits a Veneziano\nexpansion of large N_c and large N_f, with N_f/N_c and lambda = g^2 N_c kept\nfixed. The topological structure of large N diagrams motivates a general\nconjecture: the flavor-singlet sector of a gauge theory in the Veneziano limit\nis dual to a closed string theory; single closed string states correspond to\n\"generalized single-trace\" operators, where adjoint letters and\nflavor-contracted fundamental/antifundamental pairs are stringed together in a\nclosed chain. We look for the string dual of N = 2 superconformal QCD from two\nfronts. From the bottom-up, we perform a systematic analysis of the protected\nspectrum using superconformal representation theory. We also evaluate the\none-loop dilation operator in the scalar sector, finding a novel spin chain.\n  From the top-down, we consider the decoupling limit of known brane\nconstructions. In both approaches, more insight is gained by viewing the theory\nas the degenerate limit of the N = 2 Z_2 orbifold of N = 4 SYM, as one of the\ntwo gauge couplings is tuned to zero. A consistent picture emerges. We conclude\nthat the string dual is a sub-critical background with seven \"geometric\"\ndimensions, containing both an AdS_5 and an S^1 factor. The supergravity\napproximation is never entirely valid, even for large lambda, indeed the field\ntheory has an exponential degeneracy of exactly protected states with higher\nspin, which must be dual to a sector of light string states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Dec 2009 08:39:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-31"}

This modification is designed to better describe\nelectromagnetic (EM) phenomena at atomic scales. It includes a modification of\nthe concept of the classical EM field and a new model for the elementary charge\nwhich we call a balanced charge (b-charge). A b-charge does not interact with\nitself electromagnetically, and every b-charge possesses its own elementary EM\nfield. The EM energy is naturally partitioned as the interaction energy between\npairs of different b-charges. We construct EM theory of b-charges (BEM) based\non a relativistic Lagrangian with the following properties: (i) b-charges\ninteract only through their elementary EM potentials and fields; (ii) the field\nequations for the elementary EM fields are exactly the Maxwell equations with\nproper currents; (iii) a free charge moves uniformly preserving up to the\nLorentz contraction its shape; (iv) the Newton equations with the Lorentz\nforces hold approximately when charges are well separated and move with\nnon-relativistic velocities.

In the dilute limit where\nfluid-mediated interactions can be treated rigorously, the long-time\nhydrodynamics of a collection of cells result from interactions with many other\ncells, and as such typically eludes an analytical approach. Here we consider\nthe only case where such problem can be treated rigorously analytically, namely\nwhen the cells have spatially confined trajectories, such as the spermatozoa of\nsome marine invertebrates. We consider two spherical cells swimming, when\nisolated, with arbitrary circular trajectories, and derive the long-time\nkinematics of their relative locomotion. We show that in the dilute limit where\nthe cells are much further away than their size, and the size of their circular\nmotion, a separation of time scale occurs between a fast (intrinsic) swimming\ntime, and a slow time where hydrodynamic interactions lead to change in the\nrelative position and orientation of the swimmers. We perform a multiple-scale\nanalysis and derive the effective dynamical system - of dimension two -\ndescribing the long-time behavior of the pair of cells. We show that the system\ndisplays one type of equilibrium, and two types of rotational equilibrium, all\nof which are found to be unstable.

In particular we implement\nordering vector optimization on the ordered reference state of MSW theory,\nwhich leads to significant improvement of the theory and accounts for quantum\ncorrections to the classically ordered state. The MSW results at zero\ntemperature compare favorably to exact diagonalization (ED) and projected\nentangled-pair state (PEPS) calculations. The resulting zero-temperature phase\ndiagram includes a 1D quasi-ordered phase, a 2D Neel ordered phase, and a 2D\nspiraling ordered phase. We have strong indications that the various ordered or\nquasi-ordered phases are separated by spin-liquid phases with short-range\ncorrelations, in analogy to what has been predicted for the Heisenberg model on\nthe same lattice. Within MSW theory we also explore the finite-temperature\nphase diagram. We find that the zero-temperature long-range-ordered phases turn\ninto quasi-ordered phases (up to a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless\ntemperature), while zero-temperature quasi-ordered phases become short-range\ncorrelated at finite temperature. These results show that modified spin-wave\ntheory is very well suited for describing ordered and quasi-ordered phases of\nfrustrated XY spins (or, equivalently, of frustrated lattice bosons) both at\nzero and finite temperatures. While MSW theory, just as other theoretical\nmethods, cannot describe spin-liquid phases, its breakdown provides a fast\nmethod for singling out Hamiltonians which may feature these intriguing quantum\nphases. We thus suggest a tool for guiding our search for interesting systems\nwhose properties are necessarily studied with a physical quantum simulator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Dec 2009 12:27:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-06"}

Let p be a\nhomogeneous polynomial of degree m on S^2(R^n) which is hyperbolic with respect\nto the all positive directions A \\geq 0.

Motivated by this luminosity problem, we present a set\nof evolutionary models describing the collapse of low-mass, dense cores into\nprotostars, using the Young & Evans (2005) model as our starting point. We\ncalculate the radiative transfer of the collapsing cores throughout the full\nduration of the collapse in two dimensions.

We find that scattering, 2-D geometry, mass-loss, and\noutflow cavities all affect the model predictions, as expected, but none\nresolve the luminosity problem. A cycle of episodic mass accretion, however,\ncan resolve this problem and bring the model predictions into better agreement\nwith observations. Standard assumptions about the interplay between mass\naccretion and mass loss in our model give star formation efficiencies\nconsistent with recent observations that compare the core mass function (CMF)\nand stellar initial mass function (IMF).

Unfortunately, strong\nabsorption in aqueous solutions and low spatial resolution return difficult\nfree-space investigations. A new approach based on integrated THz circuits was\nused. The authors designed and fabricated a BioMEMS (Biological\nMicroElectro-Mechanical System) compatible with microfluidic circulation and\nelectromagnetic propagation. It is dedicated to the ex vivo detection of nitric\noxide synthase (NOS) activity, which is involved in neurodegenerative\nphenomena. MATERIAL/METHODS: The biological model was a leech's central nervous\nsystem. After its injury, the production of NO was observed and measured in the\nfar-THz spectral domain. The nerve cord was put inside a BioMEMS realized in\npolydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) sealed on a glass wafer. Glass is a good material\nfor supporting high-frequency integrated waveguides such as coplanar waveguides\n(CPWs). Measurements were performed with vectorial network analyser (VNA).\nRESULTS: The transmission parameter in the frequency range of 0.14-0.22 THz was\nmeasured through CPWs located just below the microchannel containing the\ninjured leech nerve cord. The lesion caused a decreased transmission\ncoefficient due to the NOS activity. L-NAME was injected inside the\nmicrochannel and it was verified that it inhibits this activity. CONCLUSIONS:\nIt was demonstrated that THz spectroscopy can detect a biochemical event, such\nas NOS activity around an injured leech's nerve cord, in real time. Future\nstudies will be dedicated to quantitative measurements of the reaction products\nusing the sophisticated management of several drugs allowed with microfluidic\nmicrosystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Dec 2009 01:45:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-31"}

Of particular interest is the possibility to develop\npredictive capabilities for social diffusion, for instance enabling early\nidentification of diffusion processes which are likely to become \"viral\" and\npropagate to a significant fraction of the population. Recently we have shown,\nusing theoretical analysis, that the dynamics of social diffusion may depend\ncrucially upon the interactions of social network communities, that is, densely\nconnected groupings of individuals which have only relatively few links between\ngroups. This paper presents an empirical investigation of two related\nhypotheses which follow from this finding: 1.) inter-community interaction is\npredictive of the reach of social diffusion and 2.) dispersion of the diffusion\nphenomenon across network communities is a useful early indicator that the\npropagation will be \"successful\". We explore these hypotheses with case studies\ninvolving the emergence of the Swedish Social Democratic Party at the turn of\nthe 20th century, the spread of the SARS virus in 2002-2003, and blogging\ndynamics associated with real world protest activity. These empirical studies\ndemonstrate that network community-based diffusion metrics do indeed possess\npredictive power, and in fact can be more useful than standard measures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Dec 2009 02:10:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-31"}

When combined with neutral hydrogen (HI) data obtained\nwith the Arecibo 305-m radiotelescope, acquired by Levy et al. (2007) and by\nSpringob et al.

The specific star formation rate (SSFR)\nis quantified by the logarithmic flux ratio of H-alpha flux to R band flux, and\nthus roughly characterizes the logarithmic SFR per unit stellar mass. We find a\nclear correlation between the global SFR per unit stellar mass and DEF, such\nthat the SFR is lower in more HI-deficient galaxies. This correlation appears\nto extend from the most gas-rich to the most gas-poor galaxies. We also find a\ncorrelation between the central SFR per unit mass relative to the global\nvalues, in the sense that the more HI-deficient galaxies have a higher central\nSFR per unit mass relative to their global SFR values than do gas-rich\ngalaxies. In fact, approximately half of the HI-depleted galaxies have highly\nelevated SSFRs in their central regions, indicative of a transient evolutionary\nstate. In addition, we find a correlation between gas-depletion and the size of\nthe H-alpha disk (relative to the R band disk); HI-poor galaxies have truncated\ndisks.

It is very interesting and crucial that if we can introduce the radial\ncontrolling freedom, which undoubtedly opens a new way to provide the\nflexibility for creating the desired vector fields and for fulfilling the\nrequirement on a variety of applications.

We focus on the density and temperature regime for which\ncharged spin-0 nuclei form an interacting charged Bose-Einstein condensate,\nwhile the neutralizing electrons form a degenerate fermi gas. After a brief\nintroductory review, we summarize distinctive properties of the charged\ncondensate, such as a mass gap in the bosonic sector as well as gapless\nfermionic excitations. Charged impurities placed in the condensate are screened\nwith great efficiency, greater than in an equivalent uncondensed plasma. We\ndiscuss a generalization of the Friedel potential which takes into account\nbosonic collective excitations in addition to the fermionic excitations. We\nargue that the charged condensate could exist in helium-core white dwarf stars\nand discuss the evolution of these dwarfs. Condensation would lead to a\nsignificantly faster rate of cooling than that of carbon- or oxygen-core dwarfs\nwith crystallized cores. This prediction can be tested observationally:\nsignatures of charged condensation may have already been seen in the recently\ndiscovered sequence of helium-core dwarfs in the nearby globular cluster NGC\n6397. Sufficiently strong magnetic fields can penetrate the condensate within\nAbrikosov-like vortices. We find approximate analytic vortex solutions and\ncalculate the values of the lower and upper critical magnetic fields at which\nvortices are formed and destroyed respectively. The lower critical field is\nwithin the range of fields observed in white dwarfs, but tends toward the\nhigher end of this interval.

Current mapping of these reads, grading\nthem according to 0, 1 or 2 mismatches wastes a great deal of information.\nThese short sequences are typically mapped with no account of the accuracy of\nthe sequence, even in company software when per base error rates are being\nreported by another part of the machine. Further, multiply mapping locations\nare frequently discarded altogether or allocated with no regard to where other\nreads are accumulating. Here we show how to combine probabilistic mapping of\nreads with an EM algorithm to iteratively improve the empirical likelihood of\nthe allocation of short reads. Mapping using LAST takes into account the per\nbase accuracy of the read, plus insertions and deletions, plus anticipated\noccasional errors or SNPs with respect to the parent genome. The probabilistic\nEM algorithm iteratively allocates reads based on the proportion of reads\nmapping within windows on the previous cycle, along with any prior information\non where the read best maps. The methods are illustrated with FAIRE ENCODE data\nlooking at the very important head-to-head gene combination of TP53 and WRAP\n53.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Dec 2009 15:27:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-31"}
