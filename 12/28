We also show that the\ndecoding complexity of the proposed method is basically identical with that of\nthe conventional one based on the original error trellis. Next, we apply the\nmethod to check matrices with monomial entries proposed by Tanner et al. By\nchoosing any row of the check matrix as the submatrix for error-trellis\nconstruction, a 1-state error trellis is obtained.

This work presents a\nperspective of progress in the field of control over quantum phenomena, tracing\nthe evolution of theoretical concepts and experimental methods from early\ndevelopments to the most recent advances. The current experimental successes\nwould be impossible without the development of intense femtosecond laser\nsources and pulse shapers. The two most critical theoretical insights were (1)\nrealizing that ultrafast atomic and molecular dynamics can be controlled via\nmanipulation of quantum interferences and (2) understanding that optimally\nshaped ultrafast laser pulses are the most effective means for producing the\ndesired quantum interference patterns in the controlled system. Finally, these\ntheoretical and experimental advances were brought together by the crucial\nconcept of adaptive feedback control, which is a laboratory procedure employing\nmeasurement-driven, closed-loop optimization to identify the best shapes of\nfemtosecond laser control pulses for steering quantum dynamics towards the\ndesired objective. Optimization in adaptive feedback control experiments is\nguided by a learning algorithm, with stochastic methods proving to be\nespecially effective. Adaptive feedback control of quantum phenomena has found\nnumerous applications in many areas of the physical and chemical sciences, and\nthis paper reviews the extensive experiments. Other subjects discussed include\nquantum optimal control theory, quantum control landscapes, the role of\ntheoretical control designs in experimental realizations, and real-time quantum\nfeedback control.

Such\ncurrent-driven DW motion opens great opportunities toward next-generation\nmagnetic devices controlled by current instead of magnetic field. However, the\nnature of the current-driven DW motion--considered qualitatively different from\nmagnetic-field-driven DW motion--remains yet unclear mainly due to the\npainfully high operation current densities J_OP, which introduce uncontrollable\nexperimental artefacts with serious Joule heating. It is also crucial to reduce\nJ_OP for practical device operation. By use of metallic Pt/Co/Pt nanowires with\nperpendicular magnetic anisotropy, here we demonstrate DW motion at current\ndensities down to the range of 10^9 A/m^2--two orders smaller than existing\nreports. Surprisingly the current-driven motion exhibits a scaling behaviour\nidentical to the field-driven motion and thus, belongs to the same universality\nclass despite their qualitative differences. Moreover all DW motions driven by\neither current or field (or by both) collapse onto a single curve, signalling\nthe unification of the two driving mechanisms.

In the\ncorrelation method, the same resistor is connected to two amplifiers and a\ncorrelation of their outputs is performed, in order to reject amplifiers'\nnoise. Such rejection is not perfect: the residual correlation gives a\nsystematic error in the JNT reading. In order to put an upper limit, or to\nachieve a correction, for such error, a careful electrical modelling of the\namplifiers and connections must be performed. Standard numerical simulation\ntools are inadequate for such modelling. In literature, evaluations have been\nperformed by the painstaking solving of analytical modelling. We propose an\nevaluation procedure for the JNT error due to residual correlations which\nblends analytical and numerical approaches, with the benefits of both: a\nrigorous and accurate circuit noise modelling, and a fast and flexible\nevaluation with an user-friendly commercial tool. The method is applied to a\nsimple but very effective ultralow-noise amplifier employed in a working JNT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Dec 2009 10:11:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Nodes go through a cycle of introduction (conception or\n''birth'') with parents in the network and later exit from it (''death'').\nHence the phylogenetic tree is dynamic or possesses a genetic drift. Typical\nlifetimes of gene sets and number of offspring from different parents affect\nthis genetic drift and the level of correlation between gene sets. The\nfrequency of mutations similarly affects the gene pool. Correlation between\ngenes of the nodes implies a common secret for cryptographic material for\ncommunication and consistency check facilitating intrusion detection and\ntracing of events. A node can by itself (non-specifically) recognise an\nadversary if it does not respond properly according to its genes. Nodes can\nalso collaborate to recognise adversaries by communicating response from\nintruders to check for consistency with the whole gene pool (phylogenetic\ntree).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Dec 2009 12:59:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-31"}

Most of these galaxies are located around redshifts\nz=0.07 and z=0.11, but no clear connection in the form of a filamentary\nstructure is appreciable in between. While the galaxy distribution at z=0.07 is\nsparse, we find evidence at z=0.11 of a galaxy group or a low-mass galaxy\ncluster. We estimate that this structure could produce a tSZ effect of ~ -18\nmuK. The remaining VSA signal of ~ -212 muK is still a significant 4.1-sigma\ndeviation from the Gaussian CMB. However, the MITO error bar allows for a\nlarger tSZ effect, which could be produced by galaxy clusters or superclusters\nbeyond the sensitivity of the SDSS. Contributions from other possible secondary\nanisotropies associated with these structures are also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Dec 2009 13:15:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Although such interactions have been studied extensively for \"parallel\"\nwaves, whose wave vectors ${\\bf k}$ are aligned with the background magnetic\nfield ${\\bf B}_0$, much less is known about interactions between ions and\noblique A/IC waves, for which the angle $\\theta$ between ${\\bf k}$ and ${\\bf\nB}_0$ is nonzero. In this paper, we present new numerical results on resonant\ncyclotron interactions between protons and oblique A/IC waves in collisionless\nlow-beta plasmas such as the solar corona. We find that if some mechanism\ngenerates oblique high-frequency A/IC waves, then these waves initially modify\nthe proton distribution function in such a way that it becomes unstable to\nparallel waves. Parallel waves are then amplified to the point that they\ndominate the wave energy at the large parallel wave numbers at which the waves\nresonate with the particles. Pitch-angle scattering by these waves then causes\nthe plasma to evolve towards a state in which the proton distribution is\nconstant along a particular set of nested \"scattering surfaces\" in velocity\nspace, whose shapes have been calculated previously. As the distribution\nfunction approaches this state, the imaginary part of the frequency of parallel\nA/IC waves drops continuously towards zero, but oblique waves continue to\nundergo cyclotron damping while simultaneously causing protons to diffuse\nacross these kinetic shells to higher energies. We conclude that oblique A/IC\nwaves can be more effective at heating protons than parallel A/IC waves,\nbecause for oblique waves the plasma does not relax towards a state in which\nproton damping of oblique A/IC waves ceases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Dec 2009 15:49:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}
