Various instrumental systematics such as gain\nfluctuations, pixel rotation, differential gain, pointing, differential\nellipticity are also described by the same distortion model. All these\ndistortions produce B-mode that contaminate the primordial tensor B-modes\nsignal. In this paper we show that apart from generating B-modes, each\ndistortion uniquely couples different modes $(\\bfl_1\\ne \\bfl_2)$ of the CMB\nanisotropies, generating $<EB>$ correlations which for the primordial CMB are\nzero. We describe and implement unbiased minimum variance quadratic estimators\nwhich using the off diagonal correlations in the CMB can extract the map of\ndistortions.

Here we report electrical rectification in nanowires formed by\nnanoscale control of the metal-insulator transition at the interface between\nLaAlO3 and SrTiO3. Controlled in-plane asymmetry in the confinement potential\nproduces electrical rectification in the nanowire, analogous to what occurs\nnaturally for Schottky diodes or by design in structures with engineered\nstructural inversion asymmetry. Nanostructures produced in this manner may be\nuseful for electro-optic applications or in spintronic devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2009 16:01:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2010 21:43:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-12"}

Such observations provide a probe of the extreme conditions near\nthe solar atmosphere and photosphere and permit the study of the modulation of\ncosmic rays over the inner heliosphere. For the first year of Fermi\nobservations the solar modulation was at its minimum corresponding to a maximum\ncosmic-ray flux and, hence, maximum gamma-ray emission from the Sun. We discuss\nthe study of the quiescent solar emission, including spectral analysis of its\ntwo components, disk and inverse Compton, using the first-year data of the\nmission and models using the electron spectrum measured by Fermi.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2009 19:31:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-13"}

The collective intensity of a\ncosmological population emitting at very-high energies (VHE) will be attenuated\nat the highest energies through interactions with the EBL and enhanced at lower\nenergies by the resulting cascade. We calculate the cascade radiation created\nby VHE photons produced by blazars and investigate the effects of cascades on\nthe collective intensity of blazars and the resulting effects on the\nextragalactic gamma-ray background. We find that cascade radiation greatly\nenhances the collective intensity from blazars at high energies before turning\nover due to attenuation. The prominence of the resulting features depends on\nthe blazar gamma-ray luminosity function, spectral index distribution, and the\nmodel of the EBL. We additionally calculate the cascade radiation from the\ndistinct spectral sub-populations of blazars, BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs) and\nflat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), finding that the collective intensity of\nBL Lacs is considerably more enhanced by cascade radiation than that of the\nFSRQs due to their harder spectra. As such, studies of the blazar contribution\nto the EGRB by Fermi will have profound implications for the nature of the EBL,\nthe evolution of blazars, and blazar spectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2009 22:04:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-22"}

We investigate two mass regimes, i.e.,\n84 Msun and 671 Msun, using these two different energetics algorithms. The mass\nfunctions for the isothermal simulations and simulations which include dust\nheating are drastically different.

When solving this coupled system, the algebraic\nequations have to be solved at each grid point for each chemical species and at\neach time step. This leads to a coupled non-linear system. In this paper a\nglobal solution approach that enables to keep the software codes for transport\nand chemistry distinct is proposed. The method applies the Newton-Krylov\nframework to the formulation for reactive transport used in operator splitting.\nThe method is formulated in terms of total mobile and total fixed\nconcentrations and uses the chemical solver as a black box, as it only requires\nthat on be able to solve chemical equilibrium problems (and compute\nderivatives), without having to know the solution method. An additional\nadvantage of the Newton-Krylov method is that the Jacobian is only needed as an\noperator in a Jacobian matrix times vector product.

The main result of our studies is that the bolometric luminosity of\nZ CMa remained surprisingly constant during the recent \"outburst\". We conclude\nthat either the geometry of the cavity through which the light escapes from the\ncocoon has opened a new path, or that the screen of dust, which reflects the\nlight toward the observer became more efficient causing the observed increase\nof the visual brightness by about 2.5 magnitudes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Dec 2009 11:48:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

We propose here a\nHorvitz--Thompson estimator of the mean trajectory. In the context of a\nsuperpopulation framework, we prove under mild regularity conditions that we\nobtain uniformly consistent estimators of the mean function and of its variance\nfunction. With additional assumptions on the sampling design we state a\nfunctional Central Limit Theorem and deduce asymptotic confidence bands.\nStratified sampling is studied in detail, and we also obtain a functional\nversion of the usual optimal allocation rule considering a mean variance\ncriterion. These techniques are illustrated by means of a test population of\nN=18902 electricity meters for which we have individual electricity consumption\nmeasures every 30 minutes over one week.

The proposed methodology uses antibodies labeled with\norganically inert metals with a high atomic number. Irradiation using photons\nwith energies in the kilo--electron volt (keV) range show an increase in dose\ndue to a combination of an increase in photo-electric interactions and a\npronounced generation of Auger and/or Coster-Kronig (A-CK) electrons.\n  Methods: The dependency of the dose deposition on various factors is\ninvestigated using Monte Carlo simulation models. The factors investigated\ninclude: agent concentration, spectral dependency looking at mono--energetic\nsources as well as classical bremsstrahlung sources. The optimization of the\nenergy spectrum is performed in terms of physical dose enhancement as well as\nthe dose deposited by Auger and/or Coster-Kronig electrons and their biological\neffectiveness.\n  Results: A quasi-linear dependency on concentration and an exponential\ndecrease within the target medium is observed. The maximal dose enhancement is\ndependent on the position of the target in the beam. Apart from irradiation\nwith low photon energies (10 - 20 keV) there is no added benefit from the\nincrease in generation of Auger electrons. Interestingly, a regular 110kVp\nbremsstrahlung spectrum shows a comparable enhancement in comparison with the\noptimized mono--energetic sources.\n  Conclusions: In conclusion we find that the use of nano-particle enhanced\nshows promise to be implemented quite easily in regular clinic on a physical\nlevel due to the advantageous properties in classical beams.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Dec 2009 13:40:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-25"}
