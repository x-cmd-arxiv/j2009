The growing thin disks are\nmodeled as static gravitational potentials and we explore a variety of\ngrowing-disk parameters that are likely to influence the response of thick\ndisks. We find that the final thick-disk properties depend strongly on the\ntotal mass and radial scale-length of the growing thin disk, and much less\nsensitively on its growth timescale and vertical scale-height as well as the\ninitial sense of thick-disk rotation. Overall, the growth of an embedded thin\ndisk can cause a substantial contraction in both the radial and vertical\ndirection, resulting in a significant decrease in the scale-lengths and\nscale-heights of thick disks. Kinematically, a growing thin disk can induce a\nnotable increase in the mean rotation and velocity dispersions of thick-disk\nstars.

These events are relatively rare, but they potentially\ncontain unique information on the stellar atmosphere properties of their source\nstar, as shown in this study. Methods: Our dense photometric coverage of the\noverall light curve and a proper microlensing modelling allow us to derive\nmeasurements of the OGLE 2004-BLG-482 source star's linear limb-darkening\ncoefficients in three bands, including standard Johnson-Cousins I and R, as\nwell as in a broad clear filter.

This\ntime-dependent surface heating gives rise to fluid motions which propagate\nthroughout the planet. We investigate the ability of this \"thermal tide\" to\nproduce a quadrupole moment which can couple to the stellar gravitational tidal\nforce. While previous investigations discussed planets with solid surfaces,\nhere we focus on entirely fluid planets in order to understand gas giants with\nsmall cores. The Coriolis force, thermal diffusion and self-gravity of the\nperturbations are ignored for simplicity. First, we examine the response to\nthermal forcing through analytic solutions of the fluid equations which treat\nthe forcing frequency as a small parameter. In the \"equilibrium tide\" limit of\nzero frequency, fluid motion is present but does not induce a quadrupole\nmoment. In the next approximation, finite frequency corrections to the\nequilibrium tide do lead to a nonzero quadrupole moment, the sign of which\ntorques the planet {\\it away} from synchronous spin. We then numerically solve\nthe boundary value problem for the thermally forced, linear response of a\nplanet with neutrally stratified interior and stably stratified envelope.

Surprisingly, in the\nrange of forcing periods of 1-30 days, the induced quadrupole moments can be\nfar larger than the analytic result due to response of internal gravity waves\nwhich propagate in the radiative envelope.

The method is an extension of a\nstandard Bayesian procedure in the millimeter/submillimeter literature. As in\nthe standard method, the prior applied to source flux measurements is derived\nfrom an estimate of the source counts as a function of flux, dN/dS. The key\nfeature of the new method is that it enables reliable extraction of properties\nof individual sources, which previous methods in the literature do not. We\nfirst present the method for extracting individual source fluxes from data in a\nsingle observing band, then we extend the method to multiple bands, including\nprior information about the spectral behavior of the source population(s). The\nmulti-band estimation technique is particularly relevant for classifying\nindividual sources into populations according to their spectral behavior. We\nfind that proper treatment of the correlated prior information between\nobserving bands is key to avoiding significant biases in estimations of\nmulti-band fluxes and spectral behavior, biases which lead to significant\nnumbers of misclassified sources.

In a Newtonian fluid, it was shown\ntheoretically that such synchronization arises passively due to hydrodynamic\nforces between the two swimmers if their waveforms exhibit a front-back\ngeometrical asymmetry. Motivated by the fact that most biological fluids\npossess a polymeric microstructure, we address here synchronization in a\nviscoelastic fluid analytically. Using a two-dimensional infinite sheet model\nwe show that the presence of polymeric stresses removes the geometrical\nasymmetry constraint, and therefore even symmetric swimmers synchronize. Such\nsynchronization occurs on asymptotically faster time scales than in a Newtonian\nfluid, and the swimmers are seen to be driven into a stable in-phase\nconformation minimizing the energy dissipated in the surrounding fluid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2009 23:21:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-02"}

In cellular systems, the performance\nof limited feedback will be degraded in the presence of other cell\ninterference, when the base stations have limited or no coordination. This\npaper establishes the degradation in sum rate of users in a cellular system,\ndue to uncoordinated other cell interference and delay on the feedback channel.\nA goodput metric is defined as the rate when the bits are successfully received\nat the mobile station, and used to derive an upper bound on the performance of\nlimited feedback systems with delay. This paper shows that the goodput gained\nfrom having delayed limited feedback decreases doubly exponentially as the\ndelay increases. The analysis is extended to precoded spatial multiplexing\nsystems where it is shown that the same upper bound can be used to evaluate the\ndecay in the achievable sum rate. To reduce the effects of interference, zero\nforcing interference cancellation is applied at the receiver, where it is shown\nthat the effect of the interference on the achievable sum rate can be\nsuppressed by nulling out the interferer. Numerical results show that the decay\nrate of the goodput decreases when the codebook quantization size increases and\nwhen the doppler shift in the channel decreases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2009 23:40:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

For example, it has been\nindicated that the dynamical friction doesn't work in cored density profiles\n(constant density in the central region) despite that the Chandrasekhar formula\npredicts drag force even in the constant densities. In the former half of this\npaper, I discuss by N-body simulations that many-body interactions are also\nimportant in actual dynamical friction though derivation of the Chandrasekhar\nformula is based on the assumption of two-body interaction. In the simulation,\nthe many-body interactions are caused by a very small number of field particles\nco-rotating with a perturber. However, the contribution from the many-body\ninteractions accounts for a non-negligible fraction of the actual dynamical\nfriction. In the latter half, I discuss why the cored profiles suppress the\ndynamical friction. One possible explanation is that corrective effect of the\nmany-body interactions drive orbital motion of the perturber. The cessation of\ndynamical friction by this corrective effect would be feasible even in shallow\ncusp density profiles although the shallow cusp may evolve into a constant\ndensity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Dec 2009 10:11:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 May 2011 01:15:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

By this\nway, we classify clusters according to whether the set of edges inter- or\nintra-cluster edges are removable if wanting to keep the communication between\npairs of vertices in the same cluster. Also, we propose adaptive feedback\nalgorithms on the weights of the underlying graph, which can synchronize any\nbi-directed networks satisfying the two conditions above. We also give several\nnumerical examples to illustrate the theoretical results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Dec 2009 13:29:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The mass\nintegral provides a nonlinear control of the variables along the whole\nevolution. In this gauge, Einstein equations reduce to a coupled\nhyperbolic-elliptic system which is formally singular at the axis. As a first\nstep in analyzing this system of equations we study linear perturbations on\nflat background. We prove that the linear equations reduce to a very simple\nsystem of equations which provide, thought the mass formula, useful insight\ninto the structure of the full system. However, the singular behavior of the\ncoefficients at the axis makes the study of this linear system difficult from\nthe analytical point of view. In order to understand the behavior of the\nsolutions, we study the numerical evolution of them. We provide strong\nnumerical evidence that the system is well-posed and that its solutions have\nthe expected behavior. Finally, this linear system allows us to formulate a\nmodel problem which is physically interesting by itself, since it is connected\nwith the linear stability of black holes solutions in axial symmetry. This\nmodel can contribute significantly to solve the nonlinear problem and at the\nsame time it appears to be tractable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Dec 2009 14:50:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-06"}
