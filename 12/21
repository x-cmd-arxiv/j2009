One\ncrucial step is to determine the number of support points needed. Current tools\nhandle this on a case-by-case basis. Each combination of model, optimality\ncriterion and objective requires its own proof. The celebrated de la Garza\nPhenomenon states that under a (p-1)th-degree polynomial regression model, any\noptimal design can be based on at most p design points, the minimum number of\nsupport points such that all parameters are estimable. Does this conclusion\nalso hold for nonlinear models? If the answer is yes, it would be relatively\neasy to derive any optimal design, analytically or numerically. In this paper,\na novel approach is developed to address this question. Using this new\napproach, it can be easily shown that the de la Garza phenomenon exists for\nmany commonly studied nonlinear models, such as the Emax model, exponential\nmodel, three- and four-parameter log-linear models, Emax-PK1 model, as well as\nmany classical polynomial regression models. The proposed approach unifies and\nextends many well-known results in the optimal design literature. It has four\nadvantages over current tools: (i) it can be applied to many forms of nonlinear\nmodels; to continuous or discrete data; to data with homogeneous or\nnon-homogeneous errors; (ii) it can be applied to any design region; (iii) it\ncan be applied to multiple-stage optimal design; and (iv) it can be easily\nimplemented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2009 05:15:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-22"}

The maximum in Toomre's stability\ndiagram, which separates gravitationally stable and unstable states with\nrespect to axisymmetric perturbations, can be treated as a critical point for\nthis transition. Static perturbations of stellar density are explored and the\nmean perturbation amplitude is considered as the order parameter of the theory.\nThe disc's state is assumed to change as the disc passes through the critical\npoint. Since the disc tends to retain hydrostatic equilibrium, structures can\nbe formed spontaneously, identifiable with a seed spiral structure. A power-law\nscaling of the order parameter in the vicinity of the critical point has been\nfound. The susceptibility and other Landau--Weiss exponents similar to those in\nthe Van der Waals theory are calculated. The critical behaviour of marginally\nstable discs at the initial stage of their evolution occurs in numerical\nsimulations where snapshots of stellar positions reveal stellar splinters and\ncrescents diverging from the disc centre. These structures can be a result of\nthe phase transition. In numerical simulations, these structures eventually\nreduce to decaying worm-type features because of the `heating' most likely\nresulting from instability of stellar orbits due to resonances.

We observe that the monovalent\ncounterions originally condensed on a chain can be replaced by the multivalent\nones dissociated from the added salt due to strong electrostatic interaction.\nThese newly condensed ions give an important impact on the chain structure. At\nlow and at high salt concentrations, the conformation of a semiflexible chain\nis rodlike. The ion distributions show similarity to those for a rigid chain,\nbut difference to those for a flexible chain whose conformation is a coil. In\nthe mid-salt region, the flexible chain and the semiflexible chain collapse but\nthe collapsed chain structures are, respectively, disordered and ordered\nstructures. The ion distributions hence show different profiles for these three\nchain stiffness with the curves for the semiflexible chain lying between those\nfor the flexible and the rigid chains. The number of the condensed multivalent\ncounterions, as well as the effective chain charge, also shows similar\nbehavior, demonstrating a direct connection with the chain morphology.\nMoreover, we find that the condensed multivalent counterions form triplets with\ntwo adjacent monomers and are localized on the chain axis at intermediate salt\nconcentration when the chain stiffness is semiflexible or rigid.

The motivation behind this reformulation comes from the fact that for\nmany optimization problems we cannot evaluate exactly the objective function to\nbe optimized. Similarly, we may not be able to evaluate exactly the functions\ninvolved in iterative optimization algorithms. For example, we may only have\naccess to noisy measurements of the functions or statistical estimates provided\nthrough Monte Carlo sampling. This makes iterative optimization algorithms\nbehave like stochastic maps. Naive global optimization amounts to evolving a\ncollection of realizations of this stochastic map and picking the realization\nwith the best properties. This motivates the use of filtering techniques to\nallow focusing on realizations that are more promising than others. In\nparticular, we present a filtering reformulation of global optimization in\nterms of a special case of sequential importance sampling methods called\nparticle filters. The increasing popularity of particle filters is based on the\nsimplicity of their implementation and their flexibility. For parametric\nexponential density estimation problems, we utilize the flexibility of particle\nfilters to construct a stochastic global optimization algorithm which converges\nto the optimal solution appreciably faster than naive global optimization.\nSeveral examples are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2009 06:47:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-22"}

Two distinct and separate methods are\npresented.\n  Method 1: Alter the symbol set of the language by adding additional redundant\nsymbols for frequent symbols. This will reduce the high frequency of more\ncommonly used symbols. Hence, frequency analysis upon ciphertext will not be\npossible. Hence, decryption will be possible.\n  Method 2: Computers use binary base 2. Most encryption systems use ciphering\nto convert data to ciphertext. The author presents the theory and several\npossible implementations of a method for computers analogous to speaking\nanother language. This is done by using a binary base other than base 2. Ex.\nFibonacci, Phi or Prime.\n  In addition, steganography may be used for creating alternate binary bases.\n  This kind of encryption significantly increases the complexity of decryption.\nFirst the binary base must be known. Only then, can decryption begin.\n  This kind of encryption also breaks the transitivity of\nplaintext-codebook-binary; the correlation of letters-ASCII-base2. With this\ntransitivity broken, decryption is logically impossible. Coupled with\nencrypting the plaintext, binary encryption makes decryption uncrackable. It\nmay produce false positives--information theoretic secure, and requires much\nmore computing power to resolve than is currently used in brute force\ndecryption. Hence, the assertion that these combination of methods are\ncomputationally secure--impervious to brute force.\n  The proposed system has a drawback. It is not as compressed as a base2.\n(Similar to adding random padding to the encryption.) However, this is\nacceptable, since the goal is very strong encryption:\n  Both methods are not decryptable by method uncrackable - by conventional,\nstatistical means.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2009 04:56:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2009 01:32:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2012 01:08:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-05"}

Determining the mixing\nparameters by fitting data is by no means trivial. In order to extract the\nmixing parameters from the available processes where hadrons are involved,\ntheoretical evaluation of hadronic matrix elements is necessary. Therefore\nmodel-dependence is somehow unavoidable.

Several analytical methods to\ncalculate the trap DOS from the measured data were used to clarify, if the\ndifferent methods lead to comparable results. We also used computer simulations\nto further test the results from the analytical methods. Most methods predict a\ntrap DOS close to the valence band edge that can be very well approximated by a\nsingle exponential function with a slope in the range of 50-60 meV and a trap\ndensity at the valence band edge of approx. 2x10E21 eV-1cm-3. Interestingly,\nthe trap DOS is always slightly steeper than exponential. An important finding\nis that the choice of the method to calculate the trap DOS from the measured\ndata can have a considerable effect on the final result. We identify two\nspecific simplifying assumptions that lead to significant errors in the trap\nDOS. The temperature-dependence of the band mobility should generally not be\nneglected. Moreover, the assumption of a constant effective accumulation layer\nthickness leads to a significant underestimation of the slope of the trap DOS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2009 09:01:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-08"}

Nodes in these networks\nfrequently employ directional antennas to improve spatial throughput. In such\nnetworks, given a source and destination, it is of interest to compute an\noptimal path and channel assignment on every link in the path such that the\npath bandwidth is the same as that of the link bandwidth and such a path\nsatisfies the constraint that no two consecutive links on the path are assigned\nthe same channel, referred to as \"Channel Discontinuity Constraint\" (CDC).\nCDC-paths are also quite useful for TDMA system, where preferably every\nconsecutive links along a path are assigned different time slots.\n  This paper contains several contributions. We first present an $O(N^{2})$\ndistributed algorithm for discovering the shortest CDC-path between given\nsource and destination. This improves the running time of the $O(N^{3})$\ncentralized algorithm of Ahuja et al. for finding the minimum-weight CDC-path.\nOur second result is a generalized $t$-spanner for CDC-path; For any $\\theta>0$\nwe show how to construct a sub-network containing only $O(\\frac{N}{\\theta})$\nedges, such that that length of shortest CDC-paths between arbitrary sources\nand destinations increases by only a factor of at most\n$(1-2\\sin{\\tfrac{\\theta}{2}})^{-2}$. We propose a novel algorithm to compute\nthe spanner in a distributed manner using only $O(n\\log{n})$ messages. An\nimportant conclusion of this scheme is in the case of directional antennas are\nused. In this case, it is enough to consider only the two closest nodes in each\ncone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2009 09:34:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2010 19:36:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-26"}

The presence and level of magnetic activity\ndepend on stellar rotation, and rotation itself is strongly influenced by\nstrength and topology of the magnetic fields. Open clusters represent\nespecially useful targets to investigate the rotation/activity/age connection.\nThe open cluster M11 has been studied as a part of the RACE-OC project\n(Rotation and ACtivity Evolution in Open Clusters), which is aimed at exploring\nthe evolution of rotation and magnetic activity in the late-type members of\nopen clusters with different ages. Photometric observations of the open cluster\nM11 were carried out in June 2004 using LOAO 1m telescope. The rotation periods\nof the cluster members are determined by Fourier analysis of photometric data\ntime series. We further investigated the relations between the surface\nactivity, characterized by the light curve amplitude, and rotation. We have\ndiscovered a total of 75 periodic variables in the M11 FoV, of which 38 are\ncandidate cluster members. Specifically, among cluster members we discovered 6\nearly-type, 2 eclipsing binaries and 30 bona-fide single periodic late-type\nvariables. Considering the rotation periods of 16 G-type members of the almost\ncoeval 200-Myr M34 cluster, we could determine the rotation period distribution\nfrom a more numerous sample of 46 single G stars at an age of about 200-230 Myr\nand determine a median rotation period P=4.8d. A comparison with the younger\nM35 cluster (~150 Myr) and with the older M37 cluster (~550 Myr) shows that G\nstars rotate slower than younger M35 stars and faster than older M37 stars. The\nmeasured variation of the median rotation period is consistent with the\nscenario of rotational braking of main-sequence spotted stars as they age.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2009 10:46:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Newtonian dynamics\nwithout a dark matter halo provide a very poor fit to the rotation curve\nderived using the warp model. In the framework of modified Newtonian dynamic\nhowever the 21-cm rotation curve is well fitted by the gravitational potential\ntraced by the baryonic matter density alone. The inclusion of a dark matter\nhalo with a density profile as predicted by structure formation in a\nhierarchical clustering LambdaCDM cosmology makes the mass model in newtonian\ndynamic compatible with the rotation curve data. The dark halo concentration\nfor the best fit is C=12 and its total mass is 1.2 10^{12} Msun.

In this context most of previous studies\nneglected the effect of the obvious equilibrium flow along magnetic field\nlines. The flows are in general sub-Alfv\\'enic and hence comparatively slow.\nHere we investigate the effect of an equilibrium flow on the resonant\nabsorption of linear kink MHD waves in a cylindrical magnetic flux tube with\nthe aim of determining the changes in the frequency of the forward and backward\npropagating waves and in the modification of the damping times due to the flow.\nA loop model with both the density and the longitudinal flow changing in the\nradial direction is considered. We use the thin tube thin boundary (TTTB)\napproximation in order to calculate the damping rates. The full resistive\neigenvalue problem is also solved without assuming the TTTB approximation.\nUsing the small ratio of flow and Alfv\\'en speeds we derive simple analytical\nexpressions to the damping rate. The analytical expressions are in good\nagreement with the resistive eigenmode calculations. Under typical coronal\nconditions the effect of the flow on the damped kink oscillations is small when\nthe characteristic scale of the density layer is similar or smaller than the\ncharacteristic width of the velocity layer. However, in the opposite situation\nthe damping rates can be significantly altered, specially for the backward\npropagating wave which is undamped while the forward wave is overdamped.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2009 11:21:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The most crucial results are: (i) some short\nGRBs occur in elliptical galaxies; (ii) the majority of short GRBs occur in\nstar forming galaxies; (iii) the star forming hosts of short GRBs are distinct\nfrom the host galaxies of long GRBs in terms of star formation rates,\nluminosities, and metallicities, and instead appear to be drawn from the\ngeneral field galaxy population; (iv) the physical offsets of short GRBs\nrelative to their host galaxy centers are significantly larger than for long\nGRBs; (v) the observed offset distribution agrees well with predictions for the\nlocations of NS-NS binary mergers; and (vi) unlike long GRBs, which tend to\noccur in the brightest regions of their hosts, the environments of short GRBs\ngenerally under-represent the light distribution of their host galaxies.

The CephIIs in the general field of the LMC\nfollow this relation for periods shorter than about 20 days. At longer period\n(the region of the RV Tau stars), the LMC field stars have a significant\nscatter and in the mean are more luminous than the PL relation.

Infrared colours\nof stars in the RV Tau period range show marked mean differences between three\ngroupings; the Galactic field, the LMC field, and globular clusters.

About 60% of them are spectroscopically identified Type 1 AGN, while\nthe others have a reliable photometric redshift and are classified as Type 1\nAGN on the basis of their multi-band Spectral Energy Distributions. We discuss\nthe relationship between UV and X-ray luminosity, as parameterized by the\n$\\alphaox$ spectral slope, and its dependence on redshift and luminosity. We\ncompare our findings with previous investigations of optically selected\nbroad-line AGN (mostly from SDSS). A highly significant correlation between\n$\\alphaox$ and $\\lo$ is found, in agreement with previous investigations of\noptically selected samples. We calculate bolometric corrections, $\\kbol$, for\nthe whole sample using hard X-ray luminosities ($\\Lhard$), and the Eddington\nratios for a subsample of 150 objects for which black hole mass estimates are\navailable. We confirm the trend of increasing bolometric correction with\nincreasing Eddington ratio as proposed in previous works. A tight correlation\nis found between $\\alphaox$ and $\\kbol$, which can be used to estimate accurate\nbolometric corrections using only optical and X-ray data. We find a significant\ncorrelation between $\\alphaox$ and Eddington ratio, in which $\\alphaox$\nincreases for increasing Eddington ratios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2009 14:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

First, the Logic for Partial Function (LPF) used by VDM is\nextended to specify memory access using pointers and memory layout of composite\ntypes. Then, the concepts of data-retrieve functions (DRF) and memory-scope\nfunctions (MSF) are introduced in this paper. People can define DRFs to\nretrieve abstract values from interconnected concrete data objects. The\ndefinition of the corresponding MSF of a DRF can be derived syntactically from\nthe definition of the DRF. This MSF computes the set of memory units accessed\nwhen the DRF retrieves an abstract value. This memory unit set is called the\nmemory scope of the abstract value. Finally, the proof rule of assignment\nstatements in Hoare's logic is modified to deal with pointers. The basic idea\nis that a virtual value keeps unmodified as long as no memory unit in its scope\nis over-written. Another proof rule is added for memory allocation statements.\nThe consequence rule and the rules for control-flow statements are slightly\nmodified. They are essentially same as their original version in Hoare logic.\n  An example is presented to show the efficacy of this logic.

We then characterise the\nbounded operators on E(G/N) that commute to the left action of C*(G) as central\nmultipliers of C*(L) and interpret this result as a globalised generic\nirreducibility theorem. Finally, we establish the convergence of intertwining\nintegrals on a dense subset of E(G/N).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2009 15:26:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2011 13:24:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-22"}

In particular,\nthe maximum critical current achievable in high-Tc wires and tapes is well\nknown to be limited by the presence of grain boundaries, regions of mismatch\nbetween crystallites with misoriented crystalline axes. In studies of single,\nartificially fabricated grain boundaries the striking observation has been made\nthat the critical current Jc of a grain boundary junction depends exponentially\non the misorientation angle. Until now microscopic understanding of this\napparently universal behavior has been lacking. We present here the results of\na microscopic evaluation based on a construction of fully 3D YBCO grain\nboundaries by molecular dynamics. With these structures, we calculate an\neffective tight-binding Hamiltonian for the d-wave superconductor with a grain\nboundary. The critical current is then shown to follow an exponential\nsuppression with grain boundary angle. We identify the buildup of charge\ninhomogeneities as the dominant mechanism for the suppression of the\nsupercurrent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2009 15:38:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-07"}
