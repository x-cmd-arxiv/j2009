For the majority of these sources, the X-ray photometry is\nconsistent with thermal emission from plasma having temperatures in the range\nof kT=1-8 keV or non-thermal emission having power-law indices in the range of\n-1<gamma<3, and X-ray luminosities in the range of Lx~1e32-1e34 erg/s.

However, the possibility of intrinsic hard X-ray\ngeneration from single stars cannot be completely ruled out.

It will yield important information on the ages of the\npopulations. The observations will be combined with data from MACHO, OGLE,\nEROS, VST, Spitzer, HST, Chandra, INTEGRAL, WISE, Fermi LAT, XMM-Newton, GAIA\nand ALMA for a complete understanding of the variable sources in the inner\nMilky Way.

Our principal results, some of\nthem unexpected, are: (1) The high-excitation fluxes varied systematically and\nnon-trivially throughout eta Car's 5.5-year spectroscopic cycle. Instead of\nrising to a plateau after the 1998 \"event,\" they changed continuously with a\nmaximum in mid-cycle. (2) At one significant location a brief, strong secondary\nmaximum occurred just before the 2003.5 spectroscopic event. (3) These emission\nlines are strongly concentrated at the \"Weigelt knots\" several hundred AU\nnorthwest of the star. With less certainty, [Ne III] appears to be somewhat\nmore concentrated than [Fe III]. (4) A faster, blue-shifted component of each\nfeature appears concentrated near the star and elongated perpendicular to the\nsystem's bipolar axis. This structure may be related to the equatorial outflow\nand/or to dense material known to exist along our line of sight to the star.\n(5) Using the photoionization program Cloudy, we estimated the range of\nparameters for the hot secondary star that would give satisfactory\nhigh-excitation line ratios in the ejecta.

In this paper, however, we show that in detail the correspondence\nbetween galaxy morphology and color is not perfect, providing insight into the\nphysical origin of this evolution. Using the COSMOS survey, we study a\nsignificant population of red sequence galaxies with disk-like morphologies.\nThese passive disks typically have Sa-Sb morphological types with large bulges,\nbut they are not confined to dense environments. They represent nearly one-half\nof all red-sequence galaxies and dominate at lower masses (log Mstar < 10)\nwhere they are increasingly disk-dominated. As a function of time, the\nabundance of passive disks with log Mstar < 11 increases, but not as fast as\nred-sequence spheroidals in the same mass range. At higher mass, the passive\ndisk population has declined since z~1, likely because they transform into\nspheroidals. We estimate that as much as 60% of galaxies transitioning onto the\nred sequence evolve through a passive disk phase. The origin of passive disks\ntherefore has broad implications for understanding how star formation shuts\ndown. Because passive disks tend to be more bulge-dominated than their\nstar-forming counterparts, a simple fading of blue disks does not fully explain\ntheir origin. We explore several more sophisticated explanations, including\nenvironmental effects, internal stabilization, and disk regrowth during\ngas-rich mergers.

This classifier analysis is based on a Support\nVector Machine (SVM). Using a set of 12 moments of the radial intensity\nprofiles, the algorithm performs well in discriminating between the above three\ncategories of limb structures, with a misclassification rate of 7%.

The QDS is composed of\n\"relatively infinite\" u-quarks and d-quarks as well as electrons with negative\nenergy in the vacuum.

The gravity of the universe pulls on the quarks inside\nthe QDS. The pulling force becomes larger and larger as the universe shrinks\nand shrinks. Once the pulling force is larger than the binding force on the\nquarks by the whole QDS, a huge number of quarks and antiquarks will be excited\nout from the QDS.

The huge number of excited quark-antiquark pairs annihilate back to the\nQDS and release a huge amount of energy; these energies make the big bang.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Dec 2009 14:15:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-08"}

The observed ratio\nbetween the gyroscope and ring accelerations was 3+/-1.2x10^-8. Here, a new\nmodel for inertia which has been tested quite successfully on the Pioneer and\nflyby anomalies is applied to this problem. The model assumes that the inertia\nof the gyroscope is caused by Unruh radiation that appears as the ring and the\nfixed stars accelerate relative to it, and that this radiation is subject to a\nHubble-scale Casimir effect. The model predicts that the sudden acceleration of\nthe nearby ring causes a slight increase in the inertial mass of the gyroscope,\nand, to conserve momentum in the reference frame of the spinning Earth, the\ngyroscope rotates clockwise with an acceleration ratio of 1.8+/-0.25x10^-8 in\nagreement with the observed ratio. However, this model does not explain the\nparity violation seen in some of the gyroscope data. To test these ideas the\nTajmar experiment (setup B) could be exactly reproduced in the southern\nhemisphere, since the model predicts that the anomalous acceleration should\nthen be anticlockwise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Dec 2009 15:09:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-21"}
