The main idea hinges on the fact that\nwe can form tensors from the difference, C^a_bc, of the Levi-Civita connections\nof the two metrics, and these act like gravitational accelerations. In the\ncontext of MOND we can form dimensionless `acceleration' scalars, and functions\nthereof, from contractions of C^a_bc/a0. I look at a class of bimetric MOND\ntheories governed by an action with the gravitational Lagrangian density b\nsqrt(g)R+a sqrt(g*) R* -2(gg*)^{1/4}f(k)a0^2M(U/a0^2), and with matter actions\nI(g_mn,psi)+I*(g*_mn,chi), with U a scalar quadratic in the C^a_bc,\nk=(g/g*)^{1/4}, and allowing for the existence of twin matter, chi, that\ncouples to g*_mn alone. In particular, I concentrate on one interesting and\nsimple choice of the scalar U. This theory introduces only one new constant,\na0; it tends simply to General Relativity in the limit a0 goes to 0, and to a\nphenomenologically valid MOND theory in the nonrelativistic limit. The theory\nnaturally gives MOND and \"dark energy\" effects from the same term in the\naction, both controlled by the MOND constant a0. As regards gravitational\nlensing by nonrelativistic systems--a holy grail for relativistic MOND\ntheories--the theory predicts that the same potential that controls\nmassive-particle motion also dictates lensing in the same way as in GR. This\nlast result can be modified with other choices of U, but lensing is still\nenhanced and MOND-like, with an effective logarithmic potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2009 16:18:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2010 11:51:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-05"}

However, observations\nshow that the strength of magnetic field in the GC is much higher than in other\nparts of the Galaxy, and it may range there from 100 $\\mu$G to several mG. In\nthese conditions, synchrotron losses of positrons are significant that extends\nthe range of acceptable values of positron injection energy. We show that if\npositrons injection in the GC is non-stationary and magnetic field is higher\nthan 0.4 mG both radio and gamma-ray restrictions permit their energy to be\nhigher than several GeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2009 16:35:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The individual scores are then averaged over forecast cases, to result\nin a summary measure of the predictive performance, such as the mean absolute\nerror or the (root) mean squared error. I demonstrate that this common practice\ncan lead to grossly misguided inferences, unless the scoring function and the\nforecasting task are carefully matched.\n  Effective point forecasting requires that the scoring function be specified\nex ante, or that the forecaster receives a directive in the form of a\nstatistical functional, such as the mean or a quantile of the predictive\ndistribution. If the scoring function is specified ex ante, the forecaster can\nissue the optimal point forecast, namely, the Bayes rule. If the forecaster\nreceives a directive in the form of a functional, it is critical that the\nscoring function be consistent for it, in the sense that the expected score is\nminimized when following the directive.\n  A functional is elicitable if there exists a scoring function that is\nstrictly consistent for it. Expectations, ratios of expectations and quantiles\nare elicitable. For example, a scoring function is consistent for the mean\nfunctional if and only if it is a Bregman function. It is consistent for a\nquantile if and only if it is generalized piecewise linear. Similar\ncharacterizations apply to ratios of expectations and to expectiles. Weighted\nscoring functions are consistent for functionals that adapt to the weighting in\npeculiar ways.

In our\nmodel, an optically thick disk in the BH equatorial plane produces thermal seed\nphotons with polarization oriented parallel to the disk surface. These seed\nphotons are then inverse-Compton scattered through a hot (but thermal) corona,\nproducing a hard X-ray power-law spectrum. We consider three different models\nfor the corona geometry: a wedge ``sandwich'' with aspect ratio H/R and\nvertically-integrated optical depth tau_0 constant throughout the disk; an\ninhomogeneous ``clumpy'' corona with a finite number of hot clouds distributed\nrandomly above the disk within a wedge geometry; and a spherical corona of\nuniform density, centered on the BH and surrounded by a truncated thermal disk\nwith inner radius R_edge. In all cases we find a characteristic transition from\nhorizontal polarization at low energies to vertical polarization above the\nthermal peak; the vertical direction is defined as the projection of the BH\nspin axis on the plane of the sky. We show how the details of the\nspectropolarization signal can be used to distinguish between these models and\ninfer various properties of the corona and BH. Although the bulk of this paper\nfocuses on stellar-mass BHs, we also consider the effects of coronal scattering\non the X-ray polarization signal from supermassive BHs in active galactic\nnuclei.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2009 17:44:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

We\ndiscuss the potential of space missions like Kepler and CoRoT, designed to\ndiscover transiting exo-planets, to detect Oort Cloud, Kuiper Belt and main\nbelt objects by occultations of background stars. Relying on published\ndynamical estimates of the content of the Oort Cloud, we find that Kepler's\nmain program is expected to detect between 0 and ~100 occultation events by\ndeca-kilometer-sized Oort Cloud objects. The occultations rate depends on the\nmass of the Oort cloud, the distance to its \"inner edge\", and the size\ndistribution of its objects. In contrast, Kepler is unlikely to find\noccultations by Kuiper Belt or main belt asteroids, mainly due to the fact that\nit is observing a high ecliptic latitude field. Occultations by Solar System\nobjects will appear as a photometric deviation in a single measurement,\nimplying that the information regarding the time scale and light-curve shape of\neach event is lost. We present statistical methods that have the potential to\nverify the authenticity of occultation events by Solar System objects, to\nestimate the distance to the occulting population, and to constrain their size\ndistribution.

Conventional cooperation techniques require sharing large\namounts of information over finite-capacity backhaul links and assume that base\nstations have full channel state information (CSI) of all the active users in\nthe system. In this paper, a new limited feedback strategy is proposed for\nmulticell beamforming where cooperation is restricted to sharing only the CSI\nof active users among base stations. The system setup considered is a linear\narray of cells based on the Wyner model. Each cell contains single-antenna\nusers and multi-antenna base stations. Closed-form expressions for the\nbeamforming vectors that approximately maximize the sum-rates in a multicell\nsystem are first presented, assuming full CSI at the transmitter. For the more\npractical case of a finite-bandwidth feedback link, CSI of the desired and\ninterfering channels is quantized at the receiver before being fed back to the\nbase station. An upper bound on the mean loss in sum rate due to random vector\nquantization is derived. A new feedback-bit allocation strategy, to partition\nthe available bits between the desired and interfering channels, is developed\nto approximately minimize the mean loss in sum-rate due to quantization. The\nproposed feedback-bit partitioning algorithm is shown, using simulations, to\nyield sum-rates close to the those obtained using full CSI at base stations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2009 23:57:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-08"}

Many of\nthese studies rely on the horseshoe drag, whose long term-evolution (saturated\nor not) is intimately related to the disk viscosity in laminar disk models.

At\nlow-turbulence, the running-time averaged torque is in good agreement with the\ntotal torque obtained for an equivalent laminar model, with a similar\nvortensity's diffusion coefficient.

I analyze all available TRACE observing\nsequences between 1998/04/01 and 2009/09/30 with full-resolution 171A image\nsequences spanning a day or more within 500 arcsec of disk center, observing\nessentially quiet Sun with good exposures and relatively low background. Ten\nsuch data sets are identified between 2000 and 2008, spanning 570h of observing\nwith a total of 17133 exposures. Eighty small-scale coronal eruptions are\nidentified. Their size distribution forms a smooth extension of the\ndistribution of angular widths of coronal mass ejections, suggesting that the\neruption frequency for bipolar magnetic regions is essentially scale free over\nat least two orders of magnitude, from eruptions near the arcsecond resolution\nlimit of TRACE to the largest coronal mass ejections observed in the inner\nheliosphere. This scale range may be associated with the properties of the\nnested set of ranges of connectivity in the magnetic field, in which\nincreasingly large and energetic events can reach higher and higher into the\ncorona until the heliosphere is reached.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Dec 2009 02:38:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}
