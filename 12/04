Here we demonstrate that a combination of carbon nanotubes with\na photonic metamaterial offers a new paradigm for the development of nonlinear\nmedia with exceptionally strong ultrafast nonlinear response invaluable in\nphotonic applications. It is underpinned by strong coupling between weakly\nradiating Fano-type resonant plasmonic modes and the excitonic response of\nsingle-walled semiconductor carbon nanotubes. Using a \"combinatorial\" approach\nto material discovery we show that the optical response of such a composite\nsystem can be tailored and optimized by metamaterial design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2009 17:31:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-03"}

To exemplify this, we dilute an out-of-equilibrium fluid flowing\nthrough random media with a marker, which can be observed in an experiment.

Two types of statistical\nestimators for the structure of the underlying media are then constructed: a\nlinear estimator provides unbiased and asymptotically precise information on\nthe particle density profiles, but yields negative estimates for the effective\nresistances of the media in some cases.

Several disparate lensing\nmodels agree on: (1) reproducing accurately the observed image positions; (2)\npredicting a nearly axisymmetric total mass distribution, centered and oriented\nas the light distribution; (3) measuring a value of 8.11 x 10^{10} M_{Sun} for\nthe total mass projected within the Einstein radius of 2.5 kpc; (4) estimating\na total mass density profile slightly steeper than an isothermal one.

The escort\nprobability is interpreted as the coupled probability, with Q = 1 - q defined\nas the degree of nonlinear coupling between the statistical states. Positive\nvalues of Q have coupled statistical states, a larger entropy metric, and a\nmaximum coupled-entropy distribution of compact-support coupled-Gaussians.\nNegative values of Q have decoupled statistical states and for -2 < Q < 0 a\nmaximum coupled-entropy distribution of heavy-tail coupled-Gaussians. The\nconjugate transformation between the heavy-tail and compact-support domains is\nshown to be -2Q/(2+Q) for coupled-Gaussian distributions. This conjugate\nrelationship has been used to extend the generalized Fourier transform to the\ncompact-support domain and to define a scale-invariant correlation structure\nwith heavy-tail limit distribution. In the present paper, we show that the\nconjugate is a mapping between the source of nonlinearity in non-stationary\nstochastic processes and the nonlinear coupling which defines the\ncoupled-Gaussian limit distribution. The effects of additive and multiplicative\nnoise are shown to be separable into the coupled-variance and the coupling\nparameter Q, providing further evidence of the importance of the generalized\nmoments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2009 23:19:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

This emission feature closely resembles\nB1822-09's precursor which also occurs brightly in only one mode. B0943+10's\nother mode is well known for its highly regular drifting subpulses that are\napparently produced by a rotating carousel system of 20 beamlets.

We survey our 18 hours of B0943+10 observations and find\nthat the sideband-modulation features, from which the carousel-rotation time\ncan be directly determined, occur rarely--less than 5% of the time--but always\nindicating 20 beamlets.

In agreement with other authors, we find\nthat thermohaline mixing substantially reduces the abundance of helium-3 on the\nupper part of the red giant branch in our lowest mass model. However, the small\namount of helium-3 that remains is enough to drive thermohaline mixing on the\nAGB. We find that thermohaline mixing is most efficient in the early thermal\npulses and its efficiency drops from pulse to pulse. Nitrogen is not\nsubstantially affected by the process, but we do see substantial changes in\ncarbon-13. The carbon-12 to carbon-13 ratio is substantially lowered during the\nearly thermal pulses but the efficacy of the process is seen to diminish\nrapidly. As the process stops after a few pulses, the carbon-12 to carbon-13\nratio is still able to reach values of 10^3-10^4, which is inconsistent with\nthe values measured in carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars. We also note a\nsurprising increase in the lithium-7 abundance, with log epsilon(Li-7) reaching\nvalues of over 2.5 in the 1.5 solar mass model. It is thus possible to get\nstars which are both C- and Li-rich at the same time.

Our motivation was to cast the training of a classifier\ninto a format amenable to solution by the quantum adiabatic algorithm. Applying\nadiabatic quantum computing (AQC) promises to yield solutions that are superior\nto those which can be achieved with classical heuristic solvers. Interestingly\nwe found that by using heuristic solvers to obtain approximate solutions we\ncould already gain an advantage over the standard method AdaBoost. In this\ncommunication we generalize the baseline method to large scale classifier\ntraining. By large scale we mean that either the cardinality of the dictionary\nof candidate weak classifiers or the number of weak learners used in the strong\nclassifier exceed the number of variables that can be handled effectively in a\nsingle global optimization. For such situations we propose an iterative and\npiecewise approach in which a subset of weak classifiers is selected in each\niteration via global optimization. The strong classifier is then constructed by\nconcatenating the subsets of weak classifiers. We show in numerical studies\nthat the generalized method again successfully competes with AdaBoost. We also\nprovide theoretical arguments as to why the proposed optimization method, which\ndoes not only minimize the empirical loss but also adds L0-norm regularization,\nis superior to versions of boosting that only minimize the empirical loss. By\nconducting a Quantum Monte Carlo simulation we gather evidence that the quantum\nadiabatic algorithm is able to handle a generic training problem efficiently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2009 06:30:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-07"}

The\npresent time is where this transition largely takes place, but the process does\nnot take place uniformly: Evidence from delayed choice and related experiments\nshows that isolated patches of quantum indeterminacy remain, and that their\ntransition from probability to certainty only takes place later. Thus, when\nquantum effects are significant, the picture of a classical Evolving Block\nUniverse (`EBU') cedes place to one of a Crystallizing Block Universe (`CBU'),\nwhich reflects this quantum transition from indeterminacy to certainty, while\nnevertheless resembling the EBU on large enough scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2009 10:10:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-17"}

The orientation of the graphene lattice changes from one island to the\nother. In the STM images, this rotational disorder gives rise to various\nsuperlattices with periods in the nm range.

This maximum is due to the reduced efficiency of Ekman pumping when Pr\nbecomes too small or too large. When Pr becomes small, i.e. for large thermal\ndiffusivity, the heat that is carried by the vertical vortices spreads out in\nthe middle of the cell, and Ekman pumping thus becomes less efficient.

We discuss the validity of\nthe different tracers in different star formation scenarios and compare our\npredictions with previous calibrations of general use.

However, recent numerical simulations suggested\nthat the transition to this regime is accompanied by a sudden \"burst\" of\nacceleration. We confirm this finding and attribute the acceleration to the\nsideways expansion of the jet - the magnetic energy is converted into the\nkinetic one in the strong magnetosonic rarefaction wave, which is launched when\nthe jet loses its external support. This type of acceleration, the rarefaction\nacceleration, is specific to relativistic jets because their energy budget can\nstill be dominated by magnetic energy even in highly super-fast magnetosonic\nregime. Just like the collimation acceleration of externally confined\nmagnetized jets, it is connected with the geometry of magnetic flux sufaces. In\nboth cases, in the acceleration zone the poloidal field lines diverge faster\nthan in the monopolar configuration.

Instead, the maximal flux\nstate is invariably asymmetric either being a `side-by-side' configuration\nwhere Gamma starts and finishes at the tube wall or an eccentric core-annular\nflow where Gamma is an off-centre full circle in which the more viscous fluid\nis surrounded by the less viscous fluid.
