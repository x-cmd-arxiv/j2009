At least naively, one would expect papers with more authors\nto be cited more. I test this expectation with the same sample of papers as\nanalyzed in Stanek (2008), selecting all (~30,000) refereed papers from A&A,\nAJ, ApJ and MNRAS published between 2000 and 2004. (...) I find that indeed\npapers with more authors are on average cited more, but only weakly so:\nroughly, the number of citations doubles with ten-fold increase in the number\nof authors. While the median number of citations to a 2 author paper is 17, the\nmedian number of citations to a paper with 10 to 20 authors is 32. I find that\nmost of the papers are written by a small number of authors, with a mode of 2\nauthors and a median of 3 authors. I also find that papers with more authors\nare not longer than papers with fewer authors, in fact a median number of 8 to\n10 pages per paper holds for any number of authors. For the same sample of\npapers, a median number of citations per paper grew from 15 in June 2008\n(Stanek 2008) to 19 in November 2009.

Milosavljevic & Phinney (2005) proposed that a circumbinary disk\naround a binary of mass ~10^6 Msol will emit an accretion-powered X-ray\nafterglow approximately one decade after the gravitational wave event. We\nrevisit this scenario by using Green's function solutions to calculate the\ntemporal viscous evolution and the corresponding electromagnetic signature of\nthe circumbinary disk. Our calculations suggest that an electromagnetic\ncounterpart may become observable as a rapidly brightening source soon after\nthe merger, i.e. several years earlier than previously thought. The afterglow\ncan reach super-Eddington luminosities without violating the local Eddington\nflux limit. It is emitted in the soft X-ray by the innermost circumbinary disk,\nbut it may be partially reprocessed at optical and infrared frequencies. We\nalso find that the spreading disk becomes increasingly geometrically thick\nclose to the central object as it evolves, indicating that the innermost flow\ncould become advective and radiatively inefficient, and generate a powerful\noutflow. We conclude that the mergers of massive black holes detected by LISA\noffer unique opportunities for monitoring on humanly tractable timescales the\nviscous evolution of accretion flows and the emergence of outflows around\nmassive black holes with precisely known masses, spins and orientations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 2009 17:16:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2009 20:26:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 17 Mar 2010 00:22:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

Since 2004 gravitational microlensing has been successfully\napplied as a detection method for extrasolar planets. In principle, the method\nis sensitive to masses as low as an Earth mass or even a fraction of it. Hence\nit seems natural to investigate the microlensing effects of moons around\nextrasolar planets. We explore the simplest conceivable triple lens system,\ncontaining one star, one planet and one moon. From a microlensing point of\nview, this system can be modelled as a particular triple with hierarchical mass\nratios very different from unity. Since the moon orbits the planet, the\nplanet-moon separation will be small compared to the distance between planet\nand star. Such a configuration can lead to a complex interference of caustics.\nWe present detectability and detection limits by comparing triple-lens light\ncurves to best-fit binary light curves as caused by a double-lens system\nconsisting of host star and planet -- without moon. We simulate magnification\npatterns covering a range of mass and separation values using the inverse ray\nshooting technique. These patterns are processed by analysing a large number of\nlight curves and fitting a binary case to each of them. A chi-squared criterion\nis used to quantify the detectability of the moon in a number of selected\ntriple-lens scenarios. The results of our simulations indicate that it is\nfeasible to discover extrasolar moons via gravitational microlensing through\nfrequent and highly precise monitoring of anomalous Galactic microlensing\nevents with dwarf source stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 2009 20:43:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 10 Oct 2010 17:02:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

While Boolean mechanisms do not provide\ninformation about exact concentration rates or time scales, they are often\nsufficient to capture steady states and other key dynamics.

In particular, it is shown that motives\nwith rational coefficients satisfy the formalism of the six operations of\nGrothendieck. This is achieved by studying descent properties of motives, as\nwell as by comparing different presentations of these categories, following and\nextending insights and constructions of Deligne, Beilinson, Bloch, Thomason,\nGabber, Levine, Morel, Voevodsky, Ayoub, Spitzweck, R\\\"ondigs, {\\O}stv{\\ae}r,\nand others. In particular, the relation of motives with $K$-theory is addressed\nin full, and we prove the absolute purity theorem with rational coefficients,\nusing Quillen's localization theorem in algebraic $K$-theory together with a\nvariation on the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem. Using resolution of\nsingularities via alterations of de Jong-Gabber, this leads to a version of\nGrothendieck-Verdier duality for constructible motivic sheaves with rational\ncoefficients over rather general base schemes.

It is possible,\nbut unlikely, that all UHECRs originate in the nearby radiogalaxy CenA. For\nlight UHECRs about a third of UHECRs can be \"matched\" to nearby galaxies with\nextended radio jets. The remaining UHECRs could also be explained as\noriginating in extended radiogalaxies if one has at least one of: a large UHECR\nmean free path, a high cluster and/or intergalactic magnetic field, a heavy\ncomposition for two-thirds of the detected UHECRs. Several UHECRs have\ntrajectories which pass close to Galactic magnetars and/or microquasars.\n  If extended radiogalaxies are, or trace, UHECR sources, the most consistent\nmodels for the ordered GMF are the BS-S and BS-A models; the GMF models of Sun\net al. 2008 are acceptable if a dipole component is added.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2009 00:30:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

We also analyze\nSpitzer observations of the same target in the infrared, obtaining secondary\neclipse depths of 0.098+/-0.017%, 0.159+/-0.022%, 0.245+/-0.031% and\n0.225+/-0.052% in the 3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and 8.0 micron IRAC bands respectively. We\ncombine these measurements with the recently published Kepler secondary eclipse\nmeasurement, and generate atmospheric models for the day-side of the planet\nthat are consistent with both the optical and infrared measurements. The data\nare best fit by models with a temperature inversion, as expected from the high\nincident flux.

Here we construct representatives of topological\ninsulators and superconductors for all five classes and in arbitrary spatial\ndimension d, in terms of Dirac Hamiltonians.

The\nsteep decline of SFR from z~2 to the present, at fixed M_star, is a consequence\nof the following: First, disk galaxies are in a steady state with the SFR\nfollowing the net (i.e., inflow minus outflow) gas accretion rate. The\nevolution of the SFR sequence is determined by evolution in the cosmological\nspecific accretion rates, \\propto (1+z)^{2.25}, but is found to be independent\nof feedback. Although feedback determines the outflow rates, it shifts galaxies\nalong the SFR sequence, leaving its zero point invariant. Second, the\nconversion of accretion rate to SFR is materialized through gas density, not\ngas mass. Although the model SFR is an increasing function of both gas mass\nfraction and gas density, only the gas densities are predicted to evolve\nsignificantly with redshift. Third, star formation is fueled by molecular gas.\nSince the molecular gas fraction increases monotonically with increasing gas\ndensity, the model predicts strong evolution in the molecular gas fractions,\nincreasing by an order of magnitude from z=0 to z~2. On the other hand, the\nmodel predicts that the effective surface density of atomic gas is ~10 M_sun\npc^{-2}, independent of redshift, stellar mass or feedback. Our model suggests\nthat the scatter in the SFR sequence reflects variations in the gas accretion\nhistory, and thus is insensitive to stellar mass, redshift or feedback. The\nlarge scatter in halo spin contributes negligibly, because it scatters galaxies\nalong the SFR sequence.

One of the most vexed security threat is node capture. A few solutions\nhave already been proposed to address this problem; however, those solutions\nare either centralized or focused on theoretical mobility models alone. In the\nformer case the solution does not fit well the distributed nature of the\nnetwork while, in the latter case, the quality of the solutions obtained for\nrealistic mobility models severely differs from the results obtained for\ntheoretical models. The rationale of this paper is inspired by the observation\nthat re-encounters of mobile nodes do elicit a form of social ties. Leveraging\nthese ties, it is possible to design efficient and distributed algorithms that,\nwith a moderated degree of node cooperation, enforce the emergent property of\nnode capture detection. In particular, in this paper we provide a proof of\nconcept proposing a set of algorithms that leverage, to different extent, node\nmobility and node cooperation--that is, identifying social ties--to thwart node\ncapture attack. In particular, we test these algorithms on a realistic mobility\nscenario. Extensive simulations show the quality of the proposed solutions and,\nmore important, the viability of the proposed approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2009 11:05:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}

Because of its five outer\nelectrons, this element shows a high density of energy levels leading to an\nextremely line-rich excitation spectrum with more than 25000 known spectral\nlines ranging from the UV to the infrared. We demonstrate the active frequency\nstabilization of a diode laser on several praseodymium lines between 1105 and\n1123 nm. The excitation signals were recorded in a hollow cathode lamp and\nobserved via laser-induced fluorescence. These signals are strong enough to\nlock the diode laser onto most of the lines by using standard laser locking\ntechniques. In this way, the frequency drifts of the unlocked laser of more\nthan 30 MHz/h were eliminated and the laser frequency stabilized to within\n1.4(1) MHz for averaging times >0.2 s. Frequency quadrupling the stabilized\ndiode laser can produce frequency-stable UV-light in the range from 276 to 281\nnm.
