First, we apply the weighted scaling index method (WSIM) to\ncharacterize the X-ray variability properties of 4U1543-47 in different\nspectral states during the 2002 outburst. Second, we use surrogate data to\ninvestigate whether the variability is nonlinear in any of the different\nspectral states. The main findings can be summarized as follows. The mean\nweighted scaling index appears to be able to parametrize uniquely the temporal\nvariability properties of this GBH: the 3 different spectral states of the 2002\noutburst of 4U1543-47 are characterized by different and well constrained\nvalues. The search for nonlinearity reveals that the variability is linear in\nall light curves with the notable exception of the very high state. Our results\nimply that we can use the WSIM to assign a single number, namely the mean\nweighted scaling index, to a light curve, and in this way discriminate among\nthe different spectral states of a source. The detection of nonlinearity in the\nVHS, that is characterized by the presence of most prominent QPOs, suggests\nthat intrinsically linear models which have been proposed to account for the\nlow frequency QPOs in GBHs may be ruled out (abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2009 16:01:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

With the\nhelp of three-dimensional high resolution hydrodynamical simulations with the\nPluto code, we follow the evolution of such clusters, focusing on stellar mass\nloss. This leads to clumpy or filamentary inflow of gas on large scales (tens\nof parsec), whereas a turbulent and very dense disc builds up on the parsec\nscale. In order to capture the relevant physics in the inner region, we treat\nthis disc separately by viscously evolving the radial surface density\ndistribution. This enables us to link the tens of parsec scale region\n(accessible via SINFONI observations) to the (sub-)parsec scale region\n(observable with the MIDI instrument and via water maser emission). In this\nwork, we concentrate on the effects of a parametrised turbulent viscosity to\ngenerate angular momentum and mass transfer in the disc and additionally take\nstar formation into account.

The existence of this metal\nskin leads to theoretical explanation of experimental data on the excitation of\nelectromagnetic surface shape resonances in lamellar metallic gratings by light\nin the visible to near-infrared range. Surface polaritons have been observed in\nreflection modes on metallized gratings where the electric field is highly\nlocalized inside the grooves (around 300-1000 times larger than intensity of\nincoming optical light). Here we present quantized Maxwell's equations for\nelectromagnetic field in an isotropic homogeneous medium, allowing us to solve\nthe absorption anomaly property of these metal films. The results imply the\nexistence of light boson particles with spin one and effective mass $m=\n2.5\\cdot 10^{-5} m_e$.

It is well-known that the sample autocovariance,\nbeing based on moments, does not have this property. Hence, the use of an\nautocovariance estimator which is robust to additive outliers can be very\nuseful for time-series modeling. In this paper, the asymptotic properties of\nthe robust scale and autocovariance estimators proposed by Rousseeuw and Croux\n(1993) and Genton and Ma (2000) are established for Gaussian processes, with\neither short-range or long-range dependence. It is shown in the short-range\ndependence setting that this robust estimator is asymptotically normal at the\nrate $\\sqrt{n}$, where $n$ is the number of observations. An explicit\nexpression of the asymptotic variance is also given and compared to the\nasymptotic variance of the classical autocovariance estimator. In the\nlong-range dependence setting, the limiting distribution displays the same\nbehavior than that of the classical autocovariance estimator, with a Gaussian\nlimit and rate $\\sqrt{n}$ when the Hurst parameter $H$ is less 3/4 and with a\nnon-Gaussian limit (belonging to the second Wiener chaos) with rate depending\non the Hurst parameter when $H \\in (3/4,1)$. Some Monte-Carlo experiments are\npresented to illustrate our claims and the Nile River data is analyzed as an\napplication. The theoretical results and the empirical evidence strongly\nsuggest using the robust estimators as an alternative to estimate the\ndependence structure of Gaussian processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2009 16:52:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-24"}

Weak\nK, Na, and FeH features as well as strong VO absorption in the integrated-light\nJ-band spectrum indicate a young age for the system. From spatially resolved\nK-band spectra we determine spectral types of L3 and L5 for components A and B,\nrespectively. SDSS J2249+0044A is spectrally very similar to G196-3B, an L3\ncompanion to a young M2.5 field dwarf. Thus, we adopt 100 Myr (the age estimate\nof the G196-3 system) as the age of SDSS J2249+0044AB, but ages of 12-790 Myr\nare possible. By comparison to G196-3B, we estimate a distance to SDSS\nJ2249+0044AB of 54 +- 16 pc and infer a projected separation of 17 +- 5 AU for\nthe binary. Comparison of the luminosities to evolutionary models at an age of\n100 Myr yields masses of 0.029 and 0.022 Msun for SDSS J2249+0044A and B,\nrespectively. Over the possible ages of the system (12-790 Myr), the mass of\nSDSS J2249+0044A could range from 0.011 to 0.070 Msun and the mass of SDSS\nJ2249+0044B could range from 0.009 to 0.065 Msun. Evolutionary models predict\nthat either component could be burning deuterium, which could result in a mass\nratio as low as 0.4, or alternatively, a reversal in the luminosities of the\nbinary.

The photometric distance to GSC 00568-01752 is 53 +- 15 pc, in agreement\nwith our distance estimate for SDSS J2249+0044AB.

Conventional population genetics models\ncould not fully resolve this controversy because they are based on certain\nassumptions about fitness landscape.

We found\nthat both pleiotropy and second order selection play a crucial role at\ndifferent stages of adaptation: the supply of mutators is provided through\ndestabilization of error correction complexes or fluctuations of production\nlevels of prototypic mismatch repair proteins (pleiotropic effects), while rise\nand fixation of mutators occur when there is a sufficient supply of beneficial\nmutations in replication-controlling genes. This general mechanism assures a\nrobust and reliable adaptation of organisms to unforeseen challenges.

Numerical studies which include radiative cooling typically\nadopt the 100--200 cells per clump radius resolution.

We find\nthat a contraction (expansion) of the medium that may be brought about by,\ne.g., applied stress leads to a higher (lower) transition temperature as\ncompared to the unstrained medium. In addition, we investigate edge\ndislocations and illustrate that the local transition temperature may be\nincreased in the immediate vicinity of the dislocation core. Our analysis is\nnot limited to supersolidity. Similar strain effects should also play a role in\nsuperconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Dec 2009 05:03:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Dec 2009 19:49:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2011 17:22:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-03"}

AMICA\nv-band data were calibrated to radiance using in-flight stellar observations.\nThe other band data were calibrated to reflectance by comparing them to\nground-based observations to avoid the uncertainty of the solar irradiation in\nthose bands. We found that the AMICA signal was linear with respect to the\ninput signal to an accuracy of << 1% when the signal level was < 3800 DN. We\nverified that the absolute radiance calibration of the AMICA v-band (0.55\nmicron) was accurate to 4% or less, the accuracy of the disk-integrated spectra\nwith respect to the AMICA v-band was about 1%, and the pixel-to-pixel\nresponsivity (flatfield) variation was 3% or less.

First, while all previous works consider a problem where each\nreservoir can transfer water to only one fixed reservoir, we consider a\nmulti-connection network being constructed in Thailand in which each reservoir\ncan transfer water to many reservoirs in one period of time. Second, a\ndemand-supply plan considered here is static, in contrast to a dynamic policy\nconsidered in previous works. Moreover, in order to efficiently develop a\nlong-term static plan, a severe loss (a risk) is taken into account, i.e. a\nrisk occurs if the real amount of water stored in each reservoir in each time\nperiod is less than what planned by the optimizer. The multi-connection\nfunction and the risk make the problem rather complex such that traditional\nstochastic dynamic programming and deterministic/heuristic approaches are\ninappropriate. Our framework is based on a novel convex programming formulation\nin which stochastic information can be naturally taken into account and an\noptimal solution is guaranteed to be found efficiently.

As a consequence, they\nswap their orbits every 4 years, while their orbital periods is about 0.695\ndays. Recently, Tiscareno et al.(2009) got observational informations on the\nshapes and the rotational states of these satellites. In particular, they\ndetected an offset in the expected equilibrium position of Janus, and a large\nlibration of Epimetheus. We here propose to give a 3-dimensional theory of the\nrotation of these satellites in using these observed data, and to compare it to\nthe observed rotations. We consider the two satellites as triaxial rigid\nbodies, and we perform numerical integrations of the system in assuming the\nfree librations as damped. The periods of the three free librations we get,\nassociated with the 3 dimensions, are respectively 1.267, 2.179 and 2.098 days\nfor Janus, and 0.747, 1.804 and 5.542 days for Epimetheus. The proximity of\n0.747 days to the orbital period causes a high sensitivity of the librations of\nEpimetheus to the moments of inertia. Our theory explains the amplitude of the\nlibrations of Janus and the error bars of the librations of Epimetheus, but not\nan observed offset in the orientation of Janus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Dec 2009 11:06:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

An analytical explanation for the enhancement in intensity or\nbrightness such as usually modeled by the bow shock is given by a careful\nanalysis of the geometrical properties of the torus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Dec 2009 12:22:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-20"}
