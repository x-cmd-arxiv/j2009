The spatial correlation function is very well-described by\n(r/r_0)^-1.8, with r_0=2.7+-0.3Mpc/h. The correlation length r_0 increases\nstrongly with H-alpha luminosity, L_H-alpha, from r_0~2Mpc/h for the most\nquiescent galaxies (star-formation rates of ~4M_sun/yr), up to r_0>5Mpc/h for\nthe brightest galaxies in H-alpha. The correlation length also increases with\nincreasing rest-frame K-band luminosity (M_K), but the r_0-L_H-alpha\ncorrelation maintains its full statistical significance at fixed M_K. At\nz=0.84, star-forming galaxies classified as irregulars or mergers are much more\nclustered than discs and non-mergers, but once the samples are matched in\nL_H-alpha and M_K, the differences vanish, implying that the clustering is\nindependent of morphological type at z~1. The typical H-alpha emitters found at\nz=0.84 reside in dark-matter haloes of ~10^12M_sun, but those with the highest\nSFRs reside in more massive haloes of ~10^13M_sun. Comparing the results with\nthose of H-alpha surveys at different redshifts, it is seen that although the\nbreak of the H-alpha luminosity function, L*, evolves by a factor of ~30 from\nz=0.24 to z=2.23, galaxies with the same L_H-alpha/L*(z) are found in dark\nmatter haloes of similar masses, independently of cosmic time. This not only\nconfirms that star-formation is more efficient at higher redshift, but also\nsuggests a fundamental connection between the strong decrease of L* since\nz=2.23 and the quenching of star-formation in galaxies residing within\ndark-matter haloes significantly more massive than 10^12M_sun at any given\nepoch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2009 16:21:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Jan 2010 15:54:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

As a consequence, the cooling and accretion time of the gas\nsurrounding star-forming galaxies may increase by one or two orders of\nmagnitude.

The structural\nand ensuing semimetallic band structural forms are here rather unusual, with\nthe resulting ground state details extremely sensitive to the precise shape of\nthe Fe-X coordination unit. The superconductivity is presented as coming from a\ncombination of Resonant Valence Bond (RVB) and Excitonic Insulator physics, and\nincorporating Boson-Fermion degeneracy. Although sourced in a very different\nfashion the latter leads to some similarites with the high temperature\nsuperconducting (HTSC) cuprates. The Excitonic Insulator behaviour sees SDW,\nCDW/PLD and superconductive instabilities all vie for ground state status. The\nconflict leads to a very sensitive and complex set of properties, frequently\nmirroring HTSC cuprate behaviour. The delicate balance between ground states is\nmade particularly difficult to unravel by the micro-inhomogeneity of structural\nform which it can engender. It is pointed out that several other notable\nsuperconductors, layered in form, semimetallic with indirect overlap and\npossessing homopolar bonding, would look to fall into the same general\ncategory, beta-ZrNCl and MgB2 and the high-pressure forms of several elements,\nlike sulphur, phosphorus, lithium and calcium, being cases in point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2009 16:24:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2010 15:52:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The order associated with this\nform of spontaneous symmetry breaking is characterised by the emergence of\nquantum state reduction: systems which spontaneously break time translation\nsymmetry act as ideal measurement machines. In this review the breaking of time\ntranslation symmetry is first compared to that of other symmetries such as\nspatial translations and rotations. It is then discussed how broken time\ntranslation symmetry gives rise to the process of quantum state reduction and\nhow it generates a pointer basis, Born's rule, etc. After a comparison between\nthis model and alternative approaches to the problem of quantum state\nreduction, the experimental implications and possible tests of broken time\ntranslation symmetry in realistic experimental settings are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2009 16:32:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-29"}

We study in the context of\nf (R) gravity, how some modifications on General Relativity could reproduce\nsuch behavior of the cosmic evolution. It is showed that in general, an f (R)\ntheory can be reconstructed from a non-minimal scalar-tensor theory, where a\ndesired cosmological solution can be achieved. Some viable models are studied\nas well as its cosmological evolution, and the possibility that inflationary\nepoch is also a result of these fine modifications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2009 17:10:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

The EIT signal can be\ndetected with a heterodyne technique that provides noiseless gain; with this\ntechnique the optical phase shift of a 100 pW probe beam can be detected at the\nphoton shot-noise level. Numerical calculations of the density matrix equations\nare used to identify realistic operating parameters at which AC Stark shifts\nare eliminated.

The tentlike carpets attached to the sides of a square\ncylinder illustrate how the notion of a carpet on a wall naturally generalizes\nto sides of other small compact objects. We then extend the concept of flying\ncarpets to circular cylinders. However, instead of reducing its scattering\ncross-section like in acoustic cloaks, we rather mimic that of another\nobstacle, say a square rigid cylinder. For instance, show that one can hide any\ntype of defects under such circular carpets, and yet they still scatter waves\njust like a smaller cylinder on its own. Interestingly, all these carpets are\ndescribed by non-singular acoustic parameters.

We analysed the HST/STIS and\nFUSE spectra of this quasar and compared the results to Cloudy photoionization\nand collisional ionization models in order to derive densities, temperatures,\nand metallicities of the absorbing gas. The absorption can be explained by two\nC III clouds, offset by 35 km/s in velocity, with metallicities of ~one-tenth\nthe solar value. One cloud has a density of order n_H = 1.2 +0.9 -0.5 * 10^-3\ncm^-3 (thickness 0.4 +0.3 -0.2 kpc) and produces the observed C II and Si III\nabsorption, while the other has a density of order n_H = 1.2 +0.9 -0.5 * 10^-5\ncm^-3 (thickness 80 +70 -40 kpc) and gives rise to the observed weak C IV\nabsorption. Cloud temperatures are ~14,000 +3000 -2000 K and ~34,000 -4000\n+2000 K for photoionized models. Although collisionally ionized clouds with T ~\n70,000 K are possible, they are less likely because of the short cooling\ntime-scales involved. Previous studies revealed no luminous galaxy at the\nabsorber's redshift, so it is probably related to tidal debris, ejected\nmaterial, a dwarf galaxy, or other halo material in a galaxy group. Our models\nalso indicate that one of the two clouds would produce detectable weak Mg II\nabsorption if spectral coverage of that transition existed. We predict what the\nsystem would look like at z ~ 1 when the ionizing background radiation was more\nintense. We find that at z ~ 1 the denser component resembles a C IV absorber.\nThe second C III cloud in this z = 0.0777 absorber may be analogous to a subset\nof the more diffuse O VI absorbers at higher redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2009 01:26:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-07"}

This conclusion is even more important\nnow, when a large amount of space data coming from Kepler are currently being\nanalyzed.\n  The power spectrum of different stellar cases, and the non-adiabatic code\nGraCo have been used to estimate the upper limit of the energy per second\nrequired to excite all the observed modes, and their total kinetic energy. A\nnecessary previous step for this study is to infer the relative radial\npulsational amplitude from the observed photometric amplitude, scaling our\nlinear pulsational solutions to absolute values. The derived upper limits for\nthe required pulsational energy were compared with 1) the luminosity of the\nstar; and 2) the gravitational energy. We obtained that both upper energy\nlimits are orders of magnitude smaller.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2009 09:23:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The\nspectrum of the 8 o'clock arc is rich in stellar and interstellar medium (ISM)\nfeatures, and presents several similarities to the well-known MS1512-cB58 LBG.\nThe stellar photospheric absorption lines allowed us to constrain the systemic\nredshift, z_sys = 2.7350+/-0.0003, of the galaxy, and derive its stellar\nmetallicity, Z=0.82 Z_sol. With a total stellar mass of ~4.2x10^{11} M_sol, the\n8 o'clock arc agrees with the mass-metallicity relation found for z>2\nstar-forming galaxies. The 31 ISM absorption lines detected led to the\nabundance measurements of 9 elements. The metallicity of the ISM, Z=0.65 Z_sol\n(Si), is very comparable to the metallicity of stars and ionized gas, and\nsuggests that the ISM of the 8 o'clock arc has been rapidly polluted and\nenriched by ejecta of OB stars. The ISM lines extend over ~1000 km/s and have\ntheir peak optical depth blueshifted relative to the stars, implying gas\noutflows of about -120 km/s. The Ly-alpha line is dominated by a damped\nabsorption profile on top of which is superposed a weak emission, redshifted\nrelative to the ISM lines by about +690 km/s and resulting from multiply\nbackscattered Ly-alpha photons emitted in the HII region surrounded by the\ncold, expanding ISM shell. A homogeneous spherical radiation transfer shell\nmodel with a constant outflow velocity, determined by the observations, is able\nto reproduce the observed Ly-alpha line profile and dust content.

The models can be calibrated exactly to credit spreads using\nefficient closed-form formulas for default probabilities. Default events are\ncaused by the value of the firm assets hitting a safety threshold, which\ndepends on the financial situation of the company and on market conditions. In\nAT1P this default barrier is deterministic. Instead SBTV assumes two possible\nscenarios for the initial level of the default barrier, for taking into account\nuncertainty on balance sheet information. While in [19] and [15] the models are\nanalyzed across Parmalat's history, here we apply the models to exact\ncalibration of Lehman Credit Default Swap (CDS) data during the months\npreceding default, as the crisis unfolds. The results we obtain with AT1P and\nSBTV have reasonable economic interpretation, and are particularly realistic\nwhen SBTV is considered. The pricing of counterparty risk in an Equity Return\nSwap is a convenient application we consider, also to illustrate the\ninteraction of our credit models with equity models in hybrid products context.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2009 15:28:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-23"}

We found weak evidence for the\npresence of an iron line at ~6.8 keV, which is indicative of emission from\nhighly ionized iron. The 2-10 keV band spectrum is well fitted by a simple\npower law model, whose slope steepens with increasing flux, similar to what is\nobserved in other Seyferts as well. The soft excess is variable both in flux\nand shape, and it can be well described by a low-temperature Comptonisation\nmodel, whose slope flattens with increasing flux. The soft excess flux\nvariations are moderately correlated with the hard band variations, and we\nfound weak evidence that they are leading them by ~20 ksec.

From this, I produce various uniform products; (1) BVRIJHK\ncomparison star magnitudes and BV comparison star sequences to cover the entire\nrange of eruption, (2) complete light curves for all eruptions, (3) best fit B\nand V light curve templates, (4) orbital periods for all-but-one RN, (5)\nexhaustive searches for all missed eruptions, (6) measured discovery\nefficiencies since 1890, (7) true recurrence time scales, (8) predicted next\neruption dates, (9) variations on time scales of minutes, hours, days, months,\nyears, decades, and century, (10) uniform distances and extinctions to all RNe,\n(11) BV colors at peak and UBVRIJHK colors at minimum all with extinction\ncorrections, and (12) the spectral energy distributions over UBVRIJHK.\nHighlights of this work include the discoveries of one new RN, six\npreviously-undiscovered eruptions, and the discovery of the orbital periods for\nhalf the RNe. The goal of this work is to provide uniform demographics for\nanswering questions like the `What is the death rate of RNe in our galaxy?' and\n`Are the white dwarfs gaining or losing mass over each eruption cycle?'. An\nimportant use of this work is for the question of whether RNe can be the\nprogenitors of Type Ia supernovae.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2009 15:43:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

Both the new OLT data, taken with the same\ninstrumental setup as our data taken in 2008, as well as the simultaneously\nrecorded multicolor BUSCA data confirm the low inclination values reported\npreviously, and in fact suggest that the TrES-2b exoplanet has already passed\nthe first inclination threshold (i_min,1 = 83.417) and is not eclipsing the\nfull stellar surface any longer. Using the multi-band BUSCA data we demonstrate\nthat the multicolor light curves can be consistently fitted with a given set of\nlimb darkening coefficients without the need to adjust these coefficients, and\nfurther, we can demonstrate that wavelength dependent stellar radius changes\nmust be small as expected from theory. Our new observations provide further\nevidence for a change of the orbit inclination of the transiting extrasolar\nplanet TrES-2b reported previously. We examine in detail possible causes for\nthis inclination change and argue that the observed change should be\ninterpreted as nodal regression. While the assumption of an oblate host star\nrequires an unreasonably large second harmonic coefficient, the existence of a\nthird body in the form of an additional planet would provide a very natural\nexplanation for the observed secular orbit change. Given the lack of clearly\nobserved short-term variations of transit timing and our observed secular nodal\nregression rate, we predict a period between approximately 50 and 100 days for\na putative perturbing planet of Jovian mass. Such an object should be\ndetectable with present-day radial velocity (RV) techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2009 15:49:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2009 13:27:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

This peak\nshifts to the low temperature side with increasing $H$, according to the de\nAlmeida-Thouless critical line. We have undertaken an extensive study on the\n$T$ dependence of specific heat in the absence of an external field $H$ and in\nthe presence of $H$ along the $c$ plane. The magnetic specific heat $C_{mag}$\nat $H$ = 0 shows no anomaly at $T_{SG}$, but exhibits double broad peaks around\n5 K and 41 K. The magnetic specific heat $C_{mag}$ at $H$ = 0 is described by\n$C_{mag} \\propto (1/T^{2})\\exp(-\\Delta/T)$ with $\\Delta = 1.41 \\pm 0.03$ K,\nwhile $C_{mag}$ at $H$ = 10 kOe is proportional to $T$.
