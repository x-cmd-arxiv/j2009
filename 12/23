Our algorithm involves three steps: a reassignment of length, mass and\nvelocity units, a relabelling of the time axis, and a rescaling of the\namplitudes of individual large-scale fluctuation modes. We test it using two\nmatched pairs of simulations. Within each pair, one simulation assumes\nparameters consistent with analyses of the first-year WMAP data. The other has\nlower matter and baryon densities and a 15% lower fluctuation amplitude,\nconsistent with analyses of the three-year WMAP data. The pairs differ by a\nfactor of a thousand in mass resolution, enabling performance tests on both\nlinear and nonlinear scales. Our scaling reproduces the mass power spectra of\nthe target cosmology to better than 0.5% on large scales (k < 0.1 h/Mpc) both\nin real and in redshift space. In particular, the BAO features of the original\ncosmology are removed and are correctly replaced by those of the target\ncosmology. Errors are still below 3% for k < 1 h/Mpc. Power spectra of the dark\nhalo distribution are even more precisely reproduced, with errors below 1% on\nall scales tested.

By using a 2D quantum\nhydrodynamic model and the method of multiple scales, a new set of coupled\nnonlinear partial differential equations is derived which governs the slow\nmodulation of the 2D QIAW packets. The oblique modulational instability (MI) is\nthen studied by means of a corresponding nonlinear Schroedinger equation\nderived from the coupled nonlinear partial differential equations. It is shown\nthat the quantum parameter H (proportional to $\\hbar$), associated with the\nBohm potential, shifts the MI domains around the $k\\theta$-plane, where $k$ is\nthe carrier wave number and $\\theta$ is the angle of modulation. In particular,\nthe ion-acoustic wave (IAW), previously known to be stable under parallel\nmodulation in classical plasmas, is shown to be unstable in quantum plasmas.\nThe growth rate of the MI is found to be quenched by the obliqueness of\nmodulation. The modulation of 2D QIAW packets along $\\mathbf{k}$ is shown to be\ndescribed by a set of Davey-Stewartson-like equations. The latter can be\nstudied for the 2D wave collapse in dense plasmas.

The\nfirst consists of two layers of ionised material with column densities of N_H\n~5 x 10^22 cm^-2 and N_H ~3.5 x 10^23 cm^-2, respectively. The first layer is\nmoderately ionised and its ionisation levels follow the flux changes, while the\nother layer is highly ionised and does not show any correlation with the flux\nof the source. The spectra can also be interpreted assuming reflection by an\nionised accretion disk seen behind a warm absorber. The warm absorber\nionisation is consistent with being correlated with the flux of the source,\nwhich provides an additional degree of self-consistency with the overall\nreflection-based model. We explain the spectral variability with light bending\naccording to the models of Miniutti and Fabian and constrain the black hole\nspin to be a/M > 0.86.

We present the 'standard' such structures, the\nexponential fibrations of basic fibrations and three areas of applications.\nFirst area is related to the T-categories of A. Burroni. The monoids in the\nBurroni lax monoidal fibrations form the fibration of T-categories. The\nconstruction of the relative Burroni fibrations and free T-categories in this\ncontext, allow us to extend the definition of the set of opetopes given by T.\nLeinster to the category of opetopic sets (internally to any Grothendieck\ntopos, if needed). We also show that fibration of (1-level) multicategories,\nconsidered by Hermida-Makkai-Power, is equivalent to the fibration of\n(finitary, cartesian) polynomial monads. This equivalence is induced by the\nequivalence of lax monoidal fibrations of amalgamated signatures, polynomial\ndiagrams, and polynomial (finitary, endo) functors.

Species trees represent populations of individuals\n-- each with many genes -- splitting into new populations or species. The\ncoalescent process, which models ancestry of gene copies within populations, is\noften used to model the probability distribution of gene trees given a fixed\nspecies tree. This multispecies coalescent model provides a framework for\nphylogeneticists to infer species trees from gene trees using maximum\nlikelihood or Bayesian approaches. Because the coalescent models a branching\nprocess over time, all trees are typically assumed to be rooted in this\nsetting. Often, however, gene trees inferred by traditional phylogenetic\nmethods are unrooted.\n  We investigate probabilities of unrooted gene trees under the multispecies\ncoalescent model. We show that when there are 4 species with one gene sampled\nper species, the distribution of unrooted gene tree topologies identifies the\nunrooted species tree topology and some, but not all, information in the\nspecies tree edges (branch lengths). The location of the root on the species\ntree is not identifiable in this situation. However, for 5 or more species with\none gene sampled per species, we show that the distribution of unrooted gene\ntree topologies identifies the rooted species tree topology and all its\ninternal branch lengths. The length of any pendent branch leading to a leaf of\nthe species tree is also identifiable for any species from which more than one\ngene is sampled.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2009 18:00:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2010 18:07:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-30"}

We describe the construction of the emulator,\nexplain the tests performed to ensure its accuracy, and discuss how the central\nideas may be extended to a wider range of cosmological models and applications.\nA power spectrum emulator code is released publicly as part of this paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2009 19:09:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 2010 16:48:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 10 May 2013 13:51:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-13"}

To resolve the fine differences between\nions of the same valence and roughly similar size and in particular to\ncorrectly describe ion-specific effects, it is clear that accurate force fields\nare necessary. In the past, optimization strategies for ionic force fields\neither considered single-ion properties (such as the solvation free energy at\ninfinite dilution or the ion-water structure) or ion-pair properties (in the\nform of ion-ion distribution functions). In this paper we investigate\nstrategies to optimize ionic force fields based on single-ion and ion-pair\nproperties simultaneously. To that end, we simulate five different salt\nsolutions, namely CsCl, KCl, NaI, KF, and CsI, at finite ion concentration. The\nforce fields of these ions are systematically varied under the constraint that\nthe single-ion solvation free energy matches the experimental value, which\nreduces the two-dimensional $\\{\\sigma,\\epsilon\\}$ parameter space of the\nLennard Jones interaction to a one dimensional line for each ion. From the\nfinite-concentration simulations, the pair-potential is extracted and the\nosmotic coefficient is calculated, which is compared to experimental data. We\nfind a strong dependence of the osmotic coefficient on the force field, which\nis remarkable as the single-ion solvation free energy and the ion-water\nstructure remain invariant under the parameter variation. Optimization of the\nforce field is achieved for the cations Cs$^+$ and K$^+$, while for the anions\nI$^-$ and F$^-$ the experimental osmotic coefficient cannot be reached. This\nsuggests that in the long run, additional parameters might have to be\nintroduced into the modeling, for example by modified mixing rules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2009 22:19:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The bodies change their orientation relative to\neach other in a way which mimics the swimming of fish. In contrast to previous\nsimulations the bodies are connected by an elastic skin. The skin responds to\nthe movement of the bodies and the pressure of the fluid and alters the flow\naround the bodies. In particular it prevents fluid moving between them. The\nsystem of bodies and skin is similar in appearance to a swimming leech or\ntadpole depending on the relative size of the bodies. We simulate the system\nusing SPH, with three types of particles: liquid particles, boundary force\nparticles determining the surface of the rigid bodies, and skin particles\ndefining the elastic skin. The latter interact with each other, and with the\nboundary force particles to which they are anchored, by linear spring forces.\nThe boundary force particles and the skin particles interact with the fluid\nparticles by pair forces which are similar to the forces used in the Immersed\nBoundary method. The algorithm is based on a Lagrangian, and the equations of\nmotion conserve linear momentum exactly and angular momentum very accurately.\nWe compare the motion of rigid bodies with and without skin keeping the total\nmass of the bodies plus skin fixed. When the ellipses are identical, and the\nforward gait is used, the bodies swim ~13% faster when they are connected by\nskin, and they require less energy. When the ellipses have different sizes,\nwith the front ellipse largest, they travel ~39% faster and use less energy.\nThe algorithm is simple and robust and can be applied to bodies of arbitrary\nshape and in domains which include free surfaces and stratified fluids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2009 06:53:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-24"}

They interact with their stars affecting their angular momentum.\nRecent observations provide suggestive evidence of excess angular momentum in\nstars with hot Jupiters in comparison to stars with distant and less massive\nplanets. This has been attributed to tidal interaction, but needs to be\ninvestigated in more detail considering also other possible explanations\nbecause in several cases the tidal synchronization time scales are much longer\nthan the ages of the stars. We select stars harbouring transiting hot Jupiters\nto study their rotation and find that those with an effective temperature\ngreater than 6000 K and a rotation period shorter than 10 days are synchronized\nwith the orbital motion of their planets or have a rotation period\napproximately twice that of the planetary orbital period. Stars with an\neffective temperature lower than 6000 K and a rotation period longer than 10\ndays show a general trend toward synchronization with increasing effective\ntemperature or decreasing orbital period. We propose a model for the angular\nmomentum evolution of stars with hot Jupiters to interpret these observations.\nIt is based on the hypothesis that a close-in giant planet affects the coronal\nfield of its host star leading to a topology with predominantly closed field\nlines. Our model can be tested observationally and has relevant consequences\nfor the relationship between stellar rotation and close-in giant planets as\nwell as for the application of gyrochronology to estimate the age of\nplanet-hosting stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2009 08:56:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The focus is on the steady\nstate behavior in situations where a positive current is constrained to an\nextended subsystem (either by appropriate boundary conditions or by the\nembedding environment) where, in the absence of the constraint, the current\nwould be negative. We have found two qualitatively different types of steady\nstates and formulated the conditions of them in terms of the transition rates.\nIn the first type of steady state, a localized cluster of particles forms with\nan anti-shock located in the subsystem and the current vanishes exponentially\nwith the extension of the subsystem. This behavior is analogous to that of the\none-lane partially asymmetric simple exclusion process, and can be realized\ne.g. when the local drive is induced by making the jump rates in two lanes\nunequal. In the second type of steady state, which is realized e.g. if the\nlocal drive is induced purely by the bias in the lane change rates, and which\nhas thus no counterpart in the one-lane model, a delocalized cluster of\nparticles forms which performs a diffusive motion as a whole and, as a\nconsequence, the current vanishes inversely proportionally to the extension of\nthe subsystem. The model is also studied in the presence of quenched\ndisordered, where, in case of delocalization, phenomenological considerations\npredict anomalously slow, logarithmic decay of the current with the system size\nin contrast with the usual power-law.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2009 11:24:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Since complete orders are acyclic digraphs that\npossess a known topology, it is possible to define an acyclic structure to\nroute packets between a group of Autonomous Systems. The adoption of complete\norders also allows easy identification and avoidance of persistent route\noscillations, eliminates the possibility of developing transient loops in\npaths, and provides a structure that facilitates the implementation of traffic\nengineering. Moreover, by combining Chain Routing with other mechanisms that\nimplement complete orders in time, we suggest that it is possible to design a\nnew routing protocol which could be more reliable and stable than BGP's current\nimplementation. Although Chain Routing will require an increase of the message\noverhead and greater coordination between network administrators, the rewards\nin stability and resilience should more than compensate for this effort.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2009 11:35:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 3 Apr 2010 04:28:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-25"}

During late-stage solidification, crystal-melt interfaces may\nattract or repel each other depending on the degree of misorientation between\nimpinging grains, temperature, composition, and stress. To characterize this\ninteraction, we map the multi-phase-field equations for stationary interfaces\nto a multi-dimensional classical mechanical scattering problem. From the\nsolution of this problem, we derive asymptotic forms for short-range forces\nbetween interfaces for distances larger than the interface thickness. The\nresults show that forces are always attractive for traditional models where\neach phase-field represents the phase fraction of a given grain. Those\npredictions are validated by numerical computations of forces for all\ndistances. Based on insights from the scattering problem, we propose a new\nmulti-phase-field formulation that can describe both attractive and repulsive\nforces in real systems. This model is then used to investigate the influence of\nsolute addition and a uniaxial stress perpendicular to the interface. Solute\naddition leads to bistability of different interfacial equilibrium states, with\nthe temperature range of bistability increasing with strength of partitioning.\nStress in turn, is shown to be equivalent to a temperature change through a\nstandard Clausius-Clapeyron relation. The implications of those results for\nunderstanding grain boundary premelting are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2009 12:27:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Particularly in the very thin inert envelopes of subdwarf B stars,\ndiffusive movements will considerably change the envelope structure and the\nsurface abundances on a short timescale. Also, the subdwarfs will inherit the\neffects of diffusion in their direct progenitors, namely giants near the tip of\nthe red giant branch. This will influence the global evolution and the\npulsational properties of subdwarf B stars. We investigate the impact of\ngravitational settling, thermal diffusion and concentration diffusion on the\nevolution and pulsations of subdwarf B stars. Our diffusive stellar models are\ncompared with models evolved without diffusion. We constructed subdwarf B\nmodels with a mass of 0.465 Msun from a 1 and 3 Msun ZAMS progenitor. The low\nmass star ignited helium in an energetic flash, while the intermediate mass\nstar started helium fusion gently. For each progenitor type we computed series\nwith and without atomic diffusion. Atomic diffusion in red giants causes the\nhelium core mass at the onset of helium ignition to be larger. We find an\nincrease of 0.0015 Msun for the 1 Msun model and 0.0036 Msun for the 3 Msun\nmodel. The effects on the red giant surface abundances are small after the\nfirst dredge up. The evolutionary tracks of the diffusive subdwarf B models are\nshifted to lower surface gravities and effective temperatures due to outward\ndiffusion of hydrogen. This affects both the frequencies of the excited modes\nand the overall frequency spectrum.

We use the 31 clusters from the\nREXCESS sample, compiled from the southern ROSAT All-Sky cluster survey REFLEX\nwith a morphologically unbiased selection in X-ray luminosity and redshift, all\nof which have been reobserved with XMM-Newton. We investigate the uncertainties\nof the substructure parameters and examine the dependence of the results on\nprojection effects, finding that the uncertainties of the parameters can be\nquite substantial. Thus while the quantification of the dynamical state of\nindividual clusters with these parameters should be treated with extreme\ncaution, these substructure measures provide powerful statistical tools to\ncharacterise trends of properties in large cluster samples. The centre shift\nparameter, w, is found to be more sensitive in general. For the REXCESS sample\nneither the occurence of substructure nor the presence of cool cores depends on\ncluster mass. There is a significant anti-correlation between the existence of\nsubstantial substructure and cool cores. The simulated clusters show on average\nlarger substructure parameters than the observed clusters, a trend that is\ntraced to the fact that cool regions are more pronounced in the simulated\nclusters, leading to stronger substructure measures in merging clusters and\nclusters with offset cores. Moreover, the frequency of cool regions is higher\nin the simulations than in the observations, implying that the description of\nthe physical processes shaping cluster formation in the simulations requires\nfurther improvement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2009 15:50:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

New methods for reconstructing the direction and\ncomposition-sensitive properties of muon bundles are shown. Based on a\nlikelihood minimization procedure using IceCube signals, and accounting for\nphoton propagation, ice properties, and the energy loss processes of muons in\nice, the muon bundle energy loss is reconstructed. The results of the\nhigh-energy muon bundle reconstruction in the deep ice and the reconstruction\nof the lateral distribution of low energy particles in the surface detector can\nbe combined to study primary composition and energy.
