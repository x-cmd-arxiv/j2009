We find that\nUBVK colors from our simulations are consistent with simple stellar population\n(SSP) models, provided the cluster mass is large, Mcluster >= 10^6 M_Sun. Below\nthis mass, our simulations show two significant effects. First, the mean value\nof the distribution of integrated colors moves away from the SSP predictions\nand is less red, in the first 10^7 to 10^8 years in UBV colors, and for all\nages in (V - K). Second, the 1\\sigma dispersion of observed colors increases\nsignificantly with lower cluster mass.

The purpose of this work is to investigate the interstellar\nmedium around the mentioned sources in order to look for possible counterparts\nof the very-high energy emission. Using the 13CO J=1-0 line from the Galactic\nRing Survey and mid-IR data from GLIMPSE we analyze the environs of HESS\nJ1858+020 and SNR G35.6-0.4. The 13CO data show the presence of a molecular\ncloud towards the southern border of SNR G35.6-0.4 and at the same distance as\nthe remnant. This cloud is composed by two molecular clumps, one, over the SNR\nshell and the other located at the center of HESS J1858+020.

FKSI has been\nendorsed by the Exoplanet Community Forum 2008 as such a mission and has been\ncosted to be within the expected budget. The current design of FKSI is a\ntwo-element nulling interferometer. The two telescopes, separated by 12.5 m,\nare precisely pointed (by small steering mirrors) on the target star. The two\npath lengths are accurately controlled to be the same to within a few\nnanometers. A phase shifter/beam combiner (Mach-Zehnder interferometer)\nproduces an output beam consisting of the nulled sum of the target planet's\nlight and the host star's light. When properly oriented, the starlight is\nnulled by a factor of 10^-4, and the planet light is undiminished. Accurate\nmodeling of the signal is used to subtract the residual starlight, permitting\nthe detection of planets much fainter than the host star. The current version\nof FKSI with 0.5-m apertures and waveband 3-8 microns has the following main\ncapabilities: (1) detect exozodiacal emission levels to that of our own solar\nsystem (1 Solar System Zodi) around nearby F, G, and K, stars; (2) characterize\nspectroscopically the atmospheres of a large number of known non-transiting\nplanets; (3) survey and characterize nearby stars for planets down to 2 Earth\nradii from just inside the habitable zone and inward. An enhanced version of\nFKSI with 1-m apertures separated by 20 m and cooled to 40 K, with science\nwaveband 5-15 microns, allows for the detection and characterization of 2\nEarth-radius super-Earths and smaller planets in the habitable zone around\nstars within about 30 pc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2009 20:56:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-15"}

The Orbit Determination Program (ODP) of\nNASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which was used in the data analysis, is based\non an expression for the gravitational delay which differs from the standard\nformula; this difference is of second order in powers of $m$ -- the sun's\ngravitational radius -- but in Cassini's case it was much larger than the\nexpected order of magnitude $m^2/b$, where $b$ is the ray's closest approach\ndistance. Since the ODP does not account for any other second-order terms, it\nis necessary, also in view of future more accurate experiments, to\nsystematically evaluate higher order corrections and to determine which terms\nare significant. Light propagation in a static spacetime is equivalent to a\nproblem in ordinary geometrical optics; Fermat's action functional at its\nminimum is just the light-time between the two end points A and B. A new and\npowerful formulation is thus obtained. Asymptotic power series are necessary to\nprovide a safe and automatic way of selecting which terms to keep at each\norder. Higher order approximations to the delay and the deflection are\nobtained. We also show that in a close superior conjunction, when $b$ is much\nsmaller than the distances of A and B from the Sun, of order $R$, say, the\nsecond-order correction has an \\emph{enhanced} part of order $m^2R/b^2$, which\ncorresponds just to the second-order terms introduced in the ODP. Gravitational\ndeflection of the image of a far away source, observed from a finite distance\nfrom the mass, is obtained to $O(m^2)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2009 18:55:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

For each source,\nX-ray spectra from different states were fitted with the recently proposed\nmodel compTB. The spectra have been fit with a two-compTB model. In all cases\nthe first compTB describes the dominant part of the spectrum that we interpret\nas thermal Comptonization of soft seed photons (< 1 keV), likely from the\naccretion disk, by a 3-5 keV corona. In all cases, this component does not\nevolve much in terms of Comptonization efficiency, with the system converging\nto thermal equilibrium for increasing accretion rate. The second compTB varies\nmore dramatically spanning from bulk plus thermal Comptonization of blackbody\nseed photons to the blackbody emission alone. These seed photons (R < 12 km,\nkT_s > 1 keV), likely from the neutron star and the innermost part of the\nsystem, the Transition Layer, are Comptonized by matter in a converging flow.\nThe presence and nature of this second compTB component (be it a pure blackbody\nor Comptonized) are related to the inner local accretion rate which can\ninfluence the transient behaviour of the hard tail: high values of accretion\nrates correspond to an efficient Bulk Comptonization process (bulk parameter\ndelta > 0) while even higher values of accretion rates suppress the\nComptonization, resulting in simple blackbody emission (delta=0).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2009 19:04:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Previous calculations have found that the two-point function can\nhave a logarithmic running of the form log(k/mu), where k is the wavenumber of\nthe perturbation, and mu is the renormalization scale. We highlight that this\nresult would have profound consequences for both eternal inflation and the\npredictivity of standard inflation. We find a different result. We consider two\nsets of theories: one where the inflaton has a large cubic self-interaction and\none where the inflaton interacts gravitationally with N massless spectator\nscalar fields. We find that there is a logarithmic running but of the form\nlog(H/mu), where H is the Hubble constant during inflation. We find this result\nin three independent ways: by performing the calculation with a sharp cutoff in\nfrequency-momentum space, in dimensional regularization and by the simple\nprocedure of making the loop integral dimensionless. For the simplest of our\ntheories we explicitly renormalize the correlation function proving that the\ndivergencies can be reabsorbed and that the correlation function for\nsuper-horizon modes does not depend on time (once the tadpole terms have been\nproperly taken into account). We prove the time-independence of the\nsuper-horizon correlation function in several additional ways: by doing the\ncalculation of the correlation function at finite time using both the\nregularizations and by developing a formalism which expresses loop corrections\ndirectly in terms of renormalized quantities at each time. We find this last\nformalism particularly helpful to develop intuition which we then use to\ngeneralize our results to higher loops and different interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2009 21:40:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-09"}

In this paper, we\ninvestigate fast map-making methods as applied to long duration, massively\nmulti-detector, ground-based experiments, in the context of the search for\nB-modes. We focus on two alternative map-making approaches: destriping and TOD\nfiltering, comparing their performance on simulated multi-detector polarisation\ndata.

We find that destriping can out-perform\nfiltering in estimating both the large-scale E and B-mode angular power\nspectra. In particular, filtering can produce significant spurious B-mode power\nvia EB mixing. Whilst this can be removed, it contributes to the variance of\nB-mode bandpower estimates at scales near the primordial B-mode peak. For the\nexperimental configuration we simulate, this has an effect on the possible\ndetection significance for primordial B-modes.

We then outline a series of modifications to the model necessary\nto solve these problems: a) Instead of instantaneous stripping of the external\ngas reservoir after a galaxy becomes a satellite, the gas supply is assumed to\ndecrease at the same rate that the surrounding halo loses mass due to tidal\nstripping, b) The AGN feedback efficiency is lowered to bring the fraction of\nmassive passive centrals in better agreement with the data. We also allow for\nradio mode AGN feedback in satellite galaxies. c) We assume that satellite\ngalaxies residing in host haloes with masses below 10^12 M_sun do not undergo\nany stripping. We highlight the fact that in low mass galaxies, the external\nreservoir is composed primarily of gas that has been expelled from the galactic\ndisk by supernovae driven winds.

We aim at investigating the physical mechanism leading to the irregular\nknotty structure observed in jets in different bands and the complex\ninteractions occurring among blobs of plasma ejected from the stellar source.\nWe perform 2D axisymmetric HD simulations of a randomly ejected pulsed jet. The\njet consists of a train of blobs which ram with supersonic speed into the\nambient medium. The initial random velocity of each blob follows an exponential\ndistribution. We explore the ejection rate parameter to derive constraints on\nthe physical properties of protostellar jets by comparison of model results\nwith observations. Our model takes into account radiative losses and thermal\nconduction. We find that the mutual interactions of blobs ejected at different\nepochs and with different speed lead to a variety of plasma components not\ndescribed by current models. The main features characterizing the random pulsed\njet scenario are: single high speed knots, showing a measurable proper motion\nin nice agreement with observations; irregular chains of knots aligned along\nthe jet axis and possibly interacting with each other; reverse shocks\ninteracting with outgoing knots; oblique shocks produced by the reflection of\nshocks at the jet cocoon. All these structures concur to determine the\nmorphology of the jet in different bands.

In 2007,\nBorwein and Wiersma [SIAM J.

In\naddition, radial velocity variations with a semi-amplitude of up to 1 km/s were\ndetected.

The presence of the\nclose-in massive planet could also be an interpretation for the high level of\nstellar activity detected.

Its goal is to find the states reachable from the initial state of a\ndiscrete-state model described. The state space can used to answer important\nquestions, e.g., \"Is there a dead state?\" and \"Can N become negative?\", or as a\nstarting point for sophisticated investigations expressed in temporal logic.\n  Unfortunately, the state space is often so large that ordinary explicit data\nstructures and sequential algorithms cannot cope, prompting the exploration of\n(1) parallel approaches using multiple processors, from simple workstation\nnetworks to shared-memory supercomputers, to satisfy large memory and runtime\nrequirements and (2) symbolic approaches using decision diagrams to encode the\nlarge structured sets and relations manipulated during state-space generation.\n  Both approaches have merits and limitations. Parallel explicit state-space\ngeneration is challenging, but almost linear speedup can be achieved; however,\nthe analysis is ultimately limited by the memory and processors available.\nSymbolic methods are a heuristic that can efficiently encode many, but not all,\nfunctions over a structured and exponentially large domain; here the pitfalls\nare subtler: their performance varies widely depending on the class of decision\ndiagram chosen, the state variable order, and obscure algorithmic parameters.\n  As symbolic approaches are often much more efficient than explicit ones for\nmany practical models, we argue for the need to parallelize symbolic\nstate-space generation algorithms, so that we can realize the advantage of both\napproaches. This is a challenging endeavor, as the most efficient symbolic\nalgorithm, Saturation, is inherently sequential.

This region is selected to\navoid 'strong' absorption lines accompanied with contaminating emission\ncomponents. The same analysis is applied to archive data of Gemini/GMOS taken\nat phi=0.84-0.30 by Hillwig & Gies (2008). From the Subaru and Gemini CCF\nresults, the amplitude of radial velocity curve of the donor star is determined\nto be 58.3+/-3.8 km s-1 with a systemic velocity of 59.2+/-2.5 km s-1. Together\nwith the radial velocity curve of the compact object, we derive the mass of the\ndonor star and compact object to be M_O=12.4+/-1.9 M_sun and M_X=4.3+/-0.6\nM_sun, respectively. We conclude, however, that these values should be taken as\nupper limits. From the analysis of the averaged absorption line profiles of\nstrong lines and weak lines observed with Subaru, we find evidence for heating\neffects from the compact object. Using a simple model, we find that the true\nradial velocity amplitude of the donor star could be as low as 40+/-5 km s-1 in\norder to produce the observed absorption-line profiles.

We\nfurther give an alternative formulation of the kernel least-squares estimator\nwhich is shown to possess an even smaller condition number. We show that\nnumerical studies meet our theoretical analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2009 05:45:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-16"}

Methodology/Principal Findings: This paper proposes an\nalgorithm to create an artificial population where individuals are described by\ntheir age, and are gathered in households respecting a variety of statistical\nconstraints (distribution of household types, sizes, age of household head,\ndifference of age between partners and among parents and children). Such a\npopulation is often the initial state of microsimulation or (agent)\nindividual-based models. To get a realistic distribution of households is often\nvery important, because this distribution has an impact on the demographic\nevolution.

If one\nstudies the Lindstedt series, one finds that convergence is ultimately related\nto the presence of cancellations between contributions of the same perturbation\norder. In turn, this is due to symmetries in the problem. Such symmetries are\neasily visualised in action-angle coordinates, where KAM theorem is usually\nformulated, by exploiting the analogy between Lindstedt series and perturbation\nexpansions in quantum field theory and, in particular, the possibility of\nexpressing the solutions in terms of tree graphs, which are the analogue of\nFeynman diagrams. If the unperturbed system is isochronous, Moser's modifying\nterms theorem ensures that an analytic quasi-periodic solution with the same\nDiophantine frequency vector as the unperturbed Hamiltonian exists for the\nsystem obtained by adding a suitable constant (counterterm) to the vector\nfield. Also in this case, one can follow the alternative approach of studying\nthe perturbation expansion for both the solution and the counterterm, and again\nconvergence of the two series is obtained as a consequence of deep\ncancellations between contributions of the same order. We revisit Moser's\ntheorem, by studying the perturbation expansion one obtains by working in\nCartesian coordinates. We investigate the symmetries giving rise to the\ncancellations which makes possible the convergence of the series.

MANETs are highly vulnerable to attacks due to the open medium,\ndynamically changing network topology and lack of centralized monitoring point.\nIt is important to search new architecture and mechanisms to protect the\nwireless networks and mobile computing application. IDS analyze the network\nactivities by means of audit data and use patterns of well-known attacks or\nnormal profile to detect potential attacks. There are two methods to analyze:\nmisuse detection and anomaly detection. Misuse detection is not effective\nagainst unknown attacks and therefore, anomaly detection method is used. In\nthis approach, the audit data is collected from each mobile node after\nsimulating the attack and compared with the normal behavior of the system. If\nthere is any deviation from normal behavior then the event is considered as an\nattack. Some of the features of collected audit data may be redundant or\ncontribute little to the detection process. So it is essential to select the\nimportant features to increase the detection rate. This paper focuses on\nimplementing two feature selection methods namely, markov blanket discovery and\ngenetic algorithm. In genetic algorithm, bayesian network is constructed over\nthe collected features and fitness function is calculated. Based on the fitness\nvalue the features are selected. Markov blanket discovery also uses bayesian\nnetwork and the features are selected depending on the minimum description\nlength. During the evaluation phase, the performances of both approaches are\ncompared based on detection rate and false alarm rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2009 10:57:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 30 May 2010 09:00:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-01"}

Fourthly, and perhaps most importantly, the concept of time is\nclassical and hence external to quantum mechanics : there should exist an\nequivalent reformulation of the theory which does not refer to an external\nclassical time. In this paper we argue that such a reformulation is the\nlimiting case of a nonlinear quantum theory, with the nonlinearity becoming\nimportant at the Planck mass scale. Such a nonlinearity can provide insights\ninto the problems mentioned above. We use a physically motivated model for a\nnonlinear Schrodinger equation to show that nonlinearity can help in\nunderstanding quantum measurement.

Here we present a numerical study of cascaded\nquadratic soliton compression of such pulses in LiNbO$_3$ using a type I phase\nmatching configuration. We find that because of competing cubic material\nnonlinearities compression can only occur in the nonstationary regime, where\ngroup-velocity mismatch induced Raman-like nonlocal effects prevent compression\nto below 100 fs. However, the strong group velocity dispersion implies that the\npulses can achieve moderate compression to sub-130 fs duration in available\ncrystal lengths. Most of the pulse energy is conserved because the compression\nis moderate. The effects of diffraction and spatial walk-off is addressed, and\nin particular the latter could become an issue when compressing in such long\ncrystals (around 10 cm long). We finally show that the second harmonic contains\na short pulse locked to the pump and a long multi-ps red-shifted detrimental\ncomponent. The latter is caused by the nonlocal effects in the nonstationary\nregime, but because it is strongly red-shifted to a position that can be\npredicted, we show that it can be removed using a bandpass filter, leaving a\nsub-100 fs visible component at $\\lambda=515$ nm with excellent pulse quality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2009 13:41:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-21"}

The fast\ndynamics exhibit attractors which may bifurcate under the influence of the slow\ndynamics which is seen as a parameter of the fast dynamics. A generic solution\ncomes close to a connected component of the stable invariant sets of the fast\ndynamics. As the slow dynamics evolves, this attractor may lose its stability\nand the solution eventually reaches quickly another connected component of\nattractors of the fast dynamics and the process may repeat. This scenario\nexplains quite well relaxation and bursting oscillations. More recently, in\nrelation both with theory of dynamical systems and with applications to\nphysiology, a new interest has emerged in canard cycles. These orbits share the\nproperty that they remain for a while close to an unstable invariant set\n(either singular set or periodic orbits of the fast dynamics).

The\nrelevance and gauge equivalence of the clock synchronization conventions for\nthe identification of the instantaneous 3-spaces (Euclidean only in inertial\nframes) are described.

We examine decoupling quantitatively for two-body observables and\nfew-body binding energies. The universal nature of this decoupling is\nillustrated and errors from suppressing high-momentum modes above the\ndecoupling scale are shown to be perturbatively small.

Duration of these\nfeatures is very short and the predicted polarization varies abruptly on the\ntime-scale comparable with the light-crossing time of the system -- a signature\nof the photon orbit. We also consider the polarization properties of scattered\nlight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2009 15:59:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2009 20:52:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-16"}
