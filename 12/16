The promotion of\nNewton's constant to a time-function introduces modifications to the binary's\nbinding energy and the gravitational wave luminosity, leading to corrections in\nthe chirping frequency. Such corrections propagate into the response function\nand, given a gravitational wave observation, they allow for constraints on the\nfirst time-derivative of Newton's constant at the time of merger.

For instance, the influence\nof antisymmetrisation in the Hoyle state on the bosonic character of the alpha\nparticles is studied carefully. It is shown to be weak, so that bosonic aspects\nare predominant. The de Broglie wave length of alpha particles in the Hoyle\nstate is shown to be much larger than the inter-alpha distance. It is pointed\nout that the bosonic features of low density alpha gas states have measurable\nconsequences, one of which, that is enhanced multi-alpha decay properties,\nlikely already have been detected. Consistent with experiment, the width of the\nproposed analogue to the Hoyle state in 16O at the excitation energy of\nE_x=15.1 MeV is estimated to be very small (34 keV), lending credit to the\nexistence of heavier Hoyle-like states. The intrinsic single boson density\nmatrix of a self-bound Bose system can, under physically desirable boundary\nconditions, be defined unambiguously. One eigenvalue then separates out, being\nclose to the number of alpha's in the system. Differences between Brink and\nTHSR alpha cluster wave functions are worked out. No cluster model of the Brink\ntype can describe the Hoyle state with a single configuration. On the contrary,\nmany superpositions of the Brink type are necessary, implying delocalisation\ntowards an alpha product state.

Important differences between\nthe superconducting (SC) state of these materials and conventional\nsuperconductors include the d-wave pairing symmetry and a remarkable magnetic\nresponse to nonmagnetic perturbations, whereby droplets of spin-density wave\n(SDW) order can form around impurities and the cores of vortices. In a simple\npicture, whenever SC is suppressed locally, SDW order is nucleated. Within a\nmean-field theory of d-wave SC in an applied magnetic field including disorder\nand Hubbard correlations, we show in fact that the creation of SDW order is not\nsimply due to suppression of the SC order parameter, but rather due to a\ncorrelation-induced splitting of the electronic bound state created by the\nperturbation. Since the bound state exists because of the sign change of the\norder parameter along quasiparticle trajectories, the induced SDW order is a\ndirect consequence of the d-wave symmetry. Furthermore the formation of\nanti-phase domain walls is important for obtaining the correct temperature\ndependence of the induced magnetism as measured by neutron diffraction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2009 18:25:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-07"}

Its action is that of\nG/H=Sp(2,2)xSp(4)/SU(2)^4 gauged WZW model deformed by an integrable potential\nand coupled to fermions. This theory is UV finite and is conjectured to be\nrelated to the superstring theory also at the quantum level. Expanded near the\ntrivial vacuum it has the same elementary excitations (8+8 massive bosonic and\nfermionic 2-d degrees of freedom) as the AdS_5 x S^5 superstring in the\nlight-cone gauge or near plane-wave expansion. In contrast to the superstring\ncase, the interaction terms in the reduced action are manifestly 2-d Lorentz\ninvariant. Since the theory is integrable, its S-matrix should be effectively\ndetermined by the two-particle scattering.

The leading length enhanced parts of\nthese power suppressed contributions are resummed. Various interferences\nbetween such diagrams lead to the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) effect.

One way to explain this\nfinding is a top-heavy IMF, so that the unseen mass is provided by additional\nremnants of high-mass stars. A possible explanation for why the IMF in UCDs\ncould be top-heavy while this is not the case in less massive stellar systems\nis that encounters between proto-stars and stars become probable in forming\nmassive systems. However, the required number of additional stellar remnants\nproves to be rather high, which raises the question of how their progenitors\nwould affect the early evolution of a UCD. We have therefore calculated the\nfirst 200 Myr of the evolution of the UCDs, using the particle-mesh code\nSuperbox. It is assumed that the stellar populations of UCDs were created in an\ninitial starburst, which implies heavy mass loss during the following\napproximately 40 Myr due to primordial gas expulsion and supernova explosions.\nWe find at the end of the simulations for various initial conditions and\n(tabulated) mass-loss histories objects that roughly resemble UCDs.

We find that the\nradio source is radiatively inefficient, with a ratio of radio luminosity to\nmechanical cavity power of $\\sim 10^{-4}$, and that the radio pressure of the\nlobes is about one order of magnitude lower than the X-ray pressure of the\nsurrounding thermal gas. Thanks to the high spatial resolution of the Chandra\nsurface brightness and temperature profiles, we also identify a shock front\nlocated at 36 kpc to the south-west of the group center, close to the southern\nradio lobe, with a Mach number $\\sim 1.5$ and a total power which is about one\norder of magnitude higher than the cavity power. Such a shock may have heated\nthe gas in the southern region, as indicated by the temperature map. The shock\nmay also explain the arc-like region of enriched gas seen in the iron abundance\nmap, as this may be produced by a non-Maxwellian electron distribution near its\nfront.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2009 21:40:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2010 16:31:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

In the Cassini era, high\nspatial and spectral resolution data have allowed progress to be made on some\nof these questions.

For a class of many-to-one interference channels, we identify a\nnoisy interference regime, i.e., a regime where random coding and treating\ninterference as noise achieves sum-capacity. Specializing our results to the\nGaussian MIMO many-to-one interference channel, which is a special case of the\nclass of channels considered, we obtain new capacity results. Firstly, we\nextend the noisy interference regime, previously studied for (many-to-one)\ninterference channels with average power constraints on the inputs, to a more\ngeneral class of inputs. This more general class includes the practical\nscenario of inputs being restricted to fixed finite-size constellations such as\nPSK or QAM. Secondly, we extend noisy interference results previously studied\nin SISO interference channels with full channel state information (CSI) at all\nnodes, to MIMO and parallel Gaussian many-to-one interference channels, and to\nfading Gaussian many-to-one interference channels without CSI at the\ntransmitters. While the many-to-one interference channel requires interference\nalignment, which in turn requires structured codes in general, we argue that in\nthe noisy interference regime, interference is implicitly aligned by random\ncoding irrespective of the input distribution. As a byproduct of our study, we\nidentify a second class of many-to-one interference channels (albeit\ndeterministic) where random coding is optimal (though interference is not\ntreated as noise). The optimality of random coding in this second class of\nchannels is due to an interference resolvability condition which precludes\ninterference alignment and hence obviates the need of structured codes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2009 23:13:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-17"}

This interest stems from the realization that glia participates\nin cognitive functions and information processing and is involved in many brain\ndisorders and neurodegenerative diseases. An important process in neuron-glia\ncommunications is astrocyte encoding of synaptic information transfer: the\nmodulation of intracellular calcium dynamics in astrocytes in response to\nsynaptic activity. Here, we derive and investigate a concise mathematical model\nfor glutamate-induced astrocytic intracellular Ca2+ dynamics that captures the\nessential biochemical features of the regulatory pathway of inositol\n1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). Starting from the well-known two-state Li-Rinzel\nmodel for calcium-induced-calcium release, we incorporate the regulation of the\nIP3 production and phosphorylation. Doing so we extended it to a three-state\nmodel (referred as the G-ChI model), that could account for Ca2+ oscillations\ntriggered by endogenous IP3 metabolism as well as by IP3 production by external\nglutamate signals. Compared to previous similar models, our three-state models\ninclude a more realistic description of the IP3 production and degradation\npathways, lumping together their essential nonlinearities within a concise\nformulation. Using bifurcation analysis and time simulations, we demonstrate\nthe existence of new putative dynamical features. The cross-couplings between\nIP3 and Ca2+ pathways endows the system with self-consistent oscillator\nproperties and favor mixed frequency-amplitude encoding modes over pure\namplitude modulation ones. These and additional results of our model are in\ngeneral agreement with available experimental data and may have important\nimplications on the role of astrocytes in the synaptic transfer of information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2009 05:51:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-17"}

Since virtually all\ncells employ a network of biochemical reactions for Ca2+ signalling, much\neffort has been devoted to understand the functional role of Ca2+ responses and\nto decipher how their complex dynamics is regulated by the biochemical network\nof Ca2+-related signal transduction pathways. Experimental observations show\nthat Ca2+ signals in response to external stimuli encode information via\nfrequency modulation or alternatively via amplitude modulation. Although\nminimal models can capture separately both types of dynamics, they fail to\nexhibit different and more advanced encoding modes. By arguments of bifurcation\ntheory, we propose instead that under some biophysical conditions more complex\nmodes of information encoding can also be manifested by minimal models. We\nconsider the minimal model of Li and Rinzel and show that information encoding\ncan occur by amplitude modulation (AM) of Ca2+ oscillations, by frequency\nmodulation (FM) or by both modes (AFM). Our work is motivated by calcium\nsignalling in astrocytes, the predominant type of cortical glial cells that is\nnowadays recognized to play a crucial role in the regulation of neuronal\nactivity and information processing of the brain.

More\ninterestingly, we also study the large deviations rate function associated with\ntwo constraints (and the extension to any number of constraints is conceptually\nstraightforward). The phase diagram of this rate function is shown to exhibit\nas many as seven phases, and it suggests a two--dimensional generalization of\nthe notion of BEC (or more generally, a multi--dimensional BEC). While the\nresults are illustrated for a simple model, the underlying principles are\nactually rather general. We also discuss several applications and implications\npertaining to information system models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2009 07:49:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

No dark sector is required to obtain boosted annihilation cross\nsections. A mild hierarchy between the radion and DM masses can be natural due\nto the pseudo-Goldstone boson nature of the radion. Implications of Sommerfeld\nenhancement in warped grand unified theory (GUT) models, where proton stability\nimplies a DM candidate, are studied.

Compared with a traditional MVNO who often leases spectrum via\nlong-term contracts, a C-MVNO can acquire spectrum dynamically in short-term by\nboth sensing the empty \"spectrum holes\" of licensed bands and dynamically\nleasing from the spectrum owner. As a result, a C-MVNO can make flexible\ninvestment and pricing decisions to match the current demands of the secondary\nunlicensed users. Compared to dynamic spectrum leasing, spectrum sensing is\ntypically cheaper, but the obtained useful spectrum amount is random due to\nprimary licensed users' stochastic traffic. The C-MVNO needs to determine the\noptimal amounts of spectrum sensing and leasing by evaluating the trade off\nbetween cost and uncertainty. The C-MVNO also needs to determine the optimal\nprice to sell the spectrum to the secondary unlicensed users, taking into\naccount wireless heterogeneity of users such as different maximum transmission\npower levels and channel gains. We model and analyze the interactions between\nthe C-MVNO and secondary unlicensed users as a Stackelberg game. We show\nseveral interesting properties of the network equilibrium, including threshold\nstructures of the optimal investment and pricing decisions, the independence of\nthe optimal price on users' wireless characteristics, and guaranteed fair and\npredictable QoS among users. We prove that these properties hold for general\nSNR regime and general continuous distributions of sensing uncertainty. We show\nthat spectrum sensing can significantly improve the C-MVNO's expected profit\nand users' payoffs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2009 09:58:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2009 06:10:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 2010 04:22:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

We compare the slope of the bright galaxy counts with the Two Micron\nAll Sky Survey (2MASS) and other counts from the literature and explore the\nrelationship between slope and supergalactic latitude. The slope near the\nsupergalactic equator is sub- Euclidean on average pointing to the possibility\nof a decreasing average space density of galaxies by ~ 10-15% over scales of ~\n250-350 Mpc. On the contrary, the slope at high supergalactic latitudes is\nstrongly super-Euclidean on average suggesting an increase in the space density\nof galaxies as one moves from the voids just above and below the supergalactic\nplane out to distances of ~ 250-350 Mpc.

In combination with already published data,\nthis provides one of the most complete studies of optical and NIR data for any\ntype IIP SN from just after explosion to +500 days. The contribution of the NIR\nflux to the bolometric light curve is estimated to increase from 15% at\nexplosion to around 50% at the end of the plateau and then declines to 40% at\n300 days. SN 2004et is one of the most luminous IIP SNe which has been well\nstudied, and with a luminosity of log L = 42.3 erg/s, it is 2 times brighter\nthan SN 1999em. We provide parametrised bolometric corrections as a function of\ntime for SN 2004et and three other IIP SNe that have extensive optical and NIR\ndata, which can be used as templates for future events. We compare the physical\nparameters of SN 2004et with those of other IIP SNe and find kinetic energies\nspanning the range of 10^50-10^51 ergs. We compare the ejected masses\ncalculated from hydrodynamic models with the progenitor masses and limits\nderived from prediscovery images. Some of the ejected mass estimates are\nsignificantly higher than the progenitor mass estimates, with SN 2004et showing\nperhaps the most serious mass discrepancy. With current models, it appears\ndifficult to reconcile 100 day plateau lengths and high expansion velocities\nwith the low ejected masses of 5-6 Msun implied from 7-8 Msun progenitors. The\nnebular phase is studied using very late time HST photometry, along with\noptical and NIR spectroscopy. The light curve shows a clear flattening at 600\ndays in the optical and the NIR, which is likely due to the ejecta impacting on\nthe CSM.

We present original\nAMR calculations including magnetic field (in the ideal MHD limit) and\nradiative transfer, within the Flux Limited Diffusion approximation, of the\ncollapse of a 1 solar mass dense core. We compare the results with calculations\nperformed with a barotropic EOS. We show that radiative transfer has an\nimportant impact on the collapse and the fragmentation, through the cooling or\nheating of the gas, and is complementary of the magnetic field. A larger field\nyields a stronger magnetic braking, increasing the accretion rate and thus the\neffect of the radiative feedback. Even for a strongly magnetized core, where\nthe dynamics of the collapse is dominated by the magnetic field, radiative\ntransfer is crucial to determine the temperature and optical depth\ndistributions, two potentially accessible observational diagnostics. A\nbarotropic EOS cannot account for realistic fragmentation. The diffusivity of\nthe numerical scheme, however, is found to strongly affect the output of the\ncollapse, leading eventually to spurious fragmentation. Both radiative transfer\nand magnetic field must be included in numerical calculations of star formation\nto obtain realistic collapse configurations and observable signatures.\nNevertheless, the numerical resolution and the robustness of the solver are of\nprime importance to obtain reliable results.

Shear stress, as temperature,\nfavors the fluid-like state, and must be also considered to define the system\n'jamming phase diagram' [1-4]. Frictionless athermal systems [1], for instance,\ncan be described by the zero temperature plane of the jamming diagram in the\ntemperature, density, stress space. Here we consider the jamming of athermal\nfrictional systems [8-13] such as granular materials, which are important to a\nnumber of applications from geophysics to industry. At constant volume and\napplied shear stress[1, 2], we show that while in absence of friction a system\nis either fluid-like or jammed, in the presence of friction a new region in the\ndensity shear-stress plane appears, where new dynamical regimes are found. In\nthis region a system may slip, or even flow with a steady velocity for a long\ntime in response to an applied stress, but then eventually jams.

This is then followed by a period of\ninflow of nebular gas directly onto the growing planet. The core accretion\nmodel has an Achilles heel, namely the very first step. We have undertaken the\nmost comprehensive study of this process to date. In this study we numerically\nintegrate the orbits of a number of planetary embryos embedded in a swarm of\nplanetesimals. In these experiments we have included: 1) aerodynamic gas drag,\n2) collisional damping between planetesimals, 3) enhanced embryo cross-sections\ndue to their atmospheres, 4) planetesimal fragmentation, and 5) planetesimal\ndriven migration. We find that the gravitational interaction between the\nembryos and the planetesimals lead to the wholesale redistribution of material\n- regions are cleared of material and gaps open near the embryos. Indeed, in\n90% of our simulations without fragmentation, the region near that embryos is\ncleared of planetesimals before much growth can occur. The remaining 10%,\nhowever, the embryos undergo a burst of outward migration that significantly\nincreases growth. On timescales of ~100,000 years, the outer embryo can migrate\n~6 AU and grow to roughly 30 Earth-masses.

Can we derive constraints on this issue from the\nanalysis of the main sequence width and from its luminosity function? We build\nup new models for the turnoff masses and the main sequence down to the hydrogen\nburning minimum mass, adopting two versions of an updated equation of state\n(EOS) including the OPAL EOS. Models consider different initial helium and CNO\nabundances to cover the range of possible variations between the first and\nsecond generation stars. We compare the models with the observational main\nsequence. We also make simulations of the theoretical luminosity functions, for\ndifferent choices of the mass function and of the mixture of first and second\ngeneration stars, and compare them with the observed luminosity function, by\nmeans of the Kolmogorov Smirnov --KS-- test. The study of the width of the main\nsequence at different interval of magnitude is consistent with the hypothesis\nthat both generations are present in the cluster. If the CNO increase suggested\nby spectroscopic observation is taken into account the small helium spread of\nthe main sequence in NGC 6397 implies a substantial helium uniformity (DY~0.02)\nbetween first and second generation stars.

We first show that the problem is equivalent to the study of the\nfluctuations of some Birkhoff sums. Then we use general results from\nprobability theory as the weak invariance principle and random change of time\nto get our main theorem. Our method also applies to conformal repellers and\nAxiom A surface diffeomorphisms and possibly to a class of one-dimensional non\nuniformly expanding maps. These generalizations are presented at the end of the\npaper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2009 15:41:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-17"}

We aim to identify which of\nthe candidate members of the Haumea collisional family are true members, by\nsearching for water ice on their surfaces. We also attempt to test the theory\nthat the family members are made of almost pure water ice by using optical\nlight-curves to constrain their densities. We use optical and near-infrared\nphotometry to identify water ice, in particular using the (J - H_S) colour as a\nsensitive measure of the absorption feature at 1.6 micron. We use the CH_4\nfilter of the new Hawk-I instrument at the VLT as a short H-band (H_S) for this\nas it is more sensitive to the water ice feature than the usual H filter. We\nreport colours for 22 candidate family members, including NIR colours for 15.\nWe confirm that 2003 SQ317 and 2005 CB79 are family members, bringing the total\nnumber of confirmed family members to 10. We reject 8 candidates as having no\nwater ice absorption based on our Hawk-I measurements, and 5 more based on\ntheir optical colours. The combination of the large proportion of rejected\ncandidates and time lost to weather prevent us from putting strong constraints\non the density of the family members based on the light-curves obtained so far;\nwe can still say that none of the family members (except Haumea) require a\nlarge density to explain their light-curve.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2009 15:53:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}
