Using positions of haloes above a given mass as node\ntracers, we look for filaments between them using the positions and masses of\nall the remaining dark-matter haloes. In order to detect a filament, the first\nstep consists in the construction of a backbone linking two nodes, which is\ngiven by a skeleton-like path connecting the highest local dark matter (DM)\ndensity traced by non-node haloes. The filament quality is defined by a density\nand gap parameters characterising its skeleton, and filament members are\nselected by their binding energy in the plane perpendicular to the filament.\nThis membership condition is associated to characteristic orbital times;\nhowever if one assumes a fixed orbital timescale for all the filaments, the\nresulting filament properties show only marginal changes, indicating that the\nuse of dynamical information is not critical for the method.

In this paper, we attempt to fill this gap in the literature\nby analyzing the behavior of $k$-means on well-clustered data. In particular,\nwe study the case when each cluster is distributed as a different Gaussian --\nor, in other words, when the input comes from a mixture of Gaussians.\n  We analyze three aspects of the $k$-means algorithm under this assumption.\nFirst, we show that when the input comes from a mixture of two spherical\nGaussians, a variant of the 2-means algorithm successfully isolates the\nsubspace containing the means of the mixture components. Second, we show an\nexact expression for the convergence of our variant of the 2-means algorithm,\nwhen the input is a very large number of samples from a mixture of spherical\nGaussians. Our analysis does not require any lower bound on the separation\nbetween the mixture components.\n  Finally, we study the sample requirement of $k$-means; for a mixture of 2\nspherical Gaussians, we show an upper bound on the number of samples required\nby a variant of 2-means to get close to the true solution. The sample\nrequirement grows with increasing dimensionality of the data, and decreasing\nseparation between the means of the Gaussians. To match our upper bound, we\nshow an information-theoretic lower bound on any algorithm that learns mixtures\nof two spherical Gaussians; our lower bound indicates that in the case when the\noverlap between the probability masses of the two distributions is small, the\nsample requirement of $k$-means is {\\em near-optimal}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2009 19:10:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-02"}

Such detections will provide the means to study\ncosmological evolution and accretion processes associated with these gargantuan\ncompact objects. More generally, the observations will enable testing general\nrelativity in the strong, nonlinear regime and will provide independent\ncosmological measurements to high precision. Understanding the conditions under\nwhich coincidences of EM and GW signatures arise during supermassive black hole\nmergers is therefore of paramount importance. As an essential step towards this\ngoal, we present results from the first fully general relativistic,\nhydrodynamical study of the late inspiral and merger of equal-mass, spinning\nsupermassive black hole binaries in a gas cloud. We find that variable EM\nsignatures correlated with GWs can arise in merging systems as a consequence of\nshocks and accretion combined with the effect of relativistic beaming. The most\nstriking EM variability is observed for systems where spins are aligned with\nthe orbital axis and where orbiting black holes form a stable set of density\nwakes, but all systems exhibit some characteristic signatures that can be\nutilized in searches for EM counterparts.

The Standard Model\n(SM) plus gravity could be valid up to arbitrarily high energies. Supposing\nthat this is indeed the case and assuming that there are no intermediate energy\nscales between the Fermi and Planck scales we address the question of whether\nthe mass of the Higgs boson $m_H$ can be predicted. For a positive gravity\ninduced anomalous dimension $A_\\lambda>0$ the running of the quartic scalar\nself interaction $\\lambda$ at scales beyond the Planck mass is determined by a\nfixed point at zero. This results in $m_H=m_{\\rm min}=126$ GeV, with only a few\nGeV uncertainty. This prediction is independent of the details of the short\ndistance running and holds for a wide class of extensions of the SM as well.\nFor $A_\\lambda <0$ one finds $m_H$ in the interval $m_{\\rm min}< m_H < m_{\\rm\nmax}\\simeq 174$ GeV, now sensitive to $A_\\lambda$ and other properties of the\nshort distance running. The case $A_\\lambda>0$ is favored by explicit\ncomputations existing in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2009 17:15:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2010 15:09:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-07"}

As a result we obtain that, for large diffusion times, the quantum\nspacetime behaves like a smooth differential manifold of discrete dimension. On\nthe other hand, for smaller diffusion times, the spacetime looks like a fractal\nsurface with a reduced effective dimension. For the specific case in which the\ndiffusion time has the size of the minimal length, the spacetime turns out to\nhave a spectral dimension equal to 2, suggesting a possible renormalizable\ncharacter of gravity in this regime. For smaller diffusion times, the spectral\ndimension approaches zero, making any physical interpretation less reliable in\nthis extreme regime. We extend our result to the presence of a background field\nand curvature.

In relaxed clusters\nwith cool cores, these commonly observed edges have been interpreted as\nevidence for the \"sloshing\" of the core gas in the cluster's gravitational\npotential. Such sloshing may provide a source of heat to the cluster core by\nmixing hot gas from the cluster outskirts with the cool core gas. Using\nhigh-resolution $N$-body/Eulerian hydrodynamics simulations, we model gas\nsloshing in galaxy clusters initiated by mergers with subclusters. The\nsimulations include merger scenarios with gas-filled and gasless subclusters.\nThe effect of changing the viscosity of the intracluster medium is also\nexplored. We find that sloshing can facilitate heat inflow to the cluster core,\nprovided that there is a strong enough disturbance. In adiabatic simulations,\nwe find that sloshing can raise the entropy floor of the cluster core by nearly\nan order of magnitude in the strongest cases. If the ICM is viscous, the mixing\nof gases with different entropies is decreased and consequently the heat flux\nto the core is diminished. In simulations where radiative cooling is included,\nwe find that though eventually a cooling flow develops, sloshing can prevent\nthe significant buildup of cool gas in the core for times on the order of a Gyr\nfor small disturbances and a few Gyr for large ones. If repeated encounters\nwith merging subclusters sustain the sloshing of the central core gas as is\nobserved, this process can provide a relatively steady source of heat to the\ncore, which can help to prevent a significant cooling flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2009 19:49:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 15 May 2010 08:58:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 29 Jan 2011 05:18:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

Typically, one considers d\ntending to infinity, with c fixed and q bounded away from 0.\n  For its applications to approximate nearest neighbor search in high\ndimensions, the quality of an LSH family H is governed by how small its \"rho\nparameter\" rho = ln(1/p)/ln(1/q) is as a function of the parameter c. The\nseminal paper of Indyk and Motwani showed that for each c, the extremely simple\nfamily H = {x -> x_i : i in d} achieves rho at most 1/c.

However,\nthis step is not necessary for constraining cosmology with the shear-peak\nabundance, if we are able to predict its amplitude. We generate a large\nensemble of N-body simulations spanning four cosmological models, with total\nvolume V~1 (Gpc/h)^3 per model. Variations to the matter density parameter and\namplitude of fluctuations are considered. We measure the abundance of peaks in\nthe mass density projected in ~100 Mpc/h slabs to determine the impact of\nstructures spatially correlated with the simulation clusters, identified by the\n3D friends-of-friends algorithm. The halo model shows that the choice of the\nsmoothing filter for the density field is important in reducing the\ncontribution of correlated projections to individual halo masses. Such\ncontributions are less than 2% in the case of the optimal, compensated filter\nused throughout this analysis. We measure the change in the mass of peaks when\nprojected in slabs of various thicknesses. Peaks in slabs of 26 Mpc/h and 102\nMpc/h suffer an average mass change of less than 2% compared to their mass in\nslabs of 51 Mpc/h.

We present optical light curves and spectra of SN 2006bt\nwhich demonstrate the peculiar nature of this object. SN 2006bt has broad,\nslowly declining light curves indicative of a hot, high-luminosity SN, but\nlacks a prominent second maximum in the i band as do low-luminosity SNe Ia. Its\nspectra are similar to those of low-luminosity SNe Ia, containing features that\nare only present in cool SN photospheres. Light-curve fitting methods suggest\nthat SN 2006bt is reddened by a significant amount of dust; however, it\noccurred in the outskirts of its early-type host galaxy and has no strong Na D\nabsorption in any of its spectra, suggesting a negligible amount of host-galaxy\ndust absorption. C II is possibly detected in our pre-maximum spectra, but at a\nmuch lower velocity than other elements. The progenitor was likely very old,\nbeing a member of the halo population of a galaxy that shows no signs of recent\nstar formation. SNe Ia have been very successfully modeled as a one-parameter\nfamily, and this is fundamental to their use as cosmological distance\nindicators. SN 2006bt is a challenge to that picture, yet its relatively normal\nlight curves allowed SN 2006bt to be included in cosmological analyses. We\ngenerate mock SN Ia datasets which indicate that contamination by similar\nobjects will both increase the scatter of a SN Ia Hubble diagram and\nsystematically bias measurements of cosmological parameters. However, spectra\nand rest-frame i-band light curves should provide a definitive way to identify\nand eliminate such objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2009 21:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

We analyze the resolution of the image\nof a line source radiating in the Maxwell fisheye and the Veselago-Pendry slab\nlens. The former optical medium is deduced from the stereographic projection of\na virtual sphere and displays a heterogeneous refractive index n(r) which is\nproportional to the inverse of 1+r^2. The latter is described by a homogeneous,\nbut negative, refractive index. It has been suggested that the fisheye makes a\nperfect lens without negative refraction [Leonhardt, Philbin\narxiv:0805.4778v2]. However, we point out that the definition of\nsuper-resolution in such a heterogeneous medium should be computed with respect\nto the wavelength in a homogenized medium, and it is perhaps more adequate to\ntalk about a conjugate image rather than a perfect image (the former does not\nnecessarily contains the evanescent components of the source). We numerically\nfind that both the Maxwell fisheye and a thick silver slab lens lead to a\nresolution close to lambda/3 in transverse magnetic polarization (electric\nfield pointing orthogonal to the plane). We note a shift of the image plane in\nthe latter lens. We also observe that two sources lead to multiple secondary\nimages in the former lens, as confirmed from light rays travelling along\ngeodesics of the virtual sphere. We further observe resolutions ranging from\nlambda/2 to nearly lambda/4 for magnetic dipoles of varying orientations of\ndipole moments within the fisheye in transverse electric polarization (magnetic\nfield pointing orthogonal to the plane). Finally, we analyse the Eaton lens for\nwhich the source and its image are either located within a unit disc of air, or\nwithin a corona 1<r<2 with refractive index $n(r)=\\sqrt{2/r-1}$. In both cases,\nthe image resolution is about lambda/2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2009 21:17:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2010 16:00:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-03"}

This star formation proceeds according to\nestablished scaling relations with molecular gas content, in surface density\nregimes characteristic of disk galaxies and circumnuclear starbursts. We find\nthat star formation in early-type galaxies happens exclusively in fast-rotating\nsystems and occurs in two distinct modes. In the first, star formation is a\ndiffuse process, corresponding to widespread young stellar populations and high\nmolecular gas content. The equal presence of co- and counter-rotating\ncomponents in these systems strongly implies an external origin for the\nstar-forming gas, and we argue that these star formation events may be the\nfinal stages of (mostly minor) mergers that build up the bulges of red sequence\nlenticulars. In the second mode of star formation, the process is concentrated\ninto well-defined disk or ring morphologies, outside of which the host galaxies\nexhibit uniformly evolved stellar populations. This implies that these star\nformation events represent rejuvenations within previously quiescent stellar\nsystems. Evidence for earlier star formation events similar to these in all\nfast rotating early-type galaxies suggests that this mode of star formation may\nbe common to all such galaxies, with a duty cycle of roughly 1/10, and likely\ncontributes to the embedded, co-rotating inner stellar disks ubiquitous in this\npopulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2009 21:22:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2009 22:23:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Their origin, however, is still poorly understood. When cosmic\nstructures form, they grow in mass via accretion from the surrounding\nenvironment. We propose that this accretion is able to drive internal turbulent\nmotions in a wide range of astrophysical objects and study this process in the\ncase of galaxies, molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks. We use a\ncombination of numerical simulations and analytical arguments to predict the\nlevel of turbulence as a function of the accretion rate, the dissipation scale,\nand the density contrast, and compare with observational data. We find that in\nMilky Way type galaxies the observed level of turbulence in the interstellar\nmedium can be explained by accretion, provided that the galaxies gain mass at a\nrate comparable to the rate at which they form stars. This process is\nparticularly relevant in the extended outer disks beyond the star-forming\nradius. We also calculate the rate at which molecular clouds grow in mass when\nthey build up from the atomic component of the galactic gas and find that their\ninternal turbulence is likely to be driven by accretion as well. It is the very\nprocess of cloud formation that excites turbulent motions on small scales by\nestablishing the turbulent cascade. In the case of T Tauri disks, we show that\naccretion can drive subsonic turbulence at the observed level if the rate at\nwhich gas falls onto the disk is comparable to the rate at which disk material\naccretes onto the central star. This also explains the observed relation of\naccretion rate and stellar mass, dM/dt ~ M^1.8. The efficiency required to\nconvert infall motion into turbulence is of the order of a few percent in all\nthree cases. We conclude that accretion-driven turbulence is a universal\nconcept with far-reaching implications for a wide range of astrophysical\nobjects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2009 22:42:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 May 2010 05:43:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The incidence of tau>=2 LLSs per unit\nredshift, l(z), is well described by a single-power law at these redshifts:\nl(z) = C_LLS [(1+z)/(1+z_*)]^gamma, with z_*=3.7, C_LLS = 1.9+/-0.2, and gamma\n= 5.2+/-1.5 (68% c.l.).

In this context it is important to study supersymmetric\nlarge-N gauge theories in the strongly coupled regime. I will summarize the\nresults and insights obtained so far by non-lattice simulations. A simple\nexample of the gauge-gravity duality is the one between 1d U(N) gauge theory\nwith 16 supercharges and the so-called black 0-brane solution in type IIA\nsupergravity. In order for this duality to be valid, one has to take the 't\nHooft large-N limit and to take the strong coupling limit on the gauge theory\nside. The gauge theory can be regularized by fixing the gauge completely thanks\nto one dimension, and by introducing a Fourier mode cutoff. One can then use\nthe standard RHMC algorithm to simulate the system. The energy calculated as a\nfunction of the temperature was compared with the results obtained from the\ngravity side based on the black hole thermodynamics. This confirmed the\ngauge-gravity duality with high accuracy and provided the microscopic origin of\nthe black hole thermodynamics. From the calculation of the Wilson loop, one\nobtains the Schwarzschild radius of the dual geometry. One can actually use the\npresent 1d model with supersymmetric mass deformation to study \\mathcal{N}=4\nsuper Yang-Mills theory on R \\times S^3 based on a novel large-N reduction,\nwhich generalizes the original idea of Eguchi and Kawai. It is remarkable that\nwe can now simulate the 4d superconformal field theory, which appears in the\nmost typical case of the gauge-gravity duality known as the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence. In particular, no fine-tuning is required unlike previous\nproposals based on the lattice regularization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2009 02:33:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2009 08:26:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2010 05:57:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-05"}

Coronal bright points (BPs) are\nlocal heating phenomena and we found a different Doppler-shift pattern at TR\nand coronal temperatures in one BP, which might be related to the twisted loop\nsystem.

Contrary to local starforming galaxies, where dust re-emits a large part\nof the stellar ultraviolet (UV) light at infrared and sub-millimetre\nwavelengths, our self-consistent modelling of dust extinction predicts that a\nsubstantial fraction of UV photons should escape from primordial galaxies. Such\na model allows us to compute reliably the number of high redshift objects as a\nfunction of luminosity, and yields galaxies whose UV luminosities closely match\nthose measured in the deepest observational surveys available.

A new mechanism\nof decoherence is proposed. The temperature of the environment is supposed to\nbe zero whereas the energy of the incoming particle $E_{in}$ can be close to or\nsomewhat above the Fermi surface in the environment. The single-particle\ndoorway resonance states excited in the structure via external channels are\ndamped not only because of escape through such channels but also due to the\nulterior population of the long-lived environmental states. Transmission of an\nelectron with a given incoming $E_{in}$ through the structure turns out to be\nan incoherent sum of the flow formed by the interfering damped doorway\nresonances and the retarded flow of the particles re-emitted into the structure\nby the environment. Though the number of the particles is conserved in each\nindividual event of transmission, there exists a probability that some part of\nthe electron's energy can be absorbed due to environmental many-body effects.\nIn such a case the electron can disappear from the resonance energy interval\nand elude observation at the fixed transmission energy $E_{in}$ thus resulting\nin seeming loss of particles, violation of the time reversal symmetry and, as a\nconsequence, suppression of the weak localization. The both decoherence and\nabsorption phenomena are treated within the framework of a unit microscopic\nmodel based on the general theory of the resonance scattering.

In the case of the SmFeAs(O1-xFx) series,\nwe find that a single band description allows to extract an approximated\nestimation of band parameters such as carrier density and mobility from\nexperimental data, although the behaviour of Seebeck effect as a function of\ndoping demonstrates that a multiband description would be more appropriate. On\nthe contrary, experimental data of the Fe1+y(Te1-x,Sex) series exhibit a\nstrongly compensated behaviour, which can be described only within a multiband\nmodel. In the Fe1+y(Te1-x,Sex) series, the role of the excess Fe, tuned by Se\nstoichiometry, is found to be twofold: it dopes electrons in the system and it\nintroduces localized magnetic moments, responsible for Kondo like scattering\nand likely pair-breaking of Cooper pairs. Hence, excess Fe plays a crucial role\nalso in determining superconducting properties such as the Tc and the upper\ncritical field Bc2. The huge Bc2 values of the Fe1+y(Te1-x,Sex) samples are\ndescribed by a dirty limit law, opposed to the clean limit behaviour of the\nSmFeAs(O1-xFx) samples. Hence, magnetic scattering by excess Fe seems to drive\nthe system in the dirty regime, but its detrimental pairbreaking role seems not\nto be as severe as predicted by theory. This issue has yet to be clarified,\naddressing the more fundamental issue of the interplay between magnetism and\nsuperconductivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2009 11:38:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Quantitative details\ndepend on properties of the thermal background, which leads to variations in\nthe correlation between HXR flux and spectral index.

The combinations\nof model plus spectral library employed in this investigation are\nGalaxev/STELIB, Vazdekis/MILES, SED@/GRANADA, and Galaxev/MILES+GRANADA, which\nprovide a representative sample of models currently available for spectral\nfitting work.

A comparison is also made between\nthe properties derived from these spectral fits and literature data on these\nnearby, well studied clusters.

We find that new generation of models using the GRANADA and\nMILES libraries are superior to STELIB-based models both in terms of spectral\nfit quality and regarding the accuracy with which age and metallicity are\nretrieved.

The German philosopher Immanuel Kant recommended\nbetting at such controversial questions, and Stephen Hawking announced a $100\nbet against the Higgs.

We look at the second and third order\nstatistics at large scales of the (intermediate) MICEL1536 simulation and also\nmeasure directly the local bias relation h = f({\\delta}) between DM\nfluctuations, {\\delta}, smoothed over a top-hat radius Rs at a point in the\nsimulation and its corresponding tracer h (i.e. halos) at the same point. This\nlocal relation can be Taylor expanded to define a linear (b1) and non-linear\n(b2) bias parameters. The values of b1 and b2 in the simulation vary with Rs\napproaching a constant value around Rs > 30 - 60 Mpc/h. We use the local\nrelation to predict the clustering of the tracer in terms of the one of DM.\nThis prediction works very well (about percent level) for the halo 2-point\ncorrelation {\\xi}(r_12) for r_12 > 15 Mpc/h, but only when we use the biasing\nvalues that we found at very large smoothing radius Rs > 30 - 60 Mpc/h. We find\nno effect from stochastic or next to leading order terms in the f({\\delta})\nexpansion. But we do find some discrepancies in the 3-point function that needs\nfurther understanding. We also look at the clustering of the smoothed moments,\nthe variance and skewness which are volume average correlations and therefore\ninclude clustering from smaller scales. In this case, we find that both next to\nleading order and discreetness corrections (to the local model) are needed at\nthe 10 - 20% level. Shot-noise can be corrected with a term {\\sigma}e^2/n where\n{\\sigma}e^2 < 1, i.e., always smaller than the Poisson correction. We also\ncompare these results with the peak-background split predictions from the\nmeasured halo mass function. We find 5-10% systematic (and similar statistical)\nerrors in the mass estimation when we use the halo model biasing predictions to\ncalibrate the mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2009 15:45:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 17 Apr 2010 04:24:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 21 Oct 2010 20:26:05 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2011 10:33:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}
