Both theoretical and observational\nstudies support the hypothesis that such bodies emit significant amounts of\nflux relative to the host star, increasing towards infrared wavelengths. For\nthe dayside of the exoplanet, this phenomenon typically permits detectable\nsecondary eclipses at such wavelengths, which may be used to infer atmospheric\ncomposition. In this paper, we explore the effects of emission from the\nnightside of the exoplanet on the primary transit lightcurve, which is\nessentially a self-blend. Allowing for nightside emission, an exoplanet's\ntransit depth is no longer exclusively a function of the ratio-of-radii. The\nnightside of an exoplanet is emitting flux and the contrast to the star's\nemission is of the order of ~10^(-3) for hot-Jupiters. Consequently, we show\nthat the transit depth in the mid-infrared will be attenuated due to flux\ncontribution from the nightside emission by ~10^(-4). We show how this effect\ncan be compensated for in the case where exoplanet phase curves have been\nmeasured, in particular for HD 189733b. For other systems, it may be possible\nto make a first-order correction by using temperature estimates of the planet.\nUnless the effect is accounted for, transmission spectra will also be polluted\nby nightside emission and we estimate that a Spitzer broadband spectrum on a\nbright target is altered at the 1-sigma level. Using archived Spitzer\nmeasurements, we show that the effect respectively increases the 8.0um and\n24.0um transit depths by 1-sigma and 0.5-sigma per transit for HD 189733b.\nConsequently, we estimate that this would be 5-10 sigma effect for near-future\nJWST observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Dec 2009 20:55:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 May 2010 00:58:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-07"}

Our theoretical MMRD relations\nare governed by two parameters, one is the white dwarf (WD) mass and the other\nis the initial envelope mass at a nova outburst; this second parameter explains\nthe scatter of MMRD points of individual novae. Our theoretical MMRD relations\nare also in good agreement with the well-known empirical formulae.

The extremely low turbulence could be the reason for the strong\ndepletion of this core despite its relatively low density and opacity in\ncontrast with undepleted cores such as L1521E which shows a turbulence at least\n4 times as high.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2009 10:18:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Program packages have been developed for a spatially variable PSF, but\nthey require that a sufficient number of bright, isolated stars in the image\nare present to adequately sample the PSF. Imaging the Galactic center is\nparticularly challenging. We present two ways of dealing with spatially\nvariable PSFs when only one or very few suitable PSF reference stars are\npresent in the field. Local PSF fitting with the StarFinder algorithm is\napplied to the data. Satisfying results can be found in two ways: (a) creating\nlocal PSFs by merging locally extracted PSF cores with the PSF wings estimated\nfrom the brightest star in the field; (b) Wiener deconvolution of the image\nwith the PSF estimated from the brightest star in the field and subsequent\nestimation of local PSFs on the deconvolved image. The methodology is tested on\nreal, and on artificial images. The method involving Wiener deconvolution of\nthe image prior to local PSF extraction and fitting gives excellent results. It\nlimits systematic effects to ~2-5% in point source photometry and ~10% in\ndiffuse emission on fields-of-view as large as 28\" x 28\" and observed through\nthe H-band filter. Particular attention is given to how deconvolution changes\nthe noise properties of the image. It is shown that mean positions and fluxes\nof the stars are conserved by the deconvolution. However, the estimated\nuncertainties of the PSF fitting algorithm are too small if the presence of\ncovariances is ignored in the PSF fitting as has been done here. An appropriate\nscaling factor can, however, be determined from simulated images or by\ncomparing measurements on independent data sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2009 12:45:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-08"}

In the L^2-critical and supercritical cases, we use asymptotic\nanalysis and numerical simulations to characterize singular solutions with a\npeak-type self-similar collapsing core.

While there is\nobservational evidence to suggest that the outflows are originating in the\nmagnetic field surrounding the active regions, there is no conclusive evidence\nthat reveals how they are driven. Motivated by observations of outflows at the\nperiphery of a mature active region embedded in a coronal hole, we have used a\nthree-dimensional simulation to emulate the active region's development in\norder to investigate the origin and driver of these outflows. We find outflows\nare accelerated from a site in the coronal hole magnetic field immediately\nsurrounding the active region and are channelled along the coronal hole field\nas they rise through the atmosphere. The plasma is accelerated simply as a\nresult of the active region expanding horizontally as it develops. Many of the\ncharacteristics of the outflows generated in the simulation are consistent with\nthose of observed outflows: velocities up to 45 km per sec, properties akin to\nthe coronal hole, proximity to the active region's draining loops, expansion\nwith height, and projection over monopolar photospheric magnetic\nconcentrations. Although the horizontal expansion occurs as a consequence of\nthe active region's development in the simulation, expansion is also a general\nfeature of established active regions. Hence, it is entirely possible and\nplausible that the expansion acceleration mechanism displayed in the simulation\nis occurring in active regions on the Sun and, in addition to reconnection, is\ndriving the outflows observed at their edges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2009 14:15:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

A comparison of theory and experiment allows us\nto extract temperature dependence of quantum lifetime of electrons and to\nconfirm the applicability of the inelastic mechanism of microwave\nphotoresistance for the description of magnetotransport in multilayer systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2009 14:34:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-08"}

This potential, dominated by a\nlinear potential at moderate distances, is consistent with the confinement with\na flux tube, an extended and scalar system also directly observable in lattice\nQCD. Quantized flux tubes have also been observed in another class of\nconfinement, the magnetic confinement in type II superconductors. On the other\nhand the solution of Schwinger Dyson Equations, say with the Landau gauge\nfixing and the truncation of the series of Feynman diagrams, already at the\nrainbow level for the self energy and at the ladder level for the Bethe\nSalpeter equation, provides a signal of a possible inverse quartic potential in\nmomentum space derived from one gluon and one ghost exchange, consistent with\nconfinement. Here we address the successes, difficulties and open problems of\nthe matching of these two different perspectives of confinement, the\nSchwinger-Dyson perspective versus the flux tube perspective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2009 15:41:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-14"}
