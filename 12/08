The\ncontemporaneous detection of the optically thin part of the compact jet and the\nX-ray tail above 30 keV allows us to assess the contribution of the jet to the\nhard X-ray tail by synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) processes. We conclude that,\nfor realistic jet size, boosting, viewing angle and energy partition, the SSC\nemission alone, from the post-shock, accelerated, non-thermal population in the\njet, is not a viable mechanism to explain the observed hard X-ray tail of the\nneutron star 4U0614+091.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2009 17:17:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

We consider the effect on both the mass accretion and the\nmigration history as a function of encounter distance. We use a grid-based\nhydrodynamics code to perform 2D simulations of a system consisting of a giant\nplanet embedded within a gaseous disc orbiting around a star, which is\nperturbed by a passing star on a prograde, parabolic orbit. The disc model\nextends out to 50 AU, and parabolic encounters are considered with impact\nparameters ranging from 100 - 250 AU. In agreement with previous work, we find\nthat the disc is significantly tidally truncated for encounters < 150 AU, and\nthe removal of angular momentum from the disc by the passing star causes a\nsubstantial inflow of gas through the disc. The gap formed by the embedded\nplanet becomes flooded with gas, causing the gas accretion rate onto the planet\nto increase abruptly. Gas flow through the gap, and into the inner disc, causes\nthe positive inner disc torques exerted on the planet to increase, resulting in\na sustained period of outward migration. For weaker interactions, corresponding\nto an encounter distance of > 250 AU, we find that the planet-disc system\nexperiences minimal perturbation. Our results indicate that stellar fly-bys in\nyoung clusters may significantly modify the masses and orbital parameters of\ngiant planets forming within protostellar discs. Planets that undergo such\nencounters are expected to be more massive, and to orbit with larger semimajor\naxes, than planets in systems which have not experienced parabolic encounters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2009 18:16:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Three clusters obtained from state-of-the-art\nhydrodynamical simulations, each of which has been projected along three\nindependent lines-of-sight, are used for this analysis.

Using non-parametric methods which combine weak and strong\nlensing data, the projected masses within R200 can be constrained with a\nprecision of ~10%. De-projection of lensing masses increases the scatter around\nthe true masses by more than a factor of two due to cluster triaxiality. X-ray\nmass measurements have much smaller scatter (about a factor of two smaller than\nthe lensing masses) but they are generally biased low by 5-20%. This bias is\nascribable to bulk motions in the gas of our simulated clusters.

The scattering of a significant\nfraction of the Lyalpha emission to the observed radii, which can be as large\nas 50 kpc or more, requires the amplitude of the bulk motions of the gas at the\ncentre of the halos to be moderate.

The Fourier transform (FT) of an image contains a\ncomplete description of the image, and the values of the FT coefficients are\nuniquely associated with that image. For an image where the distribution of\npixels is uncorrelated, the FT coefficients are normally distributed and\nuncorrelated. Further, the probability distribution for the FT coefficients of\nsuch an image can readily be obtained by Parseval's theorem. We take advantage\nof these properties to compute the spatial information in an image by\ndetermining the probability of each coefficient (both real and imaginary parts)\nin the FT, then using the Shannon formalism to calculate information. By using\nthe probability distribution obtained from Parseval's theorem, an effective\ndistance from the completely uncorrelated or most uncertain case is obtained.\nThe resulting quantity is an information computed in k-space (kSI). This\napproach provides a robust, facile and highly flexible framework for\nquantifying spatial information in images and other types of data (of arbitrary\ndimensions). The kSI metric is tested on a 2D Ising ferromagnet, and the\ntemperature-dependent phase transition is accurately determined from the\nspatial information in configurations of the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2009 02:06:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-09"}

Understanding its spreading dynamics is of fundamental\nimportance for both public health and scientific researches. Recent studies\nhave focused mainly on evaluation and prediction of on-going spreading, which\nstrongly depends on detailed information about the structure of social\ncontacts, human traveling patterns and biological activity of virus, etc.\n  Methodology/Principal Findings: In this work we analyzed the distributions of\nconfirmed cases of influenza A (H1N1) in different levels and find the Zipf's\nlaw and Heaps' law. Similar scaling properties were also observed for severe\nacute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and bird cases of H5N1. We also found a\nhierarchical spreading pattern from countries with larger population and GDP to\ncountries with smaller ones. We proposed a model that considers generic control\neffects on both the local growth and transregional transmission, without the\nneed of the above mentioned detailed information. We studied in detail the\nimpact of control effects and heterogeneity on the spreading dynamics in the\nmodel and showed that they are responsible for the scaling and hierarchical\nspreading properties observed in empirical data.\n  Conclusions/Significance: Our analysis and modeling showed that although\nstrict control measures for interregional travelers could delay the outbreak in\nthe regions without local cases, the focus should be turned to local prevention\nafter the outbreak of local cases. Target control on a few regions with the\nlargest number of active interregional travelers can efficiently prevent the\nspreading. This work provided not only a deeper understanding of the generic\nmechanisms underlying the spread of infectious diseases, but also some\npractical guidelines for decision makers to adopt suitable control strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2009 02:37:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Jan 2011 01:59:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

Recent work has focused on idealized cases of stick-perfect slip\nstripes, with limited guidance. Here, we analyze the experimentally relevant\nsituation of a pressure-driven flow past striped slip-stick surfaces with\narbitrary local slip at the gas sectors. We derive analytical formulas for\nmaximal (longitudinal) and minimal (transverse) directional effective slip\nlengths that can be used for any surface slip fraction (validated by numerical\ncalculations). By representing eigenvalues of the slip length-tensor, they\nallow us to obtain the effective slip for any orientation of stripes with\nrespect to the mean flow. Our results imply that flow past stripes is\ncontrolled by the ratio of the local slip length to texture size. In case of a\nlarge (compared to the texture period) slip at the gas areas, surface\nanisotropy leads to a tensorial effective slip, by attaining the values\npredicted earlier for a perfect local slip. Both effective slip lengths and\nanisotropy of the flow decrease when local slip becomes of the order of texture\nperiod. In the case of small slip, we predict simple surface-averaged,\nisotropic flows (independent of orientation).

However, the\namplitude and angular direction of the effect is not necessarily the same as\nthose of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) dipole anisotropy due to the\ngrowth of cosmic structures. In other words exploring the aberration effect may\ngive us a clue to the horizon-scale physics perhaps related to the cosmic\nacceleration. In this paper we develop a method to explore the dipole angular\nmodulation from the pixelized galaxy data on the sky properly taking into\naccount the covariances due to the shot noise and the intrinsic galaxy\nclustering contamination as well as the partial sky coverage. We applied the\nmethod to the galaxy catalogs constructed from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\n(SDSS) Data Release 6 data. After constructing the four galaxy catalogs that\nare different in the ranges of magnitudes and photometric redshifts to study\npossible systematics, we found that the most robust sample against systematics\nindicates no dipole anisotropy in the galaxy distribution. This finding is\nconsistent with the expectation from the concordance Lambda-dominated cold dark\nmatter model. Finally we argue that an almost full-sky galaxy survey such as\nLSST may allow for a significant detection of the aberration effect of the CMB\ndipole having the precision of constraining the angular direction to ~ 20\ndegrees in radius. Assuming a hypothetical LSST galaxy survey, we find that\nthis method can confirm or reject the result implied from a stacked analysis of\nthe kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect of X-ray luminous clusters in Kashlinsky\net al.

The\ncase of a two-dimensional (2d) Bose fluid is particularly fascinating because\nof its \"marginal\" behaviour. In an infinite uniform 2d fluid thermal\nfluctuations at any non-zero temperature are strong enough to destroy the fully\nordered state associated with Bose--Einstein condensation, but are not strong\nenough to suppress superfluidity in an interacting system at low, but non-zero\ntemperatures. Further, the presence of residual \"quasi-long-range\" order at low\ntemperatures leads to an interesting interplay between superfluidity and\ncondensation in all experimentally relevant finite-size systems.

Yet, no stars have been positively\nidentified in this key evolutionary phase, mainly for two reasons: first, this\npre-ZAHB phase is very short compared to other major evolutionary phases in the\nlife of a star; and second, these pre-ZAHB stars are expected to overlap the\nloci occupied by asymptotic giant branch (AGB), HB and RGB stars observed in\nthe color-magnitude diagram (CMD).

Aims: Here we develop a\nmethod for nonlinear force-free coronal magnetic field medelling and\npreprocessing of photospheric vector magnetograms in spherical geometry using\nthe optimization procedure. Methods: We describe a newly developed code for the\nextrapolation of nonlinear force-free coronal magnetic fields in spherical\ncoordinates over a restricted area of the Sun. The program uses measured vector\nmagnetograms on the solar photosphere as input and solves the force-free\nequations in the solar corona. We develop a preprocessing procedure in\nspherical geometry to drive the observed non-force-free data towards suitable\nboundary conditions for a force-free extrapolation. Results: We test the code\nwith the help of a semi-analytic solution and assess the quality of our\nreconstruction qualitatively by magnetic field line plots and quantitatively\nwith a number of comparison metrics for different boundary conditions. The\nreconstructed fields from the lower boundary data with the weighting function\nare in good agreement with the original reference fields. We added artificial\nnoise to the boundary conditions and tested the code with and without\npreprocessing. The preprocessing recovered all main structures of the\nmagnetogram and removed small-scale noise.

Recent\nprogress in metrology exploits so-called \"magic wavelengths,\" whereby an atomic\nensemble can be trapped with laser light whose wavelength is chosen so that\nboth levels of an optical atomic transition experience identical ac Stark\nshifts. Similar magic-wavelength techniques are not possible for the microwave\nhyperfine transitions in the alkalis, due to their simple electronic structure.\nWe show, however, that ac Stark shift cancellation is indeed achievable for\ncertain values of wavelength, polarization, and magnetic field. The\ncancellation comes at the expense of a small magnetic-field sensitivity. The\ntechnique demonstrated here has implications for experiments involving the\nprecise control of optically-trapped neutral atoms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2009 15:51:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2009 05:06:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2010 20:39:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-09"}
