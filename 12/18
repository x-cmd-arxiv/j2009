The Risager expansion is known to recursively construct\nthe CSW expansion for all tree amplitudes, and given that the CSW expansion\nfollows directly from the (super) Yang-Mills Lagrangian in light-cone gauge,\nthis contour deformation allows us to directly see the emergence of local\nspace-time physics from the Grassmannian.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2009 20:53:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Dec 2010 20:29:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-28"}

Combining\na stochastic model (conveying all possible journeys) and an analysis of the\ndurations of the nodes' encounters, we study the properties of journeys that\nmaximize the space-time information propagation capacity, in bit-meters per\nsecond. More specifically, we provide theoretical lower and upper bounds on the\ninformation propagation speed, as a function of the journey capacity. In the\nparticular case of random way-point-like models (i.e., when nodes move for a\ndistance of the order of the network domain size before changing direction), we\nshow that, for relatively large journey capacities, the information propagation\nspeed is of the same order as the mobile node speed. This implies that,\nsurprisingly, in sparse but large-scale mobile DTNs, the space-time information\npropagation capacity in bit-meters per second remains proportional to the\nmobile node speed and to the size of the transported data bundles, when the\nbundles are relatively large. We also verify that all our analytical bounds are\naccurate in several simulation scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2009 16:27:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

Fewer colors create fewer independent sets which in turn\nimply higher concurrency potential for a network. Since PPI networks tend to be\ndisassortative, we suggest that in addition to functional specificity and\nstability proposed previously by Maslov and Sneppen (Science 296, 2002), the\ndisassortative nature of PPI networks may promote the ability of cells to\nperform multiple, crucial and functionally diverse tasks concurrently.

The proposed algorithm is an instance of the\nso-called \"alternating direction method of multipliers\", for which convergence\nsufficient conditions are known; we show that these conditions are satisfied by\nthe proposed algorithm. Experiments on a set of image restoration and\nreconstruction benchmark problems show that the proposed algorithm is a strong\ncontender for the state-of-the-art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2009 18:32:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-10"}

Uniform distributions of the\nendpoint inside a ball of radius l were evidenced for a walk of three steps in\n2D and of two steps in 4D. The previous walk is generalized by considering step\nlengths which are distributed over the unit (n-1) simplex according to a\nDirichlet distribution whose parameters are all equal to q, a given positive\nvalue. The walk and the flight above correspond to q=1. For any d >= 3, there\nexist, for integer and half-integer values of q, two families of\nPearson-Dirichlet walks which share a common property.

Applying a mask filtering\nalgorithm to the color-magnitude diagrams of the observed stars, we sorted\ncluster's member star candidates that are used to examine the characteristics\nof the spatial stellar distribution surrounding the target clusters. The\nsmoothed surface density maps and the overlaid isodensity contours indicate\nthat all of the five metal-poor globular clusters exhibit strong evidence of\nextratidal overdensity features over their tidal radii, in the form of extended\ntidal tails around the clusters. The orientations of the observed extratidal\nfeatures show signatures of tidal tails tracing the clusters' orbits, inferred\nfrom their proper motions, and effects of dynamical interactions with the\nGalaxy. Our findings include detections of a tidal bridge-like feature and an\nenvelope structure around the pair of globular clusters M53 and NGC 5053. The\nobserved radial surface density profiles of target clusters have a deviation\nfrom theoretical King models, for which the profiles show a break at\n0.5~0.7r_t, extending the overdensity features out to 1.5~2r_t. Both radial\nsurface density profiles for different angular sections and azimuthal number\ndensity profiles confirm the overdensity features of tidal tails around the\nfive metal-poor globular clusters. Our results add further observational\nevidence that the observed metal-poor halo globular clusters originate from an\naccreted satellite system, indicative of the merging scenario of the formation\nof the Galactic halo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2009 21:48:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The AD mechanism predicts the formation of non-topological solitons,\nQ-balls, from which GWs are generated. Q-balls with large conserved charge $Q$\ncan produce a large amount of GWs. On the other hand, the decay rate of such\nQ-balls is so small that they may dominate the energy density of the universe,\nwhich implies that GWs are significantly diluted and that their frequencies are\nredshifted during Q-ball dominated era. Thus, the detectability of the GWs\nassociated with the formation of Q-balls is determined by these two competing\neffects. We find that there is a finite but small parameter region where such\nGWs may be detected by future detectors such as DECIGO or BBO, only in the case\nwhen the thermal logarithmic potential dominates the potential of the AD field.\nOtherwise GWs from Q-balls would not be detectable even by these futuristic\ndetectors: $\\Omega_{\\rm GW}^0<10^{-21}$.

That is to say, there is no effective field that\nlocally drives the spin current. We also investigate the conversion mechanism\nof the pumped spin current into a charge current by spin-orbit interactions,\nspecifically the inverse spin Hall effect. We show that the spin-charge\nconversion does not always occur and that it depends strongly on the type of\nspin-orbit interaction. In a Rashba spin-orbit system, the local part of the\ncharge current is proportional to the spin relaxation torque, and the local\nspin current, which does not arise from the spin accumulation, does not play\nany role in the conversion. In contrast, the diffusive spin current contributes\nto the diffusive charge current. Alternatively, for spin-orbit interactions\narising from random impurities, the local charge current is proportional to the\nlocal spin current that constitutes only a small fraction of the total spin\ncurrent.

Operationally local transformations are parameterized\nonly by local variables, however in order to allow violation of the CHSH\ninequality a maximally entangled ancilla was necessary. The use of the\nentangled ancilla in this scheme caused the state under test to become\ndependent on the measurement choice one uses to calculate the CHSH inequality\nthus violating one of the assumptions used in deriving a Bell inequality,\nnamely the `free will' or `statistical independence' assumption.

In this paper we report on the implementation of a versatile\nthree-beam lattice allowing for the generation of triangular as well as\nhexagonal optical lattices. As an important step the superfluid-Mott insulator\n(SF-MI) quantum phase transition has been observed and investigated in detail\nin this lattice geometry for the first time. In addition to this we study the\nphysics of spinor Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) in the presence of the\ntriangular optical lattice potential, especially spin changing dynamics across\nthe SF-MI transition. Our results suggest that below the SF-MI phase\ntransition, a well-established mean-field model describes the observed data\nwhen renormalizing the spin-dependent interaction. Interestingly this opens new\nperspectives for a lattice driven tuning of a spin dynamics resonance occurring\nthrough the interplay of quadratic Zeeman effect and spin-dependent\ninteraction. We finally discuss further lattice configurations which can be\nrealized with our setup.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2009 13:20:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-01"}

Numerical\nsimulations by Terradas et al. (2008, ApJ 687, L115) suggest that shear flows\ngenerated at the loop boundary during kink oscillations could give rise to a\nKelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI). Here, we investigate the linear stage of\nthe KHI in a cylindrical magnetic flux tube in the presence of azimuthal shear\nmotions. We consider the basic, linearized MHD equations in the beta = 0\napproximation, and apply them to a straight and homogeneous cylindrical flux\ntube model embedded in a coronal environment. Azimuthal shear flows with a\nsharp jump of the velocity at the cylinder boundary are included in the model.\nWe obtain an analytical expression for the dispersion relation of the unstable\nMHD modes supported by the configuration, and compute analytical approximations\nof the critical velocity shear and the KHI growth rate in the thin tube limit.\nA parametric study of the KHI growth rates is performed by numerically solving\nthe full dispersion relation. We find that fluting-like modes can develop a KHI\nin time-scales comparable to the period of kink oscillations of the flux tube.\nThe KHI growth rates increase with the value of the azimuthal wavenumber and\ndecrease with the longitudinal wavenumber. However, the presence of a small\nazimuthal component of the magnetic field can suppress the KHI. Azimuthal\nmotions related to kink oscillations of untwisted coronal loops may trigger a\nKHI, but this phenomenon has not been observed to date. We propose that the\nazimuthal component of the magnetic field is responsible for suppressing the\nKHI in a stable coronal loop. The required twist is small enough to prevent the\ndevelopment of the pinch instability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2009 11:33:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

Recently, this approach has enabled us to obtain the correct trends of\nthe both critical parameters of the equisize charge-asymmetric PM without\nassuming ionic association. In this paper we focus on the general case of an\nasymmetric PM characterized by the two parameters: hard-sphere diameter-,\n$\\lambda=\\sigma_{+}/\\sigma_{-}$ and charge, $z=q_{+}/|q_{-}|$, ratios of the\ntwo ionic species. We derive an explicit expression for the chemical potential\nconjugate to the order parameter which includes the effects of correlations up\nto the third order.

Similar to simulations, our theory predicts that\nthe critical temperature and the critical density decrease with the increase of\nsize asymmetry. Regarding the effects of charge asymmetry, we obtain the\ncorrect trend of the critical temperature with $z$, while the trend of the\ncritical density obtained in this approximation is inconsistent with\nsimulations, as well as with our previous results found in the higher-order\napproximation.

CRESST\nuses scintillating CaWO4 crystals as such a target. The energy deposited by an\ninteracting particle is primarily converted to phonons which are detected by\ntransition edge sensors. In addition, a small fraction of the interaction\nenergy is emitted from the crystals in the form of scintillation light which is\nmeasured in coincidence with the phonon signal by a separate cryogenic light\ndetector for each target crystal. The ratio of light to phonon energy permits\nthe discrimination between the nuclear recoils expected from WIMPs and events\nfrom radioactive backgrounds which primarily lead to electron recoils. CRESST\nhas shown the success of this method in a commissioning run in 2007 and, since\nthen, further investigated possibilities for an even better suppression of\nbackgrounds. Here, we report on a new class of background events observed in\nthe course of this work. The consequences of this observation are discussed and\nwe present the current status of the experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2009 14:37:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-01"}

As\nan application, we calculate the electromagnetic form factors of the pion and\nthe transition form factors of the omega and eta Dalitz decays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2009 15:47:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2010 14:45:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2010 16:08:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-12"}

The axial-vector\nWard-Takahashi identity preserving Bethe-Salpeter kernel is constructed and the\nspectrum of light mesons calculated. Our model goes significantly beyond the\nrainbow-ladder. We find that sub-leading Abelian corrections are further\ndynamically suppressed, and that our results supersede early qualitative\npredictions from simple truncation schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2009 15:54:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-21"}
