Every\nresidue is individually Yangian invariant, but does not have a local space-time\ninterpretation--only a special sum over residues gives physical amplitudes. In\nthis paper we show that the sum over residues giving tree amplitudes can be\nunified into a single algebraic variety, which we explicitly construct for all\nNMHV and N^2MHV amplitudes. Remarkably, this allows the contour integral to\nhave a \"particle interpretation\" in the Grassmannian, where higher-point\namplitudes can be constructed from lower-point ones by adding one particle at a\ntime, with soft limits manifest. We move on to show that the connected\nprescription for tree amplitudes in Witten's twistor string theory also admits\na Grassmannian particle interpretation, where the integral over the\nGrassmannian localizes over the Veronese map from G(2,n) to G(k,n). These\napparently very different theories are related by a natural deformation with a\nparameter t that smoothly interpolates between them. For NMHV amplitudes, we\nuse a simple residue theorem to prove t-independence of the result, thus\nestablishing a novel kind of duality between these theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Dec 2009 20:53:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Dec 2010 20:31:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-17"}

The current paradigm suggests that BH/WH\nformation in particles collisions will happen when center of mass energies of\ncolliding particles is sufficiently above the Planck scale (the transplanckian\nregion). To estimate the BH/WH production we use the classical geometrical\ncross section. We confirm the classical geometrical cross section of the BH\nproduction reconsidering the process of two transplanckian particles collision\nin the rest frame of one of incident particles. This consideration permits to\nuse the standard Thorne's hoop conjecture for a matter compressed into a region\nto prove a variant of the conjecture dealing with a total amount of compressed\nenergy in the case of colliding particles. We calculate geometrical cross\nsections for different processes and for different background, in particular,\nfor (A)dS.

We show that the process of BH\nformation is catalyzed by the negative cosmological constant and by a\nparticular scalar matter, namely dilaton, while it is relaxed by the positive\ncosmological constant and at a critical value just turns off.

Unlike previous approaches to belief change in\nlogic programming, our formal techniques are analogous to those of\ndistance-based belief revision in propositional logic. In developing our\nresults, we build upon the model theory of logic programs furnished by SE\nmodels. Since SE models provide a formal, monotonic characterisation of logic\nprograms, we can adapt techniques from the area of belief revision to belief\nchange in logic programs. We introduce methods for revising and merging logic\nprograms, respectively. For the former, we study both subset-based revision as\nwell as cardinality-based revision, and we show that they satisfy the majority\nof the AGM postulates for revision. For merging, we consider operators\nfollowing arbitration merging and IC merging, respectively. We also present\nencodings for computing the revision as well as the merging of logic programs\nwithin the same logic programming framework, giving rise to a direct\nimplementation of our approach in terms of off-the-shelf answer set solvers.\nThese encodings reflect in turn the fact that our change operators do not\nincrease the complexity of the base formalism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Dec 2009 18:33:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-31"}

Concrete mode examples constructed from\nsymmetrised tetrahedral polynomials are given, demonstrating rapid convergence\nfor known bispectra. We use these modes to generate simulated CMB maps of high\nresolution (l > 2000) given an arbitrary primordial power spectrum and\nbispectrum or an arbitrary late-time CMB angular power spectrum and bispectrum.\nBy extracting coefficients for the same separable basis functions from an\nobservational map, we are able to present an efficient and general f_NL\nestimator for a given theoretical model. The estimator has two versions\ncomparing theoretical and observed coefficients at either primordial or late\ntimes, thus encompassing a wider range of models, including secondary\nanisotropies, lensing and cosmic strings.

An\ninfinite game is defined as a play consisting of a fixed number of players\nwhose sequence of moves is repeated, or iterated ad infinitum. Each sequence\ncorresponds to a single iteration of the play, where there are an infinite\namount of iterations. There are two distinct concepts within this broad\ndefinition which encompass all infinite games: the strong infinite game and the\nweak infinite game. Both differ in terms of imputations. The strong infinite\ngame has a uniqueness qualification in that all moves must differ to the extent\nthat no imputation (these occur at the end of any given iteration) may ever be\nthe same. Conversely, there is no such qualification in a weak infinite game,\nany payout may equal another.\n  Another property shared by strong and weak infinite games (apart from their\nfulfilling the criterion of an infinite game) is the fact that both consist of\na countably infinite amount of moves. Therefore all infinite games have a\ncountably infinite number of turns; the set of all infinite games is composed\nof each strong and weak infinite game. This result has a very important\nconsequence: the ordinality of turns. That is, the moves of an infinite game\nhave an order or structure which they adhere to.

In particular, in any\ntheory satisfying these axioms, measurements can be represented by orthonormal\nsubsets of, and states, by vectors in, an ordered real Hilbert space -- in the\nquantum case, the space of Hermitian operators, with its usual tracial inner\nproduct. One final postulate (a simple minimization principle, still in need of\na clear interpretation) forces the positive cone of this space to be\nhomogeneous and self-dual and hence, to be the the state space of a formally\nreal Jordan algebra. From here, the route to the standard framework of\nfinite-dimensional quantum mechanics is quite short.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Dec 2009 20:20:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-31"}

We attempt a\nstatistical analysis of the albedo and redistribution efficiency for 24\ntransiting exoplanets that have at least one published secondary eclipse. For\neach planet, we show how to calculate a sub-stellar equilibrium temperature,\nT_0, and associated uncertainty. We then use a simple model-independent\ntechnique to estimate a planet's effective temperature from planet/star flux\nratios. We use thermal secondary eclipse measurements -those obtained at\nlambda>0.8 micron- to estimate day-side effective temperatures, T_d, and\nthermal phase variations -when available- to estimate night-side effective\ntemperature. We strongly rule out the \"null hypothesis\" of a single A_B and\nepsilon for all 24 planets. If we allow each planet to have different\nparameters, we find that low Bond albedos are favored (A_B<0.35 at 1 sigma\nconfidence), which is an independent confirmation of the low albedos inferred\nfrom non-detection of reflected light. Our sample exhibits a wide variety of\nredistribution efficiencies. When normalized by T_0, the day-side effective\ntemperatures of the 24 planets describe a uni-modal distribution. The\ndimensionless quantity T_d/T_0 exhibits no trend with the presence or absence\nof stratospheric inversions. There is also no clear trend between T_d/T_0 and\nT_0. That said, the 6 planets with the greatest sub-stellar equilibrium\ntemperatures (T>2400 K) have low epsilon, as opposed to the 18 cooler planets,\nwhich show a variety of recirculation efficiencies.

The proof is facilitated by\nresults of our recently published paper, JGP 59 (2009) 600-619. Since both pure\ngravity, the Einstein-Maxwell and pure Y-M fields are described for axially\nsymmetric configurations by the Ernst equation classically, their quantum\ndescriptions are likely to be interrelated. Correctness of this conjecture is\nsuccessfully checked by reproducing (by different methods) results of Korotkin\nand Nicolai, Nucl.Phys.B475 (1996) 397-439, on dimensionally reduced quantum\ngravity. Consequently, numerous new results supporting the Faddeev-Skyrme (F-S)\n-type models are obtained. We found that the F-S-like model is best suited for\ndescription of electroweak interactions while strong interactions require\nextension of Witten's results to the SU(3) gauge group. Such an extension is\nnontrivial. It is linked with the symmetry group SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1) of the\nStandard Model. This result is quite rigid and should be taken into account in\ndevelopment of all grand unified theories. Also, the alternative (to the\nF-S-like) model emerges as by-product of such an extension.

Both models possess\ngap in their excitation spectrum and are capable of producing knotted/linked\nconfigurations of gauge/gravity fields.

We have\nobserved M35 since 1997, using the Hydra Multi-Object Spectrograph on the WIYN\n3.5m telescope. Our stellar sample covers main-sequence stars over a magnitude\nrange of 13.0<V<16.5 (1.6 - 0.8 Msun) and extends spatially to a radius of 30\narcminutes (7 pc in projection at a distance of 805 pc or 4 core radii). Due to\nits youth, M35 provides a sample of late-type stars with a range of rotation\nperiods. Therefore, we analyze the radial-velocity measurement precision as a\nfunction of the projected rotational velocity. For narrow-lined stars (v sin i\n< 10 km/s), the radial velocities have a precision of 0.5 km/s, which degrades\nto 1.0 km/s for stars with v sin i = 50 km/s. The radial-velocity distribution\nshows a well-defined cluster peak with a central velocity of -8.16 +/- 0.05\nkm/s, permitting a clean separation of the cluster and field stars. For stars\nwith >=3 measurements, we derive radial-velocity membership probabilities and\nidentify radial-velocity variables, finding 360 cluster members, 55 of which\nshow significant radial- velocity variability. Using these cluster members, we\nconstruct a color-magnitude diagram for our stellar sample cleaned of field\nstar contamination. We also compare the spatial distribution of the single and\nbinary cluster members, finding no evidence for mass segregation in our stellar\nsample. Accounting for measurement precision, we place an upper limit on the\nradial-velocity dispersion of the cluster of 0.81 +/- 0.08 km/s. After\ncorrecting for undetected binaries, we derive a true radial-velocity dispersion\nof 0.65 +/- 0.10 km/s.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Dec 2009 21:47:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Generally speaking, there are two aspects to this partnership.\nFirst there is the application of game theory to cryptography. Yet, the purpose\nof this paper is to focus on the second aspect, the converse of the first, the\napplication of cryptography to game theory. Chiefly, there exist a branch of\nnon-cooperative games which have a correlated equilibrium as their solution.\nThese equilibria tend to be superior to the conventional Nash equilibria. The\nprimary condition for a correlated equilibrium is the presence of a mediator\nwithin the game. This is simply a neutral and mutually trusted entity. It is\nthe role of the mediator to make recommendations in terms of strategy profiles\nto all players, who then act (supposedly) on this advice. Each party privately\nprovides the mediator with the necessary information, and the referee responds\nprivately with their optimized strategy set. However, there seem to be a\nmultitude of situations in which no mediator could exist. Thus, games modeling\nthese sorts of cases could not use these entities as tools for analysis. Yet,\nif these equilibria are in the best interest of players, it would be rational\nto construct a machine, or protocol, to calculate them. Of course, this machine\nwould need to satisfy some standard for secure transmission between a player\nand itself. The requirement that no third party could detect either the input\nor strategy profile would need to be satisfied by this scheme. Here is the\nsynthesis of cryptography into game theory; analyzing the ability of the\nplayers to construct a protocol which can be used successfully in the place of\na mediator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Dec 2009 23:59:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-05"}

This\npaper addresses a key outstanding issue in PNC: synchronization among\ntransmitting nodes. We first investigate the impact of imperfect\nsynchronization (i.e., finite synchronization errors) in a 3-node network. It\nis shown that with QPSK modulation, PNC still yields significantly higher\ncapacity than straightforward network coding when there are synchronization\nerrors.

This feature is found to be\nassociated with a massive, off-centre cool gas clump, and actually forms the\nwest boundary of the cool clump. We find that the cool gas clump is moving at a\nsubsonic velocity of ~700 km/s toward west on the sky plane. We exclude the\npossibility that this cool clump was formed by local inhomogeneous radiative\ncooling in the intra-cluster medium, due to the effectiveness of the thermal\nconduction on the time-scale of $\\sim 0.3$ Gyr. Since no evidence for central\nAGN activity has been found in Abell 3158, and this cool clump bears many\nsimilarities to the off-centre cool gas clumps detected in other merging\nclusters in terms of their mass, size, location, and thermal properties (e.g.\nlower temperature and higher abundance as compared with the environment), we\nspeculate that the cool clump in Abell 3158 was caused by a merger event, and\nis the remnant of the original central cool-core of the main cluster or the\ninfalling sub-cluster. This idea is supported not only by the study of\nline-of-sight velocity distribution of the cluster member galaxies, but also by\nthe study of gas entropy-temperature correlation. This example shows that the\nappearance of such massive, off-centre cool gas clumps can be used to diagnose\nthe dynamical state of a cluster, especially when prominent shocks and cold\nfronts are absent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Dec 2009 06:35:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Here we examine the implications of mirror dark matter for experiments\nlike CDMSII/Ge and XENON10 which feature higher recoil energy threshold than\nthe DAMA NaI experiments. We show that the two events seen in the CDMSII/Ge\nexperiment are consistent with the interactions of the anticipated heavy $\\sim\nFe'$ component. This interpretation of the CDMSII/Ge events is a natural one\ngiven that a) mirror dark matter predicts an event rate which is sharply\nfalling with respect to recoil energy and b) that the two observed events are\nin the low energy region near threshold. Importantly this interpretation of the\nCDMSII events can be checked by on-going and future experiments, and we hereby\npredict that the bulk of the events will be in the $E_R \\stackrel{<}{\\sim} 18$\nkeV region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Dec 2009 07:16:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-16"}

In order to follow the conservation of\nangular momentum the Moon had to either move closer to the Earth or recede from\nEarth. The data from the Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment confirms it to be\nmoving away and the velocity of recession of the Moon have been found to be 3.8\ncm/year. This rate is not constant though. At present the Moon's orbit has a\nradius of 384,000km. But what is not yet known to all is that the orbital\nmotion of the moon is actually a spiral motion. The moon is spiralling out and\na very simple mathematical equation can describe the actual spiral motion of\nthe Moon.

We also\ndemonstrate similar light cone dynamics for the transverse field Ising model.\nOn longer time scales the supercritical state relaxes to a disordered state due\nto dynamical vortex unbinding. This scenario of dynamically suppressed vortex\nproliferation constitutes a reverse-Kibble-Zurek effect. We study this effect\nboth numerically using truncated Wigner approximation and analytically within a\nnewly suggested time dependent renormalization group approach (RG). In\nparticular, within RG we show that there are two possible fixed points for the\nreal time evolution corresponding to the superfluid and normal steady states.\nSo depending on the initial conditions and the microscopic parameters of the\nHamiltonian the system undergoes a non-equilibrium phase transition of the\nKosterlitz-Thouless type. The time scales for the vortex unbinding near the\ncritical point are exponentially divergent, similar to the equilibrium case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Dec 2009 07:42:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

Currently, the favoured model involves the accumulation of meter-sized\nobjects within a turbulent disc, followed by a phase of gravitational\ninstability. At best one can simulate a few million particles numerically as\nopposed to the several trillion meter-sized particles expected in a real\nprotoplanetary disc. Therefore, single particles are often used as\nsuper-particles to represent a distribution of many smaller particles. It is\nassumed that small scale phenomena do not play a role and particle collisions\nare not modeled. The super-particle approximation can only be valid in a\ncollisionless or strongly collisional system, however, in many recent numerical\nsimulations this is not the case.\n  In this work we present new results from numerical simulations of\nplanetesimal formation via gravitational instability. A scaled system is\nstudied that does not require the use of super-particles. We find that the\nscaled particles can be used to model the initial phases of clumping if the\nproperties of the scaled particles are chosen such that all important\ntimescales in the system are equivalent to what is expected in a real\nprotoplanetary disc. Constraints are given for the number of particles needed\nin order to achieve numerical convergence.\n  We compare this new method to the standard super-particle approach. We find\nthat the super-particle approach produces unreliable results that depend on\nartifacts such as the gravitational softening in both the requirement for\ngravitational collapse and the resulting clump statistics.

This high spatial\nresolution allowed us to observe, for the first time in this galaxy, an\nunresolved dust concentration with mass 0.014 M_Sun, which may be part of the\ndusty torus. The emission-line fluxes are elongated in PA=135/315deg in\nagreement with the [OIII] and radio images and, except for the H lines, are\nbrighter to the north-west than to the south-east. The H emission is stronger\nto the south-east, where we find a large region of star-formation. The strong\ncorrelation between the radio emission and the highest emission-line fluxes\nindicates that the radio jet plays a fundamental role at these intensity\nlevels. The H2 flux is more uniformly distributed and has an excitation\ntemperature of 2100 K. Its origin appears to be circumnuclear gas heated by\nX-rays from the AGN. The [FeII] emission also is consistent with X-ray heating,\nbut with additional emission due to excitation by shocks in the radio jet. The\ncoronal-line emission of [CaVIII] and [SIX] are unresolved by our observations\nindicating a distribution within 18pc from the nucleus. The reddening ranges\nfrom E(B-V) ~ 0 to E(B-V) ~ 1.7 with the highest values defining a S-shaped\nstructure along PA ~ 135/315deg. The emission-line ratios are Seyfert-like\nwithin the ionization cone indicating that the line emission is powered by the\ncentral active nucleus in these locations. Low ionization regions are observed\naway from the ionization cone, and may be powered by the diffuse radiation\nfield which filters through the ionization cone walls. Two regions at 0.5\narcsec south-east and at 1 arcsec north-west of the nucleus show starburst-like\nline ratios, attributed to additional emission from star forming regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Dec 2009 12:48:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2010 16:17:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Our photometry is complete for magnitudes down to m_814 ~ 23 mag,\nallowing the calculation of the structural parameters of the clusters, the\nestimation of their ages and the determination of their stellar content. Our\nstudy shows that each cluster in our sample demonstrates stellar stratification\nin a quite different manner and at different degree from the others.\nSpecifically, NGC 1983 shows to be partially segregated only for the faintest\nstars of the cluster, NGC 2002 shows evidence of strong stellar stratification\nfor both bright and faint stars, and NGC 2010 is found not to be segregated.\nFor the parametrization of the phenomenon of stellar stratification and its\nquantitative comparison among these clusters, we propose the slope derived from\nthe change in the effective radius over the corresponding magnitude range as\nindicative parameter of the degree of stratification in the clusters. A\npositive value of this slope indicates mass segregation in the cluster, while a\nnegative or zero value signifies the lack of the phenomenon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Dec 2009 13:34:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}
