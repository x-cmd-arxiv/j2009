The rapidly increasing\nnumber of applications has heightened interest in more compact comb generators.\nOptical microresonator based comb generators bear promise in this regard.\nCritical to their future use as 'frequency markers', is however the absolute\nfrequency stabilization of the optical comb spectrum. A powerful technique for\nthis stabilization is self-referencing, which requires a spectrum that spans a\nfull octave, i.e. a factor of two in frequency. In the case of mode locked\nlasers, overcoming the limited bandwidth has become possible only with the\nadvent of photonic crystal fibres for supercontinuum generation. Here, we\nreport for the first time the generation of an octave-spanning frequency comb\ndirectly from a toroidal microresonator on a silicon chip. The comb spectrum\ncovers the wavelength range from 990 nm to 2170 nm and is retrieved from a\ncontinuous wave laser interacting with the modes of an ultra high Q\nmicroresonator, without relying on external broadening. Full tunability of the\ngenerated frequency comb over a bandwidth exceeding an entire free spectral\nrange is demonstrated. This allows positioning of a frequency comb mode to any\ndesired frequency within the comb bandwidth. The ability to derive octave\nspanning spectra from microresonator comb generators represents a key step\ntowards achieving a radio-frequency to optical link on a chip, which could\nunify the fields of metrology with micro- and nano-photonics and enable\nentirely new devices that bring frequency metrology into a chip scale setting\nfor compact applications such as space based optical clocks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Dec 2009 16:45:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-30"}

We present\nan iterative technique to determine a potential function consistent with ideal\nMHD evolution; but this E-field is also not a unique solution to Faraday's Law.\nFinally, we explore a variational approach that minimizes an energy functional\nto determine a unique E-field, similar to Longcope's \"Minimum Energy Fit\". The\nPTD technique, the iterative technique, and the variational technique are used\nto estimate E-fields from a pair of synthetic vector magnetograms taken from an\nMHD simulation; and these E-fields are compared with the simulation's known\nelectric fields.

For the reliable recovery of syntenic blocks, noise and\nambiguities in the genomic maps need to be removed first. Maximal Strip\nRecovery (MSR) is an optimization problem proposed by Zheng, Zhu, and Sankoff\nfor reliably recovering syntenic blocks from genomic maps in the midst of noise\nand ambiguities. Given $d$ genomic maps as sequences of gene markers, the\nobjective of \\msr{d} is to find $d$ subsequences, one subsequence of each\ngenomic map, such that the total length of syntenic blocks in these\nsubsequences is maximized. For any constant $d \\ge 2$, a polynomial-time\n2d-approximation for \\msr{d} was previously known. In this paper, we show that\nfor any $d \\ge 2$, \\msr{d} is APX-hard, even for the most basic version of the\nproblem in which all gene markers are distinct and appear in positive\norientation in each genomic map. Moreover, we provide the first explicit lower\nbounds on approximating \\msr{d} for all $d \\ge 2$. In particular, we show that\n\\msr{d} is NP-hard to approximate within $\\Omega(d/\\log d)$. From the other\ndirection, we show that the previous 2d-approximation for \\msr{d} can be\noptimized into a polynomial-time algorithm even if $d$ is not a constant but is\npart of the input.

The\ncalculations show that both vacancies and interstitials give rise to local\nmoments in $f$-shell of Pu in good agreement with experimental data for\nannealed Pu.

The\nlength of the series is sufficient to produce the corresponding Fuchsian linear\ndifferential equation (modulo a prime). We obtain the Fuchsian linear\ndifferential equation that annihilates the \"depleted\" series\n$\\Phi^{(6)}=\\tilde{\\chi}^{(6)} - {2 \\over 3} \\tilde{\\chi}^{(4)} + {2 \\over 45}\n\\tilde{\\chi}^{(2)}$. The factorization of the corresponding differential\noperator is performed using a method of factorization modulo a prime introduced\nin a previous paper. The \"depleted\" differential operator is shown to have a\nstructure similar to the corresponding operator for $\\tilde{\\chi}^{(5)}$. It\nsplits into factors of smaller orders, with the left-most factor of order six\nbeing equivalent to the symmetric fifth power of the linear differential\noperator corresponding to the elliptic integral $E$. The right-most factor has\na direct sum structure, and using series calculated modulo several primes, all\nthe factors in the direct sum have been reconstructed in exact arithmetics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Dec 2009 13:33:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

An\nalternative method to price European call option is proposed, which adopts an\nequilibrium argument to determine option price through the probability of\npositive return. It is found that the BS values are on average larger than the\nvalues of proposed method for out-of-the-money options, and smaller than the\nvalues of proposed method for in-the-money options. A typical smile shape of\nimplied volatility is also observed in our numerical investigation.
