In\ncontrast to those already considered by Wilson, Livio, and others, the present\napproach is based on relaxing hidden uniformitarian assumptions, considering\ninstead a dynamical succession of evolutionary regimes governed by both global\n(Galaxy-wide) and local (planet- or planetary system-limited) regulation\nmechanisms. This is in accordance with recent developments in both astrophysics\nand evolutionary biology. Notably, our increased understanding of the nature of\nsupernovae and gamma-ray bursts, as well as of strong coupling between the\nSolar System and the Galaxy on one hand, and the theories of \"punctuated\nequilibria\" of Eldredge and Gould and \"macroevolutionary regimes\" of Jablonski,\nValentine, et al. on the other, are in full accordance with the regulation-\nmechanism picture. The application of this particular strategy highlights the\nlimits of application of Carter's argument, and indicates that in the real\nuniverse its applicability conditions are not satisfied. We conclude that\ndrawing far-reaching conclusions about the scarcity of extraterrestrial\nintelligence and the prospects of our efforts to detect it on the basis of this\nargument is unwarranted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Dec 2009 13:19:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

A key obstacle in the way of producing\nrealistic simulations of the Sun-heliosphere system is the lack of a physically\nmotivated way of specifying the coronal heating rate. Recent one-dimensional\nmodels have been found to reproduce many observed features of the solar wind by\nassuming the energy comes from Alfven waves that are partially reflected, then\ndissipated by magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. However, the nonlocal physics of\nwave reflection has made it difficult to apply these processes to more\nsophisticated (three-dimensional) models. This paper presents a set of robust\napproximations to the solutions of the linear Alfven wave reflection equations.\nA key ingredient to the turbulent heating rate is the ratio of inward to\noutward wave power, and the approximations developed here allow this to be\nwritten explicitly in terms of local plasma properties at any given location.\nThe coronal heating also depends on the frequency spectrum of Alfven waves in\nthe open-field corona, which has not yet been measured directly. A model-based\nassumption is used here for the spectrum, but the results of future\nmeasurements can be incorporated easily. The resulting expression for the\ncoronal heating rate is self-contained, computationally efficient, and\napplicable directly to global models of the corona and heliosphere. This paper\ntests and validates the approximations by comparing the results to exact\nsolutions of the wave transport equations in several cases relevant to the fast\nand slow solar wind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Dec 2009 16:50:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

The condensate wave function psi(x,y) is a Gaussian\nexp(-r^2/2), multiplied by an analytic function f(z) of the complex variable z=\nx+ i y. The criterion for a quantum phase transition to a non-superfluid\ncorrelated many-body state is usually expressed in terms of the ratio of the\nnumber of particles to the number of vortices. Here, a similar description\napplies to a rapidly rotating non-symmetric two-dimensional trap with arbitrary\nquadratic anisotropy (omega_x^2 < omega_y^2). The corresponding condensate wave\nfunction psi(x,y) is a complex anisotropic Gaussian with a phase proportional\nto xy, multiplied by an analytic function f(z), where z = x + i \\beta_- y is a\nstretched complex variable and 0< \\beta_- <1 is a real parameter that depends\non the trap anisotropy and the rotation frequency. Both in the mean-field\nThomas-Fermi approximation and in the mean-field lowest Landau level\napproximation with many visible vortices, an anisotropic parabolic density\nprofile minimizes the energy. An elongated condensate grows along the soft trap\ndirection yet ultimately shrinks along the tight trap direction. The criterion\nfor the quantum phase transition to a correlated state is generalized (1) in\nterms of N/L_z, which suggests that a non-symmetric trap should make it easier\nto observe this transition or (2) in terms of a \"fragmented\" correlated state,\nwhich suggests that a non-symmetric trap should make it harder to observe this\ntransition.

A simple game is roughly weighted if there exists\na system of weights and a threshold such that all coalitions whose combined\nweight is above the threshold are winning and all coalitions whose combined\nweight is below the threshold are losing and a tie-breaking is needed to\nclassify the coalitions whose combined weight is exactly the threshold. Not all\nsimple games are roughly weighted, and the class of projective games is a prime\nexample.\n  In this paper we give necessary and sufficient conditions for a simple game\nto have rough weights. We define two functions f(n) and g(n) that measure the\ndeviation of a simple game from a weighted majority game and roughly weighted\nmajority game, respectively. We formulate known results in terms of lower and\nupper bounds for these functions and improve those bounds. We also investigate\nrough weightedness of simle games with a small number of players.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Dec 2009 20:33:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-31"}

Considering both cosmogenic\n$^{39}$Ar production and radiogenic $^{40}$Ar production in situ and from\nexternal sources, we can derive the ratio of $^{39}$Ar to $^{40}$Ar in\nunderground sources. We show for the first time that the $^{39}$Ar production\nunderground is dominated by stopping negative muon capture on $^{39}$K and\n($\\alpha,n)$ induced subsequent $^{39}$K(n,p)$^{39}$Ar reactions. The\nproduction of $^{39}$Ar is shown as a function of depth.

It\nallows systems at criticality to adapt swiftly to environmental changes (i.e.,\nhigh susceptibility) as well as to flexibly process and store information.\nThese unique properties prompted the conjecture that the brain might operate at\ncriticality (1), a view supported by the recent description of neuronal\navalanches in cortex in vitro (6-8), in anesthetized rats (9) and awake\nprimates (10), and in neuronal models (11-16). Despite the attractiveness of\nthis idea, its validity is hampered by the fact that its theoretical\nunderpinning relies solely on the replication of sizes and durations of\navalanches, which reflect only a portion of the rich dynamics found at\ncriticality. Here we show experimentally five fundamental properties of\navalanches consistent with criticality: (1) a separation of time scales, in\nwhich the power law probability density of avalanches sizes s, P(s) and the\nlifetime distribution of avalanches are invariant to slow, external driving;\n(2) stationary P(s) over time; (3) the avalanche probabilities preceding and\nfollowing main avalanches obey Omori law (17, 18) for earthquakes; (4) the\naverage size of avalanches following a main avalanche decays as a power law;\n(5) the spatial spread of avalanches has a fractal dimension and obeys\nfinite-size scaling. Thus, neuronal avalanches are a robust manifestation of\ncriticality in the brain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Dec 2009 21:05:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-31"}

In terms of update time and lookup\ntime there are known constructions that guarantee constant-time operations in\nthe worst case with high probability, and in terms of space consumption there\nare known constructions that use essentially optimal space. However, although\nthe first analysis of a dynamic dictionary dates back more than 45 years ago\n(when Knuth analyzed linear probing in 1963), the trade-off between these\naspects of performance is still not completely understood. In this paper we\nsettle two fundamental open problems: - We construct the first dynamic\ndictionary that enjoys the best of both worlds: it stores n elements using\n(1+epsilon)n memory words, and guarantees constant-time operations in the worst\ncase with high probability. Specifically, for any epsilon = \\Omega((\\log\\log n\n/ \\log n)^{1/2} ) and for any sequence of polynomially many operations, with\nhigh probability over the randomness of the initialization phase, all\noperations are performed in constant time which is independent of epsilon. The\nconstruction is a two-level variant of cuckoo hashing, augmented with a\n\"backyard\" that handles a large fraction of the elements, together with a\nde-amortized perfect hashing scheme for eliminating the dependency on epsilon.\n- We present a variant of the above construction that uses only (1+o(1))B bits,\nwhere B is the information-theoretic lower bound for representing a set of size\nn taken from a universe of size u, and guarantees constant-time operations in\nthe worst case with high probability, as before. This problem was open even in\nthe amortized setting.

In the past years,\nconsiderable attention has been devoted to the problem of finding efficient\ndata structures to support these searches, aiming at optimizing the encoders in\nterms of speed and memory. Hash tables, binary search trees and suffix trees\nhave been widely used for this purpose, as they allow fast search at the\nexpense of memory. Some recent research has focused on suffix arrays (SA), due\nto their low memory requirements and linear construction algorithms. Previous\nwork has shown how the LZ77 decomposition can be computed using a single SA or\nan SA with an auxiliary array with the longest common prefix information. The\nSA-based algorithms use less memory than the tree-based encoders, allocating\nthe strictly necessary amount of memory, regardless of the contents of the text\nto search/encode. In this paper, we improve on previous work by proposing\nfaster SA-based algorithms for LZ77 encoding and sub-string search, keeping\ntheir low memory requirements. For some compression settings, on a large set of\nbenchmark files, our low-memory SA-based encoders are also faster than\ntree-based encoders. This provides time and memory efficient LZ77 encoding,\nbeing a possible replacement for trees on well known encoders like LZMA. Our\nalgorithm is also suited for text classification, because it provides a compact\nway to describe text in a bag-of-words representation, as well as a fast\nindexing mechanism that allows to quickly find all the sets of words that start\nwith a given symbol, over a static dictionary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Dec 2009 11:45:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-31"}

It determines amplitude of such sufficiently strong\nclassical elastic force that forbids escape of a Planck mass particle moving by\nspeed of light from end of corresponding classical elastic spring, simply\ncalled dark spring. Also, by use of a formal identity between given elastic\nforce and Schwarzschild gravitational \"force\", we introduce phenomenologically\na simple quantization rule. It states that circumference (corresponding to\nelastic force amplitude equivalent formally to Schwarzschild radius) holds\nnatural number of corresponding reduced Compton's wave length. (It is deeply\nanalogous to Bohr's quantization postulate in Bohr's atomic theory interpreted\nby de Broglie relation.) Then, very simply (by simple algebraic equations only)\nand surprisingly, we obtain such dark spring characteristics corresponding to\nbasic thermodynamical characteristics (Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and Hawking\ntemperature) for corresponding Schwarzschild black hole. Finally, simple\ncomparison between obtained dark spring characteristics and\nSusskind-Horowitz-Polchinski correspondence, a simple correspondence between\nstrings and dark spring, i.e. classical linear harmonic oscillator follows.\nSquare root of the elasticity coefficient of the dark spring corresponds to\nquotient of one string coupling g and Newtonian gravitational constant, or,\nclassical elasticity coefficient of the dark spring corresponds to reciprocal\n(inverse) value of the square root of a string state excitation level N.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Dec 2009 13:11:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-31"}

We consider a\nspatial transformation, with which a physical phenomenon described in an\ninitial space is transformed to a deformed space, and interpret the mapping by\nlocal affine transformation point-by-point. Further, we postulate that the\ntransformed material property and field must rebuild the same physical process,\nand that the energy must be conserved at each point during the transformation.\nThese conditions impose the constraint on the transformed relation for material\nproperty and field.

In this\npaper, we extend this theorem to the case of multiresponse experiments, and we\nshow that when the number of experiments is finite, $c-,A-,T-$ and $D-$optimal\ndesign of multiresponse experiments can be computed by Second-Order Cone\nProgramming (SOCP). Moreover, our SOCP approach can deal with design problems\nin which the variable is subject to several linear constraints.\n  We give two proofs of this generalization of Elfving's theorem. One is based\non Lagrangian dualization techniques and relies on the fact that the\nsemidefinite programming (SDP) formulation of the multiresponse $c-$optimal\ndesign always has a solution which is a matrix of rank $1$. Therefore, the\ncomplexity of this problem fades.\n  We also investigate a \\emph{model robust} generalization of $c-$optimality,\nfor which an Elfving-type theorem was established by Dette (1993). We show with\nthe same Lagrangian approach that these model robust designs can be computed\nefficiently by minimizing a geometric mean under some norm constraints.\nMoreover, we show that the optimality conditions of this geometric programming\nproblem yield an extension of Dette's theorem to the case of multiresponse\nexperiments.\n  When the number of unknown parameters is small, or when the number of linear\nfunctions of the parameters to be estimated is small, we show by numerical\nexamples that our approach can be between 10 and 1000 times faster than the\nclassic, state-of-the-art algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Dec 2009 15:38:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 24 Jul 2010 01:25:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 25 Nov 2010 14:00:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-29"}
