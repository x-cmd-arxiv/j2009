This amplification may be due to\nplasma instabilities driven by shock-accelerated cosmic rays (CRs). One\ncandidate is the cosmic ray current-driven (CRCD) instability (Bell 2004),\ncaused by the electric current of large Larmor radii CRs propagating parallel\nto the upstream magnetic field. Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations have shown\nthat the back-reaction of the amplified field on CRs would limit the\namplification factor of this instability to less than ~10 in galactic SNRs. In\nthis paper, we study the possibility of further amplification driven near\nshocks by \"magnetized\" CRs, whose Larmor radii are smaller than the length\nscale of the field that was previously amplified by the CRCD instability. We\nfind that additional amplification can occur due to a new instability, driven\nby the CR current perpendicular to the field, which we term the \"perpendicular\ncurrent-driven instability\" (PCDI). We derive the growth rate of this\ninstability, and, using PIC simulations, study its non-linear evolution and\nsaturation. We find that PCDI increases the amplification of the field\n(amplification factor up to ~45, not including the shock compression) and\ndiscuss its observational signatures. Our results strengthen the idea of CRs\ndriving a significant part of the magnetic field amplification observed in SNR\nshocks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Dec 2009 23:40:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

A simple analytical model, based on the limit of weakly bound\nmolecules, agrees well with numerical experiments that explicitly include\ndissociation to noncondensate modes. For a resonant laser and an off-resonant\nmagnetic field, constructive interference enables saturation of the\nphotoassociation rate at user-friendly intensities, at a value set by the\ninterparticle distance. This rate limit is larger for smaller condensate\ndensities and, near the Feshbach resonance, approaches the rate limit for\nmagnetoassociation alone. Also, we find agreement with the unitary limit--set\nby the condensate size--only for a limited range of near-resonant magnetic\nfields. Finally, for a resonant magnetic field and an off-resonant laser,\nmagnetoassociation displays similar quantum interference and a dispersive-like\nshift. Unlike photoassociation, interference and the fieldshift in resonant\nmagnetoassociation is tunable with both laser intensity and detuning. Also, the\ndispersive-like shift of the Feshbach resonance depends on the size of the\nFeshbach molecule, and is a signature of non-universal physics in a strongly\ninteracting system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Dec 2009 19:12:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Starting from this catalog, we selected galaxies by matching\nAKARI sources with those in the IRAS PSCz. Next, we have measured total GALEX\nFUV and NUV flux densities. Then, we have matched this sample with SDSS and\n2MASS galaxies. By this procedure, we obtained the final sample which consists\nof 607 galaxies. If we sort the sample with respect to 90um, their average SED\nshows a coherent trend: the more luminous at 90um, the redder the global SED\nbecomes. The M_r--NUV-r color-magnitude relation of our sample does not show\nbimodality, and the distribution is centered on the green valley between the\nblue cloud and red sequence seen in optical surveys. We have established\nformulae to convert FIR luminosity from AKARI bands to the total infrared (IR)\nluminosity L_TIR. With these formulae, we calculated the star formation\ndirectly visible with FUV and hidden by dust. The luminosity related to star\nformation activity (L_SF) is dominated by L_TIR even if we take into account\nthe far-infrared (FIR) emission from dust heated by old stars. At high star\nformation rate (SFR) (> 20 Msun yr^-1), the fraction of directly visible SFR,\nSFR_FUV, decreases. We also estimated the FUV attenuation A_FUV from\nFUV-to-total IR (TIR) luminosity ratio. We also examined the L_TIR/L_FUV-UV\nslope (FUV- NUV) relation. The majority of the sample has L_TIR/L_FUV ratios 5\nto 10 times lower than expected from the local starburst relation, while some\nLIRGs and all the ULIRGs of this sample have higher L_TIR/L_FUV ratios. We\nfound that the attenuation indicator L_TIR/L_FUV is correlated to the stellar\nmass of galaxies, M*, but there is no correlation with specific SFR (SSFR),\nSFR/M*, and dust attenuation L_TIR/L_FUV.

Specifically, the core-halo\nmorphology of MN112 bears a striking resemblance to the circumstellar nebula\nassociated with the Galactic cLBV GAL 079.29+00.46, which suggests that both\nnebulae might have a similar origin and that the central star of MN112 is a\nLBV.
