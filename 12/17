This is likely a\nserious limitation since experience also tells us that one dimension is rarely\nrepresentative of what happens in higher dimensions. We here summarize recent\nprogress on developing the matching conditions that describe how codimension-2\nbranes couple to bulk metric, gauge and scalar fields. These matching\nconditions are then applied to three situations: D7-branes in F-theory\ncompactifications of 10D Type IIB string vacua; 3-branes coupled to bulk axions\nin unwarped and non-supersymmetric 6D systems; and 3-branes coupled to chiral,\ngauged 6D supergravity. For each it is shown how the resulting brane-bulk\ndynamics is reproduced by the scalar potential for the low-energy moduli in the\ndimensionally reduced, on-brane effective theory.

Such structure is often thought to pose a dynamical puzzle, because\ngrand-design spiral structure is traditionally interpreted as the result of\ndensity waves carried mostly in the stellar disk. Aims. Here we argue that the\nouter spiral arms in the cold gas outside the bright optical disk actually have\na natural interpretation as the manifestation of the mechanism that excites\ngrand-design spiral structure in the main, star-dominated body of the disk: the\nexcitation is driven by angular momentum transport to the outer regions,\nthrough trailing density waves outside the corotation circle that can penetrate\nbeyond the Outer Lindblad Resonance in the gaseous component of the disk.\n  Methods: Because of conservation of the density wave action, these outgoing\nwaves are likely to become more prominent in the outer disk and eventually\nreach non-linear amplitudes. To calculate the desired amplitude profiles, we\nmake use of the theory of dispersive waves.\n  Results: If the conditions beyond the optical radius allow for an approximate\ntreatment in terms of a linear theory, we show that fitting the observed\namplitude profiles leads to a quantitative test on the density of the disk\nmaterial and thus on the dark matter distribution in the outer parts of the\ngalaxy.\n  Conclusions: This study is thus of interest to the general problem of the\ndisk-halo decomposition of rotation curves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2009 16:18:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-10"}

The interaction of\nvery-high-energy (VHE: E>100 GeV) gamma-rays, emitted by sources located at\ncosmological distances, with the intervening EBL results in electron-positron\npair production that leads to energy-dependent attenuation of the observed VHE\nflux. This introduces a fundamental ambiguity in the interpretation of the\nmeasured VHE blazar spectra: neither the intrinsic spectra, nor the EBL, are\nseparately known - only their combination is. In this paper we propose a method\nto measure the EBL photon number density. It relies on using simultaneous\nobservations of blazars in the optical, X-ray, high-energy (HE: E>100 MeV)\ngamma-ray (from the Fermi telescope), and VHE gamma-ray (from Cherenkov\ntelescopes) bands. For each source, the method involves best-fitting the\nspectral energy distribution (SED) from optical through HE gamma-rays (the\nlatter being largely unaffected by EBL attenuation as long as z<1) with a\nSynchrotron Self-Compton (SSC) model. We extrapolate such best-fitting models\ninto the VHE regime, and assume they represent the blazars' intrinsic emission.\nContrasting measured versus intrinsic emission leads to a determination of the\ngamma-gamma opacity to VHE photons - hence, upon assuming a specific cosmology,\nwe derive the EBL photon number density. Using, for each given source,\ndifferent states of emission will only improve the accuracy of the proposed\nmethod.

We also aim\nto examine the conditions that lead to an inclined disc being disrupted by\nstrong differential precession. We use a grid-based hydrodynamic code to\nperform 3D simulations. This code has a relatively low numerical viscosity\ncompared with the SPH schemes that have been used previously to study inclined\ndiscs. This allows the influence of viscosity on the disc evolution to be\ntightly controlled. We find that for thick discs (h=0.05) with low alpha,\nefficient warp communication in the discs allows them to precess as rigid\nbodies with very little warping or twisting. Such discs are observed to align\nwith the binary orbit plane on the viscous evolution time. Thinner discs with\nhigher viscosity, in which warp communication is less efficient, develop\nsignificant twists before achieving a state of rigid-body precession. Under the\nmost extreme conditions we consider (h=0.01, alpha=0.005 and alpha=0.1), we\nfind that discs can become broken or disrupted by strong differential\nprecession.

In this paper we put forward\na fundamentally different approach that links such large-scale magnetic fields\nto the cosmological vacuum energy. In our scenario the dark energy is due to\nthe Veneziano ghost (which solves the $U(1)_A$ problem in QCD). The Veneziano\nghost couples through the triangle anomaly to the electromagnetic field with a\nconstant which is unambiguously fixed in the standard model. While this\ninteraction does not produce any physical effects in Minkowski space, it\ntriggers the generation of a magnetic field in an expanding universe at every\nepoch. The induced energy of the magnetic field is thus proportional to\ncosmological vacuum energy: $\\rho_{EM}\\simeq B^2 \\simeq (\\frac{\\alpha}{4\\pi})^2\n\\rho_{DE}$, $\\rho_{DE}$ hence acting as a source for the magnetic energy\n$\\rho_{EM}$.

To place this discovery in context, the uptake of elemental O into\ndust is considered over a wide range of environments, from the tenuous\nintercloud gas and diffuse clouds sampled by the depletion observations to\ndense clouds where ice mantles and gaseous CO become important reservoirs of O.\nThe distribution of O in these contrasting regions is quantified in terms of a\ncommon parameter, the mean number density of hydrogen. At the interface between\ndiffuse and dense phases (just before the onset of ice mantle growth) as much\nas 160 ppm of the O abundance is unaccounted for.

Of\nvarious potential carriers, the most plausible appears to be a form of\nO-bearing carbonaceous matter similar to the organics found in cometary\nparticles returned by the Stardust mission. The \"organic refractory\" model for\ninterstellar dust is re-examined in the light of these findings, and it is\nconcluded that further observations and laboratory work are needed to determine\nwhether this class of material is present in quantities sufficient to account\nfor a significant fraction of the unidentified depleted oxygen.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2009 01:12:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

In the cases of supernovae 2006my and 2006ov we argue\nthat the published candidate progenitors are not coincident with their\nrespective supernova sites in pre-explosion Hubble Space Telescope\nobservations. We therefore derive upper luminosity and mass limits for the\nunseen progenitors of both these supernovae, assuming they are red supergiants:\n2006my (log L/Lsun = 4.51; mass < 13Msun) and 2006ov (log L/Lsun = 4.29; mass <\n10Msun). In the case of supernova 2004et we show that the yellow-supergiant\nprogenitor candidate, originally identified in Canada France Hawaii Telescope\nimages, is still visible ~3 years post-explosion in observations from the\nWilliam Herschel Telescope. High-resolution Hubble Space Telescope and Gemini\n(North) adaptive optics late-time imagery reveal that this source is not a\nsingle yellow supergiant star, but rather is resolved into at least three\ndistinct sources. We report the discovery of the unresolved progenitor as an\nexcess of flux in pre-explosion Isaac Newton Telescope i'-band imaging.\nAccounting for the late-time contribution of the supernova using published\noptical spectra, we calculate the progenitor photometry as the difference\nbetween the pre- and post-explosion, ground-based observations.

One possible mechanism is the loss of\nequilibrium of coronal magnetic flux ropes formed gradually by large-scale\nsurface motions. In this paper, the locations of flux rope ejections in a\nrecently-developed quasi-static global evolution model are compared with\nobserved CME source locations over a 4.5-month period in 1999. Using EUV data,\nthe low-coronal source locations are determined unambiguously for 98 out of 330\nCMEs. Despite the incomplete observations, positive correlation (with\ncoefficient up to 0.49) is found between the distributions of observed and\nsimulated ejections, but only when binned into periods of one month or longer.\nThis binning timescale corresponds to the time interval at which magnetogram\ndata are assimilated into the coronal simulations, and the correlation arises\nprimarily from the large-scale surface magnetic field distribution; only a weak\ndependence is found on the magnetic helicity imparted to the emerging active\nregions. The simulations are limited in two main ways: they produce fewer\nejections, and they do not reproduce the strong clustering of observed CME\nsources into active regions. Due to this clustering, the horizontal gradient of\nradial photospheric magnetic field is better correlated with the observed CME\nsource distribution (coefficient 0.67). Our results suggest that, while the\ngradual formation of magnetic flux ropes over weeks can account for many\nobserved CMEs, especially at higher latitudes, there exists a second class of\nCMEs (at least half) for which dynamic active region flux emergence on shorter\ntimescales must be the dominant factor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2009 09:33:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

In\nthis setting, frugality [Archer&Tardos'02] provides a measure to evaluate the\n\"cost of truthfulness\", that is, the overpayment of a truthful mechanism\nrelative to the \"fair\" payment. We propose a uniform scheme for designing\nfrugal truthful mechanisms for general set systems. Our scheme is based on\nscaling the agents' bids using the eigenvector of a matrix that encodes the\ninterdependencies between the agents. We demonstrate that the r-out-of-k-system\nmechanism and the \\sqrt-mechanism for buying a path in a graph [Karlin et.\nal'05] can be viewed as instantiations of our scheme. We then apply our scheme\nto two other classes of set systems, namely, vertex cover systems and k-path\nsystems, in which a customer needs to purchase k edge-disjoint source-sink\npaths. For both settings, we bound the frugality of our mechanism in terms of\nthe largest eigenvalue of the respective interdependency matrix. We show that\nour mechanism is optimal for a large subclass of vertex cover systems\nsatisfying a simple local sparsity condition. For k-path systems, while our\nmechanism is within a factor of k + 1 from optimal, we show that it is, in\nfact, optimal, when one uses a modified definition of frugality proposed in\n[Elkind et al.'07]. Our lower bound argument combines spectral techniques and\nYoung's inequality, and is applicable to all set systems. As both r-out-of-k\nsystems and single path systems can be viewed as special cases of k-path\nsystems, our result improves the lower bounds of [Karlin et al.'05] and answers\nseveral open questions proposed in that paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2009 15:44:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 11 Apr 2010 07:14:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-09"}

The forcing function is a fully helical flow that can also be\nviewed as mimicking the effect of atmospheric convective motions. We test in\nthe helical case variants of a model developed previously (Baerenzung et al.\n2008a) against direct numerical simulations (DNS), using data from a run on a\ngrid of 15363 points; we also contrast its efficiency against a spectral Large\nEddy Simulation (LES) (Chollet and Lesieur 1981) as well as an under-resolved\nDNS.

A detailed model for\nconcrete channel estimation and feedback schemes provides parameter input to\nthe former model and covers the most important aspects such as pilot design\noptimization, linear channel estimation, feedback delay, and feedback\nquantization.

In this paper, we prove that Omega(n^2) is a lower bound\nfor the size of symmetric extended formulations of Pi_n.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2009 15:59:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2011 07:32:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2013 16:45:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-15"}

Real values of physical quantities concerning the\ngravitational action of the galactic neighbourhood of the Sun are important.\nThe results are compared with currently used more simple models of the galactic\ntide. It turns out that physically improved models yield results which\nsignificantly differ from the results obtained on the basis of the conventional\nmodels. E.g., the number of returns of the comets into the inner part of the\nSolar System are about two times greater than it is in the conventional models.\n  It seems that a comet from the Oort cloud can be a source of the dinosaurs\nextinction at about 65 Myr ago. A close encounter of a star or an interstellar\ncloud disturbed a comet of the Oort cloud in the way that its semi-major axis\nincreased/decreased above the value 5 $\\times$ 10$^{4}$ AU and the comet hit\nthe Earth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2009 15:59:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2010 13:44:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-15"}
