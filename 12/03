We consider measuring jet observables in\nexclusive multijet final states defined with cone and k_T-type jet algorithms.\nConsistency of the factorization theorem requires that the renormalization\ngroup evolution of hard, jet, and soft functions is such that the physical\ncross-section is independent of the factorization scale mu. The anomalous\ndimensions of the various factorized pieces, however, depend on the color\nrepresentation of jets, choice of jet observable, the number of jets whose\nshapes are measured, and the jet algorithm, making it highly nontrivial to\nsatisfy the consistency condition. We demonstrate the intricate cancellations\nbetween anomalous dimensions that occur at the NLL level, so that, up to power\ncorrections that we identify, our factorization of the jet shape distributions\nis consistent for any number of quark and gluon jets, for any number of jets\nwhose shapes are measured or unmeasured, for any angular size R of the jets,\nand for any of the algorithms we consider.

Inverse problems are those where a set of measured data is\nanalysed in order to get as much information as possible on a model which is\nassumed to represent a system in the real world. We study two inverse problems\nin the fields of classical and quantum physics: QCD condensates from tau-decay\ndata and the inverse conductivity problem. We use a functional method which\nallows us to extract within rather general assumptions phenomenological\nparameters of QCD (the condensates) from a comparison of the time-like\nexperimental data with asymptotic space-like results from theory. The price to\nbe paid for the generality of assumptions is relatively large errors in the\nvalues of the extracted parameters. Although we do not claim that our method is\nsuperior to other approaches, we hope that our results lend additional\nconfidence to the numerical results obtained with the help of methods based on\nQCD sum rules. In this thesis, also two approaches of EIT image reconstruction\nare proposed. The first is based on reformulating the inverse problem in terms\nof integral equations. This method uses only a single set of measurements for\nthe reconstruction. The second approach is an algorithm based on linearisation\nwhich uses more then one set of measurements. A promising result is that one\ncan qualitatively reconstruct the conductivity inside the cross-section of a\nhuman chest. Even though the human volunteer is neither two-dimensional nor\ncircular, such reconstructions can be useful in medical applications:\nmonitoring for lung problems such as accumulating fluid or a collapsed lung and\nnoninvasive monitoring of heart function and blood flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2009 17:06:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-03"}

Principal components analysis and a maximum likelihood method of\npower spectrum analysis are used. In common with other type I AGN, the spectral\nvariability is dominated by a varying-normalisation power-law component\ntogether with a quasi-steady, hard-spectrum offset component that contains Fe K\natomic features. NGC 4051 displays a strong excess over a power-law at energies\nabove 20 keV, some fraction of which also appears to vary with the power-law\ncontinuum. The fast-timescale power spectrum has a shape consistent with\nprevious determinations, but significant differences are found between the low\nand high flux states of the source, demonstrating that the power spectrum is\nnon-stationary. Frequency-dependent time lags between the hard and soft bands\nof up to 970+/-225s are measured. The existence of the observed lags excludes\nthe possibility that the hard spectral component originates as reflection from\nthe inner accretion disk. We instead show that the frequency- and\nenergy-dependent time lags may be explained as reverberation, caused by\nreflection from a thick shell of material with maximum lags of about 10,000s.\nIf the reflecting material surrounds the AGN, it extends to a distance about\n1.5x10^14 cm, 600 gravitational radii, from the illuminating source and the\nglobal covering factor is C(g) >~ 0.4, confirming suggestions that type I AGN\nhave high covering factors of absorbing and reflecting material. Given the\nspectral and timing similarities with other type I AGN, we infer that this\nstructure is common in the type I population.

The\napproach is general and can be applied to any density of a single random\nvariable. The method outlined here avoids the use of histograms, which require\nthe specification of a physical parameter (bin size) and tend to give noisy\nresults. The technique is an extension of the Berg-Harris method [B.A. Berg and\nR.C. Harris, Comp. Phys. Comm. 179, 443 (2008)], which is typically inaccurate\nfor radial distribution functions and potentials of mean force due to a\nnon-uniform Jacobian factor. In addition, the standard method often requires a\nlarge number of Fourier modes to represent radial distribution functions, which\ntends to lead to oscillatory fits. It is shown that the issues of poor sampling\ndue to a Jacobian factor can be resolved using a biased resampling scheme,\nwhile the requirement of a large number of Fourier modes is mitigated through\nan automated piecewise construction approach. The method is demonstrated by\nanalyzing the radial distribution functions in an energy-discretized water\nmodel. In addition, the fitting procedure is illustrated on three more\napplications for which the original Berg-Harris method is not suitable, namely,\na random variable with a discontinuous probability density, a density with long\ntails, and the distribution of the first arrival times of a diffusing particle\nto a sphere, which has both long tails and short-time structure.

Our simulation results reveal the onset\nof the modulational instability for long-crested wave-trains, which agrees well\nwith recent large-scale experiments in wave-basins, where it was found that\nnarrower directional spectra leads to self-focusing of ocean waves and an\nenhanced probability of extreme events. We find that the modulational\ninstability is nonlinearly saturated by a broadening of the wave-spectrum,\nwhich leads to the stabilization of the water-wave system.

Using Monte-Carlo simulations and assuming a rigid substratum, we find\nthat the cell speed depends only weakly on the adhesive properties of the\ncell-substratum, in agreement with experimental data. Varying the parameters\nthat control the adhesive and contractile properties of the cell we are able to\nmake testable predictions.

The sample is selected at a constant\nnumber density of n=2x10^-4 Mpc^-3, so that galaxies at different epochs can be\ncompared in a meaningful way. We show that the stellar mass of galaxies at this\nnumber density has increased by a factor of ~2 since z=2, following the\nrelation log(M)=11.45-0.15z. In order to determine at what physical radii this\nmass growth occurred we construct very deep stacked rest-frame R-band images at\nredshifts z=0.6, 1.1, 1.6, and 2.0. These image stacks of typically 70-80\ngalaxies enable us to characterize the stellar distribution to surface\nbrightness limits of ~28.5 mag/arcsec^2. We find that massive galaxies\ngradually built up their outer regions over the past 10 Gyr. The mass within a\nradius of r=5 kpc is nearly constant with redshift whereas the mass at 5-75 kpc\nhas increased by a factor of ~4 since z=2. Parameterizing the surface\nbrightness profiles we find that the effective radius and Sersic n parameter\nevolve as r_e~(1+z)^-1.3 and n~(1+z)^-1.0 respectively. The data demonstrate\nthat massive galaxies have grown mostly inside-out, assembling their extended\nstellar halos around compact, dense cores with possibly exponential radial\ndensity distributions. Comparing the observed mass evolution to the average\nstar formation rates of the galaxies we find that the growth is likely\ndominated by mergers, as in-situ star formation can only account for ~20% of\nthe mass build-up from z=2 to z=0.

If these\nsimulated winds accurately represent winds in the real Universe, then material\npreviously ejected in winds provides the dominant source of gas infall for new\nstar formation at redshifts z<1. This recycled wind accretion, or wind mode,\nprovides a third physically distinct accretion channel in addition to the \"hot\"\nand \"cold\" modes emphasised in recent theoretical studies. Because of the\ninteraction between outflows and gas in and around halos, the recycling\ntimescale of wind material (t_rec) is shorter in higher-mass systems, which\nreside in denser gaseous environments. In these simulations, this differential\nrecycling plays a central role in shaping the present-day galaxy stellar mass\nfunction (GSMF). If we remove all particles that were ever ejected in a wind,\nthen the predicted GSMFs are much steeper than observed; galaxy masses are\nsuppressed both by the direct removal of gas and by the hydrodynamic heating of\ntheir surroundings, which reduces subsequent infall. With wind recycling\nincluded, the simulation that incorporates our favoured momentum-driven wind\nscalings reproduces the observed GSMF for stellar masses 10^9 < M < 5x10^10\nMsolar. At higher masses, wind recycling leads to excessive galaxy masses and\nexcessive star formation rates relative to observations. In these massive\nsystems, some quenching mechanism must suppress the re-accretion of gas ejected\nfrom star-forming galaxies. In short, as has long been anticipated, the form of\nthe GSMF is governed by outflows; the unexpected twist here for our simulated\nwinds is that it is not primarily the ejection of material but how the ejected\nmaterial is re-accreted that governs the GSMF.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2009 21:17:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 May 2010 13:19:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

It is well known that the beam\nprofile derived from observations of Jupiter is non-Gaussian and indeed\nextends, in the W band for example, well beyond its 12.'6 FWHM core out to more\nthan 1 degree in radius. This means that even though the core width corresponds\nto wavenumber l\\approx1800, the form of the beam still significantly affects\nthe WMAP results even at l\\approx200 which is the scale of the first acoustic\npeak.

Beyond these scales the beam profiles from\nthe radio sources are too noisy to give useful information. Furthermore, we\nfind tentative evidence for a non-linear relation between WMAP and ATCA/IRAM 95\nGHz source fluxes.

We also argue against the possibility that Eddington\nbias is affecting our results. The reasons for the difference between the radio\nsource and the Jupiter beam profiles are therefore still unclear. If the radio\nsource profiles were then used to define the WMAP beam, there could be a\nsignificant change in the amplitude and position of even the first acoustic\npeak.

Using simple BLR models, we calculate the expected broad line\nprofile for a SMBH binary at different separations. Under reasonable\nassumptions that both BLRs are illuminated by the two active SMBHs and that the\nionizing flux at the BLR location is roughly constant, we confirm the emergence\nof double-peaked features and radial velocity drifts of the two peaks due to\nthe binary orbital motion. However, such a clear double-peaked feature only\narises in a particular stage of the binary evolution when the two BHs are close\nenough such that the line-of-sight orbital velocity difference is larger than\nthe FWHM of the individual broad components, while the two BLRs are still\nmostly distinct. Prior to this stage, the velocity splitting due to the orbit\nmotion of the binary is too small to separate the emission from the two BLRs,\nleading to asymmetric broad line profiles in general. When the two BHs are even\ncloser such that the two BLRs can no longer be distinct, the line profile\nbecomes more complex and the splitting of the peaks does not correspond to the\norbital motion of the binary. In this regime there are no coherent radial\nvelocity drifts in the peaks with time. Asymmetric line profiles are probably a\nfar more common signature of binary SMBHs than are double-peaked profiles.

The first\nclass of tools is more mathematical in character: the application of the theory\nof dynamical systems to select the better behaved models, with appropriate\nattractors in the past and future. The second class of tools is rather\nphysical: the use of astrophysical observations to crack the degeneracy of\nclasses of dark energy models. In this last case the observations related with\nstructure formation are emphasized both in the linear and non-linear regimes.\nWe exemplify several studies based on our research, such as quintom and\nquinstant dark energy ones. Quintom dark energy paradigm is a hybrid\nconstruction of quintessence and phantom fields, which does not suffer from\nfine-tuning problems associated to phantom field and additionally it preserves\nthe scaling behavior of quintessence. Quintom dark energy is motivated on\ntheoretical grounds as an explanation for the crossing of the phantom divide,\ni.e. the smooth crossing of the dark energy state equation parameter below the\nvalue -1. On the other hand, quinstant dark energy is considered to be formed\nby quintessence and a negative cosmological constant, the inclusion of this\nlater component allows for a viable mechanism to halt acceleration. We comment\nthat the quinstant dark energy scenario gives good predictions for structure\nformation in the linear regime, but fails to do that in the non-linear one, for\nredshifts larger than one.

The feature is consistent with the sterile neutrino mass of\n5.0 +/- 0.2 keV and a mixing angle in a narrow range for which neutrino\noscillations can produce all of the dark matter and for which sterile neutrino\nemission from the cooling neutron stars can explain pulsar kicks, thus\nbolstering both the statistical and physical significance of our measurement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2009 00:04:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2010 12:37:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 12 May 2010 17:50:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

The traffic\nis rerouted on a backup path in case of a failure. In this paper we propose to\ndesign a reliable and fault tolerant routing algorithm for establishing primary\nand backup paths. In order to establish the primary path, this algorithm uses\nload balancing in which link cost metrics are estimated based on the current\nload of the links. In backup path setup, the source calculates the blocking\nprobability through the received feedback from the destination by sending a\nsmall fraction of probe packets along the existing paths.

The origin of\nthese numerical problems can be traced back to spurious surface effects across\ncontact discontinuities, and to SPH's inherent prevention of mixing at the\nparticle level.

The time scale for complete disintegration\ndepends both on their initial membership and location within the Galaxy. Open\nclusters undergoing the terminal phase of cluster disruption or open cluster\nremnants (OCRs) are notoriously difficult to identify. From an observational\npoint, a combination of low number statistics and minimal contrast against the\ngeneral stellar field conspire to turn them into very challenging objects. To\nmake the situation even worst, random samples of field stars often display\nfeatures that may induce to classify them erroneously as extremely evolved open\nclusters. In this paper, we provide a detailed study of the stellar content and\nkinematics of NGC 6863, a compact group of a few stars located in Aquila and\ndescribed by the POSS as a non existent cluster. Nonetheless, this object has\nbeen recently classified as OCR. The aim of the present work is to either\nconfirm or disprove its OCR status by a detailed star-by-star analysis. The\nanalysis is performed using wide-field photometry in the UBVI pass-band, proper\nmotions from the UCAC3 catalogue, and high resolution spectroscopy as well as\nresults from extensive $N$-body calculations.

For a CC\nof arbitrary size and sign the corresponding cosmological evolution follows an\nexpansion history which strikingly resembles that of our real universe. The\neffects of the large CC are relaxed dynamically and there is no fine-tuning at\nany stage. In addition, the relaxation mechanism alleviates the coincidence\nproblem. The upshot is that a large cosmological constant and the observed\ncosmic expansion history coexist peacefully in the Relaxed Universe. This model\nuniverse can be thought of as an interesting preliminary solution of the\ncosmological constant problem, in the sense that it provides a successful\ndynamical mechanism able to completely avoid the fine-tuning problem (the\ntoughest aspect of the CC problem). However, since the Relaxed Universe is\nformulated within the context of modified gravity, it may still suffer of some\nof the known issues associated with these theories, and therefore it can be\nviewed only as a toy-model proposal towards a final solution of the CC problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2009 15:04:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2010 10:23:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-12"}

In\nmany applications, however, graphs that arise have several \\emph{local} regions\nof interest, and the second eigenvector will typically fail to provide\ninformation fine-tuned to each local region. In this paper, we introduce a\nlocally-biased analogue of the second eigenvector, and we demonstrate its\nusefulness at highlighting local properties of data graphs in a semi-supervised\nmanner. To do so, we first view the second eigenvector as the solution to a\nconstrained optimization problem, and we incorporate the local information as\nan additional constraint; we then characterize the optimal solution to this new\nproblem and show that it can be interpreted as a generalization of a\nPersonalized PageRank vector; and finally, as a consequence, we show that the\nsolution can be computed in nearly-linear time. In addition, we show that this\nlocally-biased vector can be used to compute an approximation to the best\npartition \\emph{near} an input seed set in a manner analogous to the way in\nwhich the second eigenvector of the Laplacian can be used to obtain an\napproximation to the best partition in the entire input graph. Such a primitive\nis useful for identifying and refining clusters locally, as it allows us to\nfocus on a local region of interest in a semi-supervised manner. Finally, we\nprovide a detailed empirical evaluation of our method by showing how it can\napplied to finding locally-biased sparse cuts around an input vertex seed set\nin social and information networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2009 15:20:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2011 14:30:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2011 03:18:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-24"}

In addition, there is a clear tendency for the field\nstars to be more metal-poor than the corresponding cluster they surround,\nindependent of their positions in the galaxy and of the clusters' age.

We\npresent a Markov chain based approach which converges to the uniform\ndistribution of all realizations for both the directed and undirected case. It\nremains an open challenge whether these Markov chains are rapidly mixing.\n  For the case of directed graphs, we also explain in this paper that a popular\nswitching algorithm fails in general to sample uniformly at random because the\nstate graph of the Markov chain decomposes into different isomorphic\ncomponents. We call degree sequences for which the state graph is strongly\nconnected arc swap sequences. To handle arbitrary degree sequences, we develop\ntwo different solutions. The first uses an additional operation (a\nreorientation of induced directed 3-cycles) which makes the state graph\nstrongly connected, the second selects randomly one of the isomorphic\ncomponents and samples inside it. Our main contribution is a precise\ncharacterization of arc swap sequences, leading to an efficient recognition\nalgorithm.
