We obtain this effective action through the 6D decoupling limit, in\nwhich an additional scalar degree mode, \\pi, called the brane-bending mode,\ndetermines the bulk-brane gravitational interaction. The 5D action obtained\nthis way inherits from the sixth dimension an extra \\pi self-interaction\nkinetic term. We compute appropriate boundary terms, to supplement the 5D\naction, and hence derive fully covariant junction conditions and the 5D\nEinstein field equations. Using these, we derive the cosmological evolution\ninduced on a 3-brane moving in a static bulk. We study the strong- and\nweak-coupling regimes analytically in this static ansatz, and perform a\ncomplete numerical analysis of our solution. Although the cascading model can\ngenerate an accelerating solution in which the \\pi field comes to dominate at\nlate times, the presence of a critical singularity prevents the \\pi field from\ndominating entirely.

An\nunderlying supersymmetric theory containing the states of the MSSM and\nsinglets, with supersymmetry and R symmetry broken at unified scales, has just\ntwo realistic low energy effective theories. One theory, (SM + \\tilde{w}), is\nthe Standard Model augmented only by the wino, having a mass near 3 TeV, and\nhas a Higgs boson mass in the range of (127 - 142) GeV. The other theory, (SM +\n\\tilde{h}/\\tilde{s}), has Higgsinos and a singlino added to the Standard Model.\nThe Higgs boson mass depends on the single new Yukawa coupling of the theory,\ny, and is near 141 GeV for small y but grows to be as large as 210 GeV as this\nnew coupling approaches strong coupling at high energies. Much of the parameter\nspace of this theory will be probed by direct detection searches for dark\nmatter that push two orders of magnitude below the present bounds; furthermore,\nthe dark matter mass and cross section on nucleons are correlated with the\nHiggs boson mass. The indirect detection signal of monochromatic photons from\nthe galactic center is computed, and the range of parameters that may be\naccessible to LHC searches for trilepton events is explored. Taking a broader\nview, allowing the possibility of R symmetry protection to the TeV scale or\naxion dark matter, we find four more theories: (SM + axion), two versions of\nSplit Supersymmetry, and the E-MSSM, where a little supersymmetric hierarchy is\npredicted. The special Higgs mass value of (141 \\pm 2) GeV appears in symmetry\nlimits of three of the six theories, (SM + axion), (SM + \\tilde{w}) and (SM +\n\\tilde{h}/\\tilde{s}), motivating a comparison of other signals of these three\ntheories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Dec 2009 22:07:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-25"}

The transmission time, low distortion reconstructed image and low\ncomplexity are most concerned in this paper. In the case of medical data\ntransmission, it is vital to keep the distortion level under control as in most\nof the cases certain clinically important regions have to be transmitted\nwithout any visible error. The proposed system significantly reduces the\ntransmission time and error. The progressive transmission is based on the\nprocess that the input image is decomposed into many subblocks each to be\ncoded, compressed, and transmitted individually. Therefore, firstly the image\nis segmented into a number of subblocks and then the discrete wavelet transform\ndecomposes each subblock into different time-frequency components. Finally the\ncomponents are coded for error control and transmitted. The complete system is\ncoded in VHDL. In the proposed system, we choose a 3-level Haar wavelet\ntransform to perform the wavelet transform for each subblock. It is simple,\nfaster and easier to implement when compared with other transform method.

The generation of\n'cat-like' states is central to numerous quantum information protocols. In\nparticular, much attention has been drawn by states containing N photons in a\nsuperposition of all being in one of two designated modes. These maximally path\nentangled states, known as 'NOON' states, exhibit enhanced phase sensitivity\nand allow reaching the fundamental quantum limit of precision measurement. Such\nstates could also be used for obtaining 'super-resolution' in quantum\nlithography. Creation of NOON states in the lab, has been limited to N=3.\nSurpassing this has proven a formidable experimental challenge. Here, we\nrealize a scheme for generation of high fidelity NOON states with arbitrarily\nlarge N. We demonstrate the versatility of the scheme by measuring up to N=5 in\na single setup, this is in contrast to previous experiments which were\ncustom-designed for a specific N. The scheme is based on high order\ninterference between 'quantum' down-converted light and 'classical' coherent\nlight in the photon number basis.
