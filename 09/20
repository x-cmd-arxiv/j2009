These oscillations have the common features of being of\nshort period (2-10 min) and being damped after a few periods. Kink\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave modes have been proposed as responsible for the\nobserved oscillations, whereas resonant absorption in the Alfven continuum and\nion-neutral collisions are the best candidates to be the damping mechanisms.\nHere, we study both analytically and numerically the time damping of kink MHD\nwaves in a cylindrical, partially ionized filament thread embedded in a coronal\nenvironment. The thread model is composed of a straight and thin, homogeneous\nfilament plasma, with a transverse inhomogeneous transitional layer where the\nplasma physical properties vary continuously from filament to coronal\nconditions. The magnetic field is homogeneous and parallel to the thread axis.\nWe find that the kink mode is efficiently damped by resonant absorption for\ntypical wavelengths of filament oscillations, the damping times being\ncompatible with the observations. Partial ionization does not affect the\nprocess of resonant absorption, and the filament plasma ionization degree is\nonly important for the damping for wavelengths much shorter than those\nobserved. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the phenomenon of\nresonant absorption is studied in a partially ionized plasma.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Sep 2009 17:21:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

Video data has a high degree of spatial and\ntemporal coherence. The property must be intelligently leveraged in order to\nobtain better results.\n  Graphical models, such as Markov Random Fields, have emerged as a powerful\ntool for such inference problems. They are naturally suited for expressing the\nspatial dependencies present in video data, It is however, not clear, how to\nextend the existing techniques for the problem of inference over time.

It is established the notion that a non-linear\nscheme is stable if and only if the corresponding scheme in variations is\nstable.
