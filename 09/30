With an average intrinsic size of 0.7+-0.3 kpc these galaxies are\nfound to be extremely compact having an average observed surface brightness of\nmu_J ~= 26 mag arcsec^(-2), and only two out of the full sample of 16 z~7\ngalaxies show extended features with resolved double cores. By comparison to\nlower redshift LBGs it is found that only little size evolution takes place\nfrom z~7 to z~6, while galaxies between z~4-5 show more extended wings in their\napparent profiles. The average size scales as (1+z)^(-m) with m=1.12+-0.17 for\ngalaxies with luminosities in the range (0.3-1)L*_{z=3} and with m=1.32+-0.52\nfor (0.12-0.3)L*_{z=3}, consistent with galaxies having constant comoving\nsizes. The peak of the size distribution changes only slowly from z~7 to z~4.\nHowever, a tail of larger galaxies (>~ 1.2 kpc) is gradually built up towards\nlater cosmic times, possibly via hierarchical build-up or via enhanced\naccretion of cold gas. Additionally, the average star-formation surface density\nof LBGs with luminosities (0.3-1)L*_{z=3} is nearly constant at Sigma_{SFR}=1.9\nMsun/yr/kpc^2 over the entire redshift range z~4-7 suggesting similar\nstar-formation efficiencies at these early epochs. The above evolutionary\ntrends seem to hold out to z~8 though the sample is still small and possibly\nincomplete.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2009 18:18:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2009 20:02:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2009 20:32:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Yet the\nfinite precision of measurement and computation unavoidably bandlimits our\nobservation and modeling scientific data, and we often only have access to, or\nare only interested in, a study area that is temporally or spatially bounded.\nIn the geosciences we may be interested in spectrally modeling a time series\ndefined only on a certain interval, or we may want to characterize a specific\ngeographical area observed using an effectively bandlimited measurement device.\nIt is clear that analyzing and representing scientific data of this kind will\nbe facilitated if a basis of functions can be found that are \"spatiospectrally\"\nconcentrated, i.e. \"localized\" in both domains at the same time. Here, we give\na theoretical overview of one particular approach to this \"concentration\"\nproblem, as originally proposed for time series by Slepian and coworkers, in\nthe 1960s. We show how this framework leads to practical algorithms and\nstatistically performant methods for the analysis of signals and their power\nspectra in one and two dimensions, and on the surface of a sphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2009 18:01:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-14"}

Specifically, we incorporate the presence\nof a Bloch/Neel domain walls and conical ferromagnetism, including spin-active\ninterfaces. The superconducting leads are assumed to be of s-wave type. We\ninvestigate how the 0-$\\pi$ transition is influenced by the inhomogeneous\nmagnetization texture and focus on the particular case where the charge-current\nvanishes while the spin-current is non-zero. In the case of a Bloch/Neel\ndomain-wall, the spin-current can be seen only for one component of the spin\npolarization, whereas in the case of conical ferromagnetism the spin-current\nhas the three components. We explain all of these results in terms of the\ninterplay between the triplet anomalous Green's function induced in the\nferromagnetic region and the local direction of the magnetization vector in the\nferromagnet.

This paper addresses the\ninferential problems associated with material indentation and atomic force\nmicroscopy, through a framework for the changepoint analysis of pre- and\npost-contact data that is applicable to experiments across a variety of\nphysical scales. A hierarchical Bayesian model is proposed to account for\nexperimentally observed changepoint smoothness constraints and measurement\nerror variability, with efficient Monte Carlo methods developed and employed to\nrealize inference via posterior sampling for parameters such as Young's\nmodulus, a key quantifier of material stiffness.

Most higher-dimensional edge detection algorithms consist of\napplying one-dimensional detectors in each component direction in order to\nrecover the locations in R^N where f(x) is singular (the singular support).\n  In this paper, we present a multidimensional algorithm which identifies the\nwavefront of a function from spectral data.

As an alternative to palpation, an increasing number of methods for\nestimation of the above-mentioned quantities are based on using imagery data of\nprostate. The necessity to process large volumes of such data creates a need\nfor automatic segmentation tools which would allow the estimation to be carried\nout with maximum accuracy and efficiency. In particular, the use of transrectal\nultrasound (TRUS) imaging in prostate cancer screening seems to be becoming a\nstandard clinical practice due to the high benefit-to-cost ratio of this\nimaging modality. Unfortunately, the segmentation of TRUS images is still\nhampered by relatively low contrast and reduced SNR of the images, thereby\nrequiring the segmentation algorithms to incorporate prior knowledge about the\ngeometry of the gland.

Specifically, when\nthe noise obeys a Poisson probability law, standard approaches to the problem\nof image reconstruction are based on using fixed-point algorithms which follow\nthe methodology first proposed by Richardson and Lucy.

We find that the\nsupercosets based on SU supergroups are self-dual under fermionic T-duality,\nwhile the supercosets based on OSp supergroups are not. However, the reasons of\nOSp supercosets being not self-dual under fermionic T-duality are different.\nFor $OSp(6|2)$ case, corresponding to $AdS_2\\times CP^3$ background, the\nfailure is due to the singular fermionic quadratic terms, just like\n$AdS_4\\times CP^3$ case. For $OSp(3|2)$ case, the failure is due to the\nshortage of right number of $\\kappa$-symmetry to gauge away the fermionic\ndegrees of freedom, even though the fermionic quadratic term is not singular\nany more. More general, for the supercosets of the OSp supergroups with\nsuperalgebra $B(n,m)$, including $AdS_2\\times S^{2n}$ and $AdS_4\\times S^{2n}$\nbackgrounds, the sigma models are not self-dual under fermionic T-duality as\nwell, obstructed by the $\\kappa$-symmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2009 02:21:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 4 Oct 2009 10:06:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2009 07:11:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-15"}

In this paper,\nwe developed a fast algorithm for finding the unicast capacity of a linear\ndeterministic wireless relay network by finding the maximum number of linearly\nindependent paths using the idea of path augmentation. We developed a modified\ndepth-first search algorithm tailored for the linear deterministic relay\nnetworks for finding linearly independent paths whose total number proved to\nequal the unicast capacity of the underlying network.

The post shock\nflow is located at few tens of Schwarzchild radius and it is generally very hot\nand dense. This successfully mimics the so called Compton cloud which is\nbelieved to be responsible for emitting hard radiations. Due to the radiative\nloss, a significant energy from the accreting matter is removed and the shock\nmoves forward towards the black hole in order to maintain the pressure balance\nacross it.

The main conclusion is: To achieve an\naccuracy of the order of 1% it is enough to take into account up to the third\ncorrection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2009 08:47:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2009 13:57:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

In the same spectrum, a triple peak\npolarization signal is also observed in the Sc II line at 4247 A. Scandium has\na single stable isotope (^{45}Sc), which shows HFS due to a nuclear spin I=7/2.\nWe investigate the possibility of interpreting the linear polarization profile\nshown in the second solar spectrum by this Sc II line in terms of HFS. A\ntwo-level model atom with HFS is assumed. Adopting an optically thin slab\nmodel, the role of atomic polarization and of HFS is investigated, avoiding the\ncomplications caused by radiative transfer effects. The slab is assumed to be\nilluminated from below by the photospheric continuum, and the polarization of\nthe radiation scattered at 90 degrees is investigated. The three-peak structure\nof the scattering polarization profile observed in this Sc II line cannot be\nfully explained in terms of HFS. Given the similarities between the Sc II line\nat 4247 A and the Ba II line at 4554 A, it is not clear why, within the same\nmodeling assumptions, only the three-peak Q/I profile of the barium line can be\nfully interpreted in terms of HFS. The failure to interpret this Sc II\npolarization signal raises important questions, whose resolution might lead to\nsignificant improvements in our understanding of the second solar spectrum. In\nparticular, if the three-peak structure of the Sc II signal is actually\nproduced by a physical mechanism neglected within the approach considered here,\nit will be extremely interesting not only to identify this mechanism, but also\nto understand why it seems to be less important in the case of the barium line.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2009 10:21:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The SN shows strong continuum interstellar\npolarization reaching about 8% at 4000A, characterized by a wavelength\ndependency that is substantially different from that of the Milky-Way dust\nmixture. Several SN features, like SiII 6355A and the CaII IR triplet, present\na marked evolution. The CaII near-IR triplet shows a pronounced polarization\n(~1.4%) already on day -10 in correspondence with a strong high-velocity\nfeature (HVF). The SiII polarization peaks on day -6 at about 1.1% and\ndecreases to 0.8% on day -1. By day +39 no polarization signal is detected for\nthe SiII line, while the CaII IR triplet shows a marked re-polarization at the\nlevel of 1.2%. As in the case of another strongly polarized SN (2004dt), no\npolarization was detected across the OI 7774A absorption. The fast-expanding\nSN2006X lies on the upper edge of the relation between peak polarization and\ndecline rate, and it confirms previous speculations about a correlation between\ndegree of polarization, expansion velocity, and HVF strength. The polarization\nof CaII detected in our last epoch, the most advanced ever obtained for a Type\nIa SN, coincides in velocity with the outer boundary of the Ca synthesized\nduring the explosion (15,000-17,000 km/s) in delayed-detonation models. This\nsuggests a large scale chemical inhomogeneity as produced by off-center\ndetonations, a rather small amount of mixing, or a combination of both effects.\nIn contrast, the absence of polarization at the inner edge of the Ca-rich layer\n(8000-10,000 km/s) implies a substantial amount of mixing in these deeper\nregions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2009 10:40:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-02"}

Our 3-D simulations confirm\naxisymmetric results: the material that has too much angular momentum to be\naccreted forms a thick torus near the equator and the mass accretion rate is\nlower than the Bondi rate.\n  In our previous study of the 3-D accretion flows, for gamma=5/3, we found\nthat the inner torus precessed, even for axisymmetric conditions at large\nradii. The present study shows that the inner torus precesses also for other\nvalues of the adiabatic index: gamma=4/3, 1.2 and 1.01. However, the time for\nthe precession to set increases with decreasing gamma. In particular, for\ngamma=1.01 we find that depending on the outer boundary conditions, the torus\nmay shrink substantially due to the strong inflow of the non-rotating matter\nand the precession will have insufficient time to develop. On the other hand,\nif the torus is supplied by the continuous inflow of the rotating material from\nthe outer radii, its inner parts will eventually tilt and precess, as it was\nfor the larger gamma's.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2009 11:40:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

The\nmodel is characterized by two energy thresholds, Eagg and Efrag, which\ndemarcate different types of impacts: If the kinetic energy of the relative\nmotion of a colliding pair is smaller than Eagg or larger than Efrag, particles\nrespectively merge or break; otherwise they rebound. We assume that particles\nare formed from monomers which cannot split any further and that in a\ncollision-induced fragmentation the larger particle splits into two fragments.\nWe start from the Boltzmann equation for the mass-velocity distribution\nfunction and derive Smoluchowski-like equations for concentrations of particles\nof different mass. We analyze these equations analytically, solve them\nnumerically and perform Monte Carlo simulations. When aggregation and\nfragmentation energy thresholds do not depend on the masses of the colliding\nparticles, the model becomes analytically tractable. In this case we show the\nemergence of the two types of behavior: the regime of unlimited cluster growth\narises when fragmentation is (relatively) weak and the relaxation towards a\nsteady state occurs when fragmentation prevails. In a model with mass-dependent\nEagg and Efrag the evolution with a cross-over from one of the regimes to\nanother has been detected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2009 12:00:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2009 09:24:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The radiation from these\nparticles contributes to the total high energy gamma-ray flux and can initiate\na cascade, decreasing the effective gamma-ray opacity in the system. The aim of\nthis paper is to model the cascade emission and investigate if it can account\nfor the VHE gamma-ray flux detected by HESS from LS 5039 at superior\nconjunction, where the primary gamma-rays are expected to be fully absorbed. A\none-dimensional cascade develops along the line-of-sight if the deflections of\npairs induced by the surrounding magnetic field can be neglected. A\nsemi-analytical approach can then be adopted, including the effects of the\nanisotropic seed radiation field from the companion star. Cascade equations are\nnumerically solved, yielding the density of pairs and photons. In LS 5039, the\ncascade contribution to the total flux is large and anti-correlated with the\norbital modulation of the primary VHE gamma-rays. The cascade emission\ndominates close to superior conjunction but is too strong to be compatible with\nHESS measurements. Positron annihilation does not produce detectable 511 keV\nemission. This study provides an upper limit to cascade emission in gamma-ray\nbinaries at orbital phases where absorption is strong. The pairs are likely to\nbe deflected or isotropized by the ambient magnetic field, which will reduce\nthe resulting emission seen by the observer. Cascade emission remains a viable\nexplanation for the detected gamma-rays at superior conjunction in LS 5039.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2009 12:00:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-12"}

Despite being one of the most efficient comparison-based sorting\nalgorithms for distributed memory architectures its performance on GPUs was\npreviously unknown. For uniformly distributed keys our sample sort is at least\n25% and on average 68% faster than the best comparison-based sorting algorithm,\nGPU Thrust merge sort, and on average more than 2 times faster than GPU\nquicksort. Moreover, for 64-bit integer keys it is at least 63% and on average\n2 times faster than the highly optimized GPU Thrust radix sort that directly\nmanipulates the binary representation of keys. Our implementation is robust to\ndifferent distributions and entropy levels of keys and scales almost linearly\nwith the input size. These results indicate that multi-way techniques in\ngeneral and sample sort in particular achieve substantially better performance\nthan two-way merge sort and quicksort.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2009 15:58:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-01"}
