We show that in the two generation case,\nmaximal mixing can naturally arise only when the total neutrino mass matrix has\na quasi-degenerate pattern. The best way to demonstrate this is by decomposing\nthe quasi-degenerate spectrum in to hierarchial and inverse-hierarchial mass\nmatrices, both with small mixing. Such a decomposition of the quasi-degenerate\nspectra is in fact very general and can be done irrespective of the mixing\npresent in the mass matrices. With three generations, and two sources, we show\nthat only one or all the three small mixing angles in the total neutrino mass\nmatrix can be converted to maximal/large mixing angles. The decomposition of\nthe degenerate pattern in this case is best realised in to sub-matrices whose\ndominant eigenvalues have an alternating pattern. On the other hand, it is\npossible to generate two large and one small mixing angle if either one or both\nof the sub-matrices contain maximal mixing. We present example textures of\nthis.

Previous observational indications of these variations in the FIR and\nsubmm spectral range are scarce and limited to specific regions of the sky. To\ndetermine whether these results can be generalised to larger scales, we study\nthe evolution in dust emissivities from the FIR to mm wavelengths, in the\natomic and molecular ISM, along the Galactic plane towards the outer Galaxy. We\ncorrelate the dust FIR to mm emission with the HI and CO emission. The study is\ncarried out using the DIRBE data from 100 to 240 mic, the Archeops data from\n550 mic to 2.1 mm, and the WMAP data at 3.2 mm (W band), in regions with\nGalactic latitude |b| < 30 deg, over the Galactic longitude range (75 deg < l <\n198 deg) observed with Archeops. In all regions studied, the emissivity spectra\nin both the atomic and molecular phases are steeper in the FIR (beta = 2.4)\nthan in the submm and mm (beta = 1.5). We find significant variations in the\nspectral shape of the dust emissivity as a function of the dust temperature in\nthe molecular phase. Regions of similar dust temperature in the molecular and\natomic gas exhibit similar emissivity spectra. Regions where the dust is\nsignificantly colder in the molecular phase show a significant increase in\nemissivity for the range 100 - 550 mic. This result supports the hypothesis of\ngrain coagulation in these regions, confirming results obtained over small\nfractions of the sky in previous studies and allowing us to expand these\nresults to the cold molecular environments in general of the outer MW.

The main\nfinding is that the first oscillations in the amplitude are of nonzero\nasymptotic size even as epsilon tends to zero, and they display two separate\nnatural scales; of order epsilon in the parallel direction to the breaking\ncurve in the (x,t)-plane, and of order epsilon ln(epsilon) in a transversal\ndirection. The study is based upon the inverse-scattering method and the\nnonlinear steepest descent method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2009 19:15:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-18"}

The\nresulting upper limits on the gamma-ray emission above 100 GeV are in the range\nof 4.6 to 7.5 x 10^{-12} cm^{-2} s^{-1} for spectral indices from -1.5 to -2.5,\nthereby constraining the emission produced by cosmic rays, dark matter\nannihilations, and the central radio galaxy NGC1275. Results are compatible\nwith cosmological cluster simulations for the cosmic-ray-induced gamma-ray\nemission, constraining the average cosmic ray-to-thermal pressure to <4% for\nthe cluster core region (<8% for the entire cluster). Using simplified\nassumptions adopted in earlier work (a power-law spectrum with an index of\n-2.1, constant cosmic ray-to-thermal pressure for the peripheral cluster\nregions while accounting for the adiabatic contraction during the cooling flow\nformation), we would limit the ratio of cosmic ray-to-thermal energy to\nE_CR/E_th<3%. The upper limit also translates into a level of gamma-ray\nemission from possible annihilations of the cluster dark matter (the dominant\nmass component) that is consistent with boost factors of ~10^4 for the\ntypically expected dark matter annihilation-induced emission. Finally, the\nupper limits obtained for the gamma-ray emission of the central radio galaxy\nNGC1275 are consistent with the recent detection by the Fermi-LAT satellite.\nDue to the extremely large Doppler factors required for the jet, a one-zone\nsynchrotron self-Compton model is implausible in this case. We reproduce the\nobserved spectral energy density by using the structured jet (spine-layer)\nmodel which has previously been adopted to explain the high-energy emission of\nradio galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2009 19:07:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2009 11:53:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2010 18:53:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

Although the dust in disks is\nrelatively easily detected as a far-IR photometric ``excess'' over the expected\nphotospheric emission, much less is known about the gas phase. It seems clear\nthat an abrupt transition from massive optically thick disks (gas-rich\nstructures where only ~1% of the total mass is in the form of dust) to tenuous\ndebris disks almost devoid of gas occurs at ~10^7 years, by which time the\nmajority of at least the giant planets must have formed. Indeed, these planets\nare largely gaseous and thus they must assemble before the gas disk dissipates.\nSpectroscopic studies of the disk gas content at different evolutive stages are\nthus critical. Far-IR water vapor lines and atomic fine structure lines from\nabundant gas reservoirs (e.g., [OI]63um, [SI]56um, [SiII]34um) are robust\ntracers of the gas in disks. Spectrometers on board Herschel will detect some\nof these lines toward the closest, youngest and more massive protoplanetary\ndisks. However, according to models, Herschel will not reach the required\nsensitivity to (1) detect the gas residual in more evolved and tenuous\ntransational disks that are potentially forming planets and (2) detect the gas\nemission from less massive protoplanetary disks around the most numerous stars\nin the Galaxy (M-type and cooler dwarfs). Both are unique goals for\nSPICA/SAFARI. Besides, SAFARI will be able to detect the far-IR modes of water\nice at ~44 and ~62um, and thus allow water ice to be observed in many\nprotoplanetary systems and fully explore its impact on planetary formation and\nevolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2009 17:30:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

We found tight OIR/X-ray\ncorrelations over four decades with the presence of a break in the IR/X-ray\ncorrelation in the hard state. This correlation is the same for all four\noutbursts. This can be interpreted in a consistent way by considering a\nsynchrotron self-Compton origin of the X-rays in which the break frequency\nvaries between the optically thick and thin regime of the jet spectrum. We also\nhighlight the similarities and differences between optical/X-ray and IR/X-ray\ncorrelations which suggest a jet origin of the near-IR emission in the hard\nstate while the optical is more likely dominated by the blackbody emission of\nthe accretion disc in both hard and soft state. However we find a non\nnegligible contribution of 40 per cent of the jet emission in the V-band during\nthe hard state.\n  We finally concentrate on a soft-to-hard state transition during the decay of\nthe 2004 outburst by comparing the radio, IR, optical and hard X-rays light\ncurves.

In this paper, we present the first spectroscopic\nstudy of individual red giant branch stars in And X, as a part of the SPLASH\nSurvey (Spectroscopic and Photometric Landscape of Andromeda's Stellar Halo).\nUsing the Keck II telescope and multiobject DEIMOS spectrograph, we target two\nspectroscopic masks over the face of the galaxy and measure radial velocities\nfor ~100 stars with a median accuracy of sigma_v ~ 3 km/s. The velocity\nhistogram for this field confirms three populations of stars along the sight\nline: foreground Milky Way dwarfs at small negative velocities, M31 halo red\ngiants over a broad range of velocities, and a very cold velocity ``spike''\nconsisting of 22 stars belonging to And X with v_rad = -163.8 +/- 1.2 km/s. By\ncarefully considering both the random and systematic velocity errors of these\nstars (e.g., through duplicate star measurements), we derive an intrinsic\nvelocity dispersion of just sigma_v = 3.9 +/- 1.2 km/s for And X, which for its\nsize, implies a minimum mass-to-light ratio of M/L =37^{+26}_{-19} assuming the\nmass traces the light. Based on the clean sample of member stars, we measure\nthe median metallicity of And X to be [Fe/H] = -1.93 +/- 0.11, with a slight\nradial metallicity gradient. The dispersion in metallicity is large,\nsigma([Fe/H]) = 0.48, possibly hinting that the galaxy retained much of its\nchemical enrichment products. We discuss the potential for better understanding\nthe formation and evolution mechanisms for M31's system of dSphs through\n(current) kinematic and chemical abundance studies, especially in relation to\nthe Milky Way sample.

Most study has focused on 'isolated'\ngalaxies, where seed asymmetries may represent realistic cosmological\nsubstructure, but subsequent evolution ignores galaxy growth. Large-scale modes\nin the disk then grow on a timescale of order a disk rotation period (0.1-1\nGyr). If, however, galaxies evolve cosmologically on a shorter timescale, then\nit may not be appropriate to consider them 'isolated.' We outline simple\nscalings to ask whether the timescale for secular evolution is shorter than the\ntimescale for cosmological accretion and mergers. This is the case in a narrow,\nbut important range of perturbation amplitudes corresponding to substructure or\nmode/bar fractional amplitudes 0.01-0.1, a range of interest for observed\nstrong bars and pseudobulges. At smaller amplitudes <<0.1, systems are not\nisolated: typical disks will grow by accretion at a comparable level over even\na single dynamical time. At larger amplitudes >>0.1, the evolution is no longer\nsecular; direct gravitational evolution of the seed swamps the internal disk\nresponse. We derive criteria for when disks can be well-approximated as\n'isolated' as a function of mass, redshift, and disk stability. The relevant\nparameter space shrinks at higher mass, higher disk stability, and higher-z as\naccretion rates increase. Cosmological rates of galaxy evolution also define a\nmaximum bar/mode lifetime of practical interest, of ~0.1/H(z). Longer-lived\nmodes will de-couple from their drivers (if driven) and encounter cosmological\neffects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2009 20:02:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Such an\nassumption is valid in the weak field, as verified by precision experiments and\nobservations, but it need not hold in the dynamical strong-field regime where\ntests are lacking. Fundamental bias can cause systematic errors in the\ndetection and parameter estimation of signals, which can lead to a\nmischaracterization of the universe through incorrect inferences about source\nevent rates and populations. We propose a remedy through the introduction of\nthe parameterized post-Einsteinian framework, which consists of the enhancement\nof waveform templates via the inclusion of post-Einsteinian parameters. These\nparameters would ostensibly be designed to interpolate between templates\nconstructed in general relativity and well-motivated alternative theories of\ngravity, and also include extrapolations that follow sound theoretical\nprinciples, such as consistency with conservation laws and symmetries. As an\nexample, we construct parameterized post-Einsteinian templates for the binary\ncoalescence of equal-mass, non-spinning compact objects in a quasi-circular\ninspiral.

The second purpose is to illuminate the related issue of discrete\nstatic beam angles vs. rotational techniques, which has recently re-surfaced\ndue to the advancement of volumetric arc therapy (VMAT). A specific objective\nis to find analytical expressions that allow one to address the points raised\nabove. To make the problem mathematically tractable, it is assumed that the\ndepth dose is flat and that the lateral dose profile can be approximated by\npolynomials, specifically Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind, of finite\ndegree. The application of methods known from image reconstruction then allows\none to answer the first question above as follows: The required number of beams\nis determined by the maximum degree of the polynomials used in the\napproximation of the beam profiles, which is a measure of the dose variability.\nThere is nothing to be gained by using more beams. In realistic cases, in which\nthe variability of the lateral dose profile is restricted in several ways, the\nrequired number of beams is of the order of 10 to 20. The consequence of\ndelivering the beams with a `leaf sweep' technique during continuous rotation\nof the gantry, as in VMAT, is also derived in analytical form. The main effect\nis that the beams fan out, but the effect near the axis of rotation is small.\nThis result can serve as a theoretical justification of VMAT.

In regular bipartite graphs, however, a matching is\nknown to be computable in O(m) time (due to Cole, Ost and Schirra). In a recent\nline of work by Goel, Kapralov and Khanna the O(m) time algorithm was improved\nfirst to \\tilde O(min{m, n^{2.5}/d}) and then to \\tilde O(min{m, n^2/d}).

There have been fewer studies of the\nasymptotic capacity of large-scale wireless networks based on CSMA\n(carrier-sensing multi-access), which schedules transmissions in a distributed\nand random manner. With the rapid and widespread adoption of CSMA technology, a\ncritical question is that whether CSMA networks can be as scalable as TDMA\nnetworks. To answer this question and explore the capacity of CSMA networks, we\nfirst formulate the models of CSMA protocols to take into account the unique\nCSMA characteristics not captured by existing interference models in the\nliterature. These CSMA models determine the feasible states, and consequently\nthe capacity of CSMA networks. We then study the throughput efficiency of CSMA\nscheduling as compared to TDMA. Finally, we tune the CSMA parameters so as to\nmaximize the throughput to the optimal order. As a result, we show that CSMA\ncan achieve throughput as $\\Omega(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}})$, the same order as\noptimal centralized TDMA, on uniform random networks. Our CSMA scheme makes use\nof an efficient backbone-peripheral routing scheme and a careful design of dual\ncarrier-sensing and dual channel scheme.

Hydrogen is not convincingly detected in the\nspectra of these systems. Three different proposed formation scenarios involve\ndifferent donor stars, white dwarfs, helium stars or evolved main-sequence\nstars. Using detailed evolutionary calculations we show that the abundances of\nhelium WD donors and evolved main-sequence stars are close to equilibrium\nCNO-processed material, and the detailed abundances correlate with the core\ntemperature and thus mass of the MS progenitors. Evolved MS donors typically\nhave traces of H left. For hybrid or CO white dwarf donors, the carbon and\noxygen abundances depend on the temperature of the helium burning and thus on\nthe helium core mass of the progenitors. For helium star donors in addition to\ntheir mass, the abundances depend strongly on the amount of helium burnt before\nmass transfer starts and can range from unprocessed and thus almost equal to\nCNO-processed matter, to strongly processed and thus C/O rich and N-deficient.\nWe briefly discuss the relative frequency of these cases for helium star\ndonors, based on population synthesis results. Finally we give diagnostics for\napplying our results to observed systems and find that the most important test\nis the N/C ratio, which can indicate the formation scenario as well as, in some\ncases, the mass of the progenitor of the donor. In addition, if observed, the\nN/O, O/He and O/C ratios can distinguish between helium star and WD donors.\nApplied to the known systems we find evidence for WD donors in the AM CVn\nsystems GP Com, CE 315 and SDSS J0804+16 and evidence for hybrid WD or very\nevolved helium star donors in the UCXBs 4U 1626-67 and 4U 0614+09.

The rare Y and Z\ngrains are likely to come from 1.5-3 Msun AGB stars as well, but with subsolar\nmetallicities (0.3-0.5x solar). Here we report on C and Si isotope and trace\nelement (Zr, Ba) studies of individual, submicrometer-sized SiC grains. The\nmost striking results are: (1) Zr and Ba concentrations are higher in Y and Z\ngrains than in mainstream grains, with enrichments relative to Si and solar of\nup to 70x (Zr) and 170x (Ba), respectively. (2) For the Y and Z grains there is\na positive correlation between Ba concentrations and amount of s-process Si.\nThis correlation is well explained by predictions for 2-3 Msun AGB stars with\nmetallicities of 0.3-0.5x solar.

In particular, we consider two cases of adiabatically slow driving,\nnamely (i) periodic temperature modulation of only one lead and (ii)\ntemperature modulation of both leads with an ac driving that contains a second\nharmonic, thus generating harmonic mixing. Both scenarios yield sizeable\ndirected heat currents which should be detectable with present techniques.\nAdding a static thermal bias, allows one to compute the heat current-thermal\nload characteristics which includes the ratchet effect of negative thermal bias\nwith positive-valued heat flow against the thermal bias, up to the thermal\nstop-load. The ratchet heat flow in turn generates also an electric current. An\napplied electric stop-voltage, yielding effective zero electric current flow,\nthen mimics a solely heat-ratchet-induced thermopower (``ratchet Seebeck\neffect''), although no net thermal bias is acting.

Therefore, the known\nanalytical scheme offers a good approximation in performance evaluation when\nthe correlation strength is sufficiently small.

A sample of 20 Class 0 and I protostars has been observed in\ncontinuum at (sub)millimeter wavelengths at high angular resolution with the\nSubmillimeter Array. Using detailed dust radiative transfer models, we have\ndeveloped a framework for disentangling the continuum emission from the\nenvelopes and disks, and from that estimated their masses. For the Class I\nsources in the sample, HCO+ 3-2 line emission has furthermore been observed\nwith the Submillimeter Array. Four of these sources show signs of Keplerian\nrotation, constraining the masses of the central stars. Both Class 0 and I\nprotostars are surrounded by disks with typical masses of about 0.05 M_sun. No\nevidence is found for a correlation between the disk mass and evolutionary\nstage of the young stellar objects. This contrasts the envelope mass, which\ndecreases sharply from 1 M_sun in the Class 0 stage to <0.1 M_sun in the Class\nI stage. Typically, the disks have masses that are 1-10% of the corresponding\nenvelope masses in the Class 0 stage and 20-60% in the Class I stage. For the\nClass I sources for which Keplerian rotation is seen, the central stars contain\n70-98% of the total mass in the star-disk-envelope system, confirming that\nthese objects are late in their evolution through the embedded protostellar\nstages. Theoretical models tend to overestimate the disk masses relative to the\nstellar masses in the late Class I stage. The results argue in favor of a\npicture in which circumstellar disks are formed early during the protostellar\nevolution and rapidly process material accreted from the larger scale envelope\nonto the central star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2009 08:40:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The range of stability of these supported membranes is\nstudied, showing a complex dependence on bare adsorption strengths.

The CoRoT space mission continues to photometrically monitor about 12\n000 stars in its field-of-view for a series of target fields to search for\ntransiting extrasolar planets ever since 2007. Deep transit signals can be\ndetected quickly in the \"alarm-mode\" in parallel to the ongoing target field\nmonitoring. CoRoT's first planets have been detected in this mode. Methods. The\nCoRoT raw lightcurves are filtered for orbital residuals, outliers, and\nlow-frequency stellar signals. The phase folded lightcurve is used to fit the\ntransit signal and derive the main planetary parameters. Radial velocity\nfollow-up observations were initiated to secure the detection and to derive the\nplanet mass. Results. We report the detection of CoRoT-5b, detected during\nobservations of the LRa01 field, the first long-duration field in the galactic\nanticenter direction.

Using a\nrelatively low order AO system, Strehl Ratios of larger than 95% have been\nreported on 6-8 meter class telescopes. Going to 30-42 meter class telescopes\nchanges this picture dramatically. High Strehl Ratios require what is currently\nconsidered a high-order AO system.

We then investigated its self-organising aspects,\nstarting with an extension to the definition of Physical Complexity to include\nevolving agent populations. Next, we established stability of evolving agent\npopulations over time, by extending the Chli-DeWilde definition of agent\nstability to include evolutionary dynamics. Further, we evaluated the diversity\nof the software agents within evolving agent populations. To conclude, we\nconsidered alternative augmentations to optimise and accelerate our Digital\nEcosystem, by studying the accelerating effect of a clustering catalyst on the\nevolutionary dynamics.

We determined the radial velocities (RV) of both components\nusing four different techniques. We disentangled the binary spectra using\nKOREL, and performed the first abundance analysis on both disentangled spectra.\nBy combining the spectroscopic results and the photometric data, we obtained\nthe component masses, 1.8 and 1.7 solar masses, and radii, 4.0 and 2.4 solar\nradii, for inclination i = 73.2 degrees, eccentricity e = 0.28, and orbital\nperiod 5.70198 days. Effective temperatures of 7600 K and 8100 K were also\ndetermined. The measured vsini are 78 and 74 km/s, respectively, giving\nrotational periods of 2.50 and 1.55 days for the components. The abundance\nanalysis shows [Fe/H] = -0.28 for the primary (pulsating) star, consistent with\nobservations of IC4756. We also present an assessment of the different analysis\ntechniques used to obtain the RVs and the global parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2009 13:34:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

While single power\nlaw models give a good description in the X-ray domain (mean photon index ~\n2.05) and MeV domain (photon index ~ 2.23), crucial information are contained\nin the evolution of the slope with energy between these two values.

The slopes measured below and above 100 keV agree\nperfectly with the last values reported in the X-ray and MeV regions\nrespectively, but without indication of a localized break point.
