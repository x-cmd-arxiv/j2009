We also study in detail several interesting examples of the\ncorrespondence for particular groups and show how to significantly simplify the\ngeneral stability condition in these cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2009 16:16:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2009 22:06:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 Aug 2012 20:12:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-17"}

Thus, this work is aimed at studying some of its polar\nproperties and their magnetic field dependence as well. The experimental\nresults here reported have shown that this material is very easily polarisable\nunder external electric fields, and so, whenever the polarization is obtained\nfrom time integration of the displacement currents, an induced polarization is\nsuperposed to the spontaneous one, eventually masking the occurrence of\nferroelectricity.

In the linear regime k < 0.1\nh/Mpc, the redshift space power spectrum is\n  P^s_{pk}(k,u) = exp(-f^2 s_{vel}^2 k^2 u^2) * [b_{pk}(k) + b_{vel}(k) f\nu^2]^2 * P_m(k), where u is the angle with respect to the line of sight,\ns_{vel} is the one-dimensional velocity dispersion, f is the growth rate, and\nb_{pk}(k) and b_{vel}(k) are k-dependent linear spatial and velocity bias\nfactors. For peaks, the value of s_{vel} depends upon the functional form of\nb_{vel}. The peaks model is remarkable because it has unbiased velocities --\npeak motions are driven by dark matter flows -- but, in order to achieve this,\nb_{vel} is k-dependent. We speculate that this is true in general: k-dependence\nof the spatial bias will lead to k-dependence of b_{vel} even if the biased\ntracers flow with the dark matter. Because of the k-dependence of the linear\nbias parameters, standard manipulations applied to the peak model will lead to\nk-dependent estimates of the growth factor that could erroneously be\ninterpreted as a signature of modified dark energy or gravity. We use the\nFisher formalism to show that the constraint on the growth rate f is degraded\nby a factor of two if one allows for a k-dependent velocity bias of the peak\ntype. We discuss a simple estimate of nonlinear evolution and illustrate the\neffect of the peak bias on the redshift space multipoles. For k < 0.1 h/Mpc,\nthe peak bias is deterministic but k-dependent, so the configuration space bias\nis stochastic and scale dependent, both in real and redshift space. We provide\nexpressions for this stochasticity and its evolution (abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2009 21:03:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 2009 21:11:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2009 08:42:49 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2010 14:07:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-06"}

In particular, the usual quantum\nmechanical wave function (a function on a high-dimensional configuration space)\nis not among the beables posited by the new theory. Instead, each particle has\nan associated ``pilot-wave'' field (living in physical space). A number of\nadditional fields (also fields on physical space) maintain what is described,\nin ordinary quantum theory, as ``entanglement.'' The theory allows some\ninteresting new perspective on the kind of causation involved in pilot-wave\ntheories in general. And it provides also a concrete example of an empirically\nviable quantum theory in whose formulation the wave function (on configuration\nspace) does not appear -- i.e., it is a theory according to which nothing\ncorresponding to the configuration space wave function need actually exist.\nThat is the theory's \\emph{raison d'etre} and perhaps its only virtue. Its\nvices include the fact that it only reproduces the empirical predictions of the\nordinary pilot-wave theory (equivalent, of course, to the predictions of\nordinary quantum theory) for spinless non-relativistic particles, and only then\nfor wave functions that are everywhere analytic. The goal is thus not to\nrecommend the TELB proposed here as a replacement for ordinary pilot-wave\ntheory (or ordinary quantum theory), but is rather to illustrate (with a crude\nfirst stab) that it might be possible to construct a plausible, empirically\nviable TELB, and to recommend this as an interesting and perhaps-fruitful\nprogram for future research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2009 21:11:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Jan 2010 19:56:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2010 14:21:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Previous\nstudies of bare surfaces showed that the atomic scale deviations from a sphere\nthat are present on any tip constructed from discrete atoms lead to significant\ndeviations from continuum theory and dramatic variability in friction forces.\nIntroducing an adsorbed monolayer leads to larger deviations from continuum\ntheory, but decreases the variations between tips with different atomic\nstructure. Although the film is fluid, it remains in the contact and behaves\nqualitatively like a thin elastic coating except for certain tips at high\nloads. Measures of the contact area based on the moments or outer limits of the\npressure distribution and on counting contacting atoms are compared. The number\nof tip atoms making contact in a time interval grows as a power of the interval\nwhen the film is present and logarithmically with the interval for bare\nsurfaces. Friction is measured by displacing the tip at a constant velocity or\npulling the tip with a spring. Both static and kinetic friction rise linearly\nwith load at small loads.

In this paper, we provide a new\nprovably-secure, private-key steganographic encryption protocol secure in the\nframework of Hopper et al. We first present a \"one-time stegosystem\" that\nallows two parties to transmit messages of length at most that of the shared\nkey with information-theoretic security guarantees. The employment of a\npseudorandom generator (PRG) permits secure transmission of longer messages in\nthe same way that such a generator allows the use of one-time pad encryption\nfor messages longer than the key in symmetric encryption. The advantage of our\nconstruction, compared to all previous work is randomness efficiency: in the\ninformation theoretic setting our protocol embeds a message of length n bits\nusing a shared secret key of length (1+o(1))n bits while achieving security\n2^{-n/log^{O(1)}n}; simply put this gives a rate of key over message that is 1\nas n tends to infinity (the previous best result achieved a constant rate\ngreater than 1 regardless of the security offered). In this sense, our protocol\nis the first truly randomness efficient steganographic system. Furthermore, in\nour protocol, we can permit a portion of the shared secret key to be public\nwhile retaining precisely n private key bits. In this setting, by separating\nthe public and the private randomness of the shared key, we achieve security of\n2^{-n}. Our result comes as an effect of the application of randomness\nextractors to stegosystem design.

All\nobservations were made with the AZT-22 1.5m telescope, SITe 2k CCD or Fairchild\n486 CCD, and standard Bessell UBVRI filters from 2003 August to 2007 September.\nWe observed many standard stars around the celestial equator observed by SAAO\nastronomers. The atmospheric extinction coefficients, photometric zero points,\nand time variation of photometric zero points of each night were determined.\nSecondary extinction coefficients and photometric zero points were very stable,\nwhile primary extinction coefficients showed a distinct seasonal variation. We\nalso determined the transformation coefficients for each filter. For B, V, R,\nand I filters, the transformation to the SAAO standard system could be achieved\nwith a straight line or a combination of two straight lines. However, in the\ncase of the U filter and Fairchild 486 CCD combination, a significant\nnon-linear correction term - related to the size of Balmer jump or the strength\nof the Balmer lines - of up to 0.08 mags was required. We found that our data\nmatched well the SAAO photometry in V, B-V, V-I, and R-I. But in U-B, the\ndifference in zero point was about 3.6 mmag and the scatter was about 0.02 mag.\nWe attribute the relatively large scatter in U-B to the larger error in U of\nthe SAAO photometry.

The\nfractional change in the resistance is as much as 70 % at room temperature for\nEth = 95 V/cm. The Eth increases with lowering Tb and follows the relation\nEth(Tb) = Eth(0)exp[-Tb/T0], as similar to the behavior found in charge density\nwave systems. It is shown that the abrupt jump in J vanishes under pulsed\nelectric fields if the period between pulses is long enough. Surprisingly, a\nstep-like increase in J also occurs at a fixed dc electric field (Ec) and T =\nTb, above a threshold waiting time (tth). The tth decreases with increasing Ec\nand Tb. Simultaneous measurement of surface temperature during the J-E sweep\nand temporal studies suggest that conductive channels are created in an\ninsulating matrix due to the local self heating, and the coalescence of these\nchannels above a threshold E- field or time causes the observed anomalies in J.\nHowever, the dissipated Joule power (P = Ith2R) at the transition from high to\nlow resistive state in the sample decreases with lowering temperature, which\nsuggests that the Joule heating is the consequence of transition from the high\nto low resistance state rather than itself a driving force of the non linear\nelectrical transport. In addition, non linear J-E characteristics is also found\neven with a pulsed voltage sweep, which suggests that intrinsic mechanisms\nother than self heating is still active in this material.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 2009 05:36:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-28"}

Another crossover number is proposed based\non the fidelity between the initial and final ground-states.

As examples, two models are studied: one\nwith free bosons in an harmonic trap which frequency is quenched, and the\none-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model, that is known to be non-integrable and for\nwhich recent studies have uncovered remarkable non-equilibrium behaviors.

The first transition separates a continuous\nmotion regime at comparatively low packing fractions and large dragging force\nfrom an intermittent motion one at high packing fraction and low dragging\nforce. Associated to these different motions, we observe a transition from a\nlinear rheology to a stiffer response. We thereby call \"fluidisation\" this\nfirst transition. A second transition is observed within the intermittent\nregime, when the intruder's motion is made of intermittent bursts separated by\nlong waiting times. We observe a peak in the relative fluctuations of the\nintruder's displacements and a critical scaling of the burst amplitudes\ndistributions. This transition occurs at the jamming point characterized in a\nprevious study and defined as the point where the static pressure (i.e. the\npressure measured in the absence of vibration) vanishes. Investigating the\nmotion of the surrounding grains, we show that below the fluidisation\ntransition, there is a permanent wake of free volume behind the intruder. This\ntransition is marked by the evolution of the reorganization patterns around the\nintruder, which evolve from compact aggregates in the flowing regime to\nlong-range branched shapes in the intermittent regime, suggesting an increasing\nrole of the stress fluctuations. Remarkably, the distributions of the kinetic\nenergy of these reorganization patterns also exhibits a critical scaling at the\njamming transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 2009 07:51:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-02"}

However, most modern multiprocessors depend on store\nbuffering for efficiency, and provide native sequential consistency only at a\nsubstantial performance penalty. To regain sequential consistency, a programmer\nhas to follow an appropriate programming discipline. However, na\\\"ive\ndisciplines, such as protecting all shared accesses with locks, are not\nflexible enough for building high-performance multiprocessor software.\n  We present a new discipline for concurrent programming under TSO (total store\norder, with store buffer forwarding). It does not depend on concurrency\nprimitives, such as locks. Instead, threads use ghost operations to acquire and\nrelease ownership of memory addresses. A thread can write to an address only if\nno other thread owns it, and can read from an address only if it owns it or it\nis shared and the thread has flushed its store buffer since it last wrote to an\naddress it did not own. This discipline covers both coarse-grained concurrency\n(where data is protected by locks) as well as fine-grained concurrency (where\natomic operations race to memory).\n  We formalize this discipline in Isabelle/HOL, and prove that if every\nexecution of a program in a system without store buffers follows the\ndiscipline, then every execution of the program with store buffers is\nsequentially consistent. Thus, we can show sequential consistency under TSO by\nordinary assertional reasoning about the program, without having to consider\nstore buffers at all.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 2009 08:45:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-28"}

We\nidentify four distinct sub-populations,namely metal-poor (MP,[Fe/H]<=-1.49),\nmetal-intermediate (MI,-1.49<[Fe/H]<=-0.93), metal-rich\n(MR,-0.95<[Fe/H]<=-0.15) and solar metallicity (SM,[Fe/H]~0). The last group\nincludes only a small fraction of stars (~8+/-5%) and should be confirmed\nspectroscopically. Moreover, using the difference in metallicity based on\ndifferent photometric indices, we find that the 19+/-1% of RGs are candidate\nCN-strong stars. This fraction agrees quite well with recent spectroscopic\nestimates and could imply a large fraction of binary stars. The Stroemgren\nmetallicity indices display a robust correlation with alpha-elements\n([Ca+Si/H]) when moving from the metal-intermediate to the metal-rich regime\n([Fe/H]>-1.7 dex).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 2009 13:37:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

This is due to the inverse iron-bias,\nwhich is not related to the presence in the spectrum of both Fe-L and Fe-K\nemission lines but to the behavior of the fitting code in shaping the Fe-L\ncomplex of a one temperature component to adjust to the multi-temperature\nstructure of the projected spectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 2009 13:23:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-28"}

Possible mass generating\nmechanisms including perturbative as well as non-perturbative effects are\ndiscussed and specific patterns of mass textures are found characterized by the\nhierarchies of the scales where the various sources contribute.

In the simplest class of inhomogeneous models, we live\nwithin a large, spherically symmetric void. Several studies have shown that\nsuch a model can be made consistent with many observations, in particular the\nredshift--luminosity distance relation for type Ia supernovae, provided that\nthe void is of Gpc size and that we live close to the center. Such a scenario\nchallenges the Copernican principle that we do not occupy a special place in\nthe universe. We use the first-year Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II supernova\nsearch data set as well as the Constitution supernova data set to put\nconstraints on the observer position in void models, using the fact that\noff-center observers will observe an anisotropic universe. We first show that a\nspherically symmetric void can give good fits to the supernova data for an\non-center observer, but that the two data sets prefer very different voids. We\nthen continue to show that the observer can be displaced at least fifteen\npercent of the void scale radius from the center and still give an acceptable\nfit to the supernova data. When combined with the observed dipole anisotropy of\nthe cosmic microwave background however, we find that the data compells the\nobserver to be located within about one percent of the void scale radius. Based\non these results, we conclude that considerable fine-tuning of our position\nwithin the void is needed to fit the supernova data, strongly disfavouring the\nmodel from a Copernican principle point of view.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 2009 15:32:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 May 2010 15:42:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}
