It is assumed that the channel states of each\nreceiver are randomly selected from $\\mathds{R}^{M\\times 1}$ (or from\n$\\mathds{C}^{M\\times 1}$). It is shown that no matter what $J_r$ is, the\ndegrees of freedom (DoF) of $\\frac{MK}{M+K-1}$ is achievable. The achievable\nscheme relies on the idea of interference alignment at receivers, without\nexploiting the possibility of cooperation among transmit antennas. It is proven\nthat if $J_r \\geq M$, $r=1,...,K$, this scheme achieves the optimal DoF. This\nresults implies that when the uncertainty of the base station about the channel\nrealization is considerable, the system loses the gain of cooperation. However,\nit still benefits from the gain of interference alignment. In fact, in this\ncase, the compound broadcast channel is treated as a compound X channel.\n  Moreover, it is shown that when the base station knows the channel states of\nsome of the receivers, a combination of transmit cooperation and interference\nalignment would achieve the optimal DoF.\n  Like time-invariant $K$-user interference channels, the naive vector-space\napproaches of interference management seem insufficient to achieve the optimal\nDoF of this channel. In this paper, we use the Number-Theory approach of\nalignment, recently developed by Motahari et al.[1].

In\nclassical and quantum theory, they are equal, being given by the Shannon and\nvon Neumann entropies respectively; in general, however, they are very\ndifferent. In particular, while measurement entropy is easily seen to be\nconcave, mixing entropy need not be. In fact, as we show, mixing entropy is not\nconcave whenever the state space is a non-simplicial polytope. Thus, the\ncondition that measurement and mixing entropies coincide is a strong constraint\non possible theories. We call theories with this property monoentropic.\nMeasurement entropy is subadditive, but not in general strongly subadditive.\nEquivalently, if we define the mutual information between two systems A and B\nby the usual formula I(A:B) = H(A) + H(B) - H(AB) where H denotes the\nmeasurement entropy and AB is a non-signaling composite of A and B, then it can\nhappen that I(A:BC) < I(A:B). This is relevant to information causality in the\nsense of Pawlowski et al.: we show that any monoentropic non-signaling theory\nin which measurement entropy is strongly subadditive, and also satisfies a\nversion of the Holevo bound, is informationally causal, and on the other hand\nwe observe that Popescu-Rohrlich boxes, which violate information causality,\nalso violate strong subadditivity.

We present a\nmethod to make such quantitative use of X-Ray and EUV images of coronal loops.\nEach individual loop is fit to a field line of a linear force-free field,\nallowing the estimation of the field line's twist, three-dimensional geometry\nand the field strength along it.\n  We assess the validity of such a reconstruction since the actual corona is\nprobably not a linear force-free field and that the superposition of linear\nforce-free fields is generally not itself a force-free field. To do so, we\nperform a series of tests on non-linear force-free fields, described in Low &\nLou (1990). For model loops we project field lines onto the photosphere. We\ncompare several results of the method with the original field, in particular\nthe three-dimensional loop shapes, local twist (coronal alpha), distribution of\ntwist in the model photosphere and strength of the magnetic field. We find\nthat, (i) for these trial fields, the method reconstructs twist with mean\nabsolute deviation of at most 15% of the range of photospheric twist, (ii) that\nheights of the loops are reconstructed with mean absolute deviation of at most\n5% of the range of trial heights and (iii) that the magnitude of non-potential\ncontribution to photospheric field is reconstructed with mean absolute\ndeviation of at most 10% of the maximal value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2009 17:01:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-29"}

We modeled the spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) of the stars with the strongest IR excess and find a total\ncluster dust mass-loss rate of 3.0(+2.0/-1.2) x 10^-9 solar masses per year,\ncorresponding to a gas mass-loss rate of 8.6(+5.6/-3.4) x 10^-6 solar masses\nper year, assuming [Fe/H] = -1.16. This mass loss is in addition to any\ndust-less mass loss that is certainly occurring within the cluster. The two\nmost extreme stars, variables V2 and V16, contribute up to 45% of the total\ncluster dust-traced mass loss. The SEDs of the more moderate stars indicate the\npresence of silicate dust, as expected for low-mass, low-metallicity stars.\nSurprisingly, the SED shapes of the stars with the strongest mass-loss rates\nappear to require the presence of amorphous carbon dust, possibly in\ncombination with silicate dust, despite their oxygen-rich nature. These results\ncorroborate our previous findings in omega Centauri.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2009 17:45:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

Non-standard models of Big Bang\nnucleosynthesis and pre-Galactic cosmic ray fusion and spallation have been\nproposed to explain these values. However, the observations of this light\nisotope are challenging which may make some detections disputable. The goal was\nto determine 6Li/7Li for a sample of metal-poor stars; three of them have been\npreviously studied and the remaining two are new for this type of study. The\npurpose was to increase, if possible, the number of lithium-6 detections and to\nconfirm previously published results. Spectra of the resonance doublet line of\nneutral lithium Li I 670.78nm were taken with the High Dispersion Spectrograph\nat the Subaru 8.2m-telescope for a sample of five metal-poor stars (-3.12 <\n[Fe/H] < -2.19). The contribution of lithium-6 to the total observed line\nprofile was estimated from the 1D-LTE analysis of the line asymmetry. Observed\nasymmetries could be reproduced assuming isotopic abundance ratios 6Li/7Li of\nthe order of: 0.004 for BD+26 3578, ~ 0.010 for BD+02 3375 and G 64-37, 0.025\nfor BD+20 3603 and 0.047 for BD-04 3208. We found that these results were very\nsensitive to several of the assumptions made in the analysis, in particular,\nthe treatment of the residual structure in the analysed spectra. Our final\nestimates for the errors are respectively delta_6Li/7Li=+- 0.028, 0.029, 0.039,\n0.025 and 0.039. The 6Li/7Li ratios for the sample are comparable to or even\nlower than these error values, so that detections of lithium-6 can not safely\nbe claimed despite of the high resolving power (R ~ 95 000) and S/N (400-600).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2009 18:18:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}

An\non-shell renormalisation scheme is worked out for the chargino-neutralino\nsector that properly takes account of imaginary parts arising from complex\nparameters and from absorptive parts of loop integrals. The genuine vertex\ncontributions to the neutralino decay amplitudes are combined with two-loop\npropagator-type corrections for the outgoing Higgs boson. In this way the\ncurrently most precise prediction for this class of processes is obtained. The\nnumerical impact of the genuine vertex corrections is studied for several\nexamples of CP-conserving and CP-violating scenarios. We find that significant\neffects on the decay widths and branching ratios are possible even in the\nCP-conserving MSSM.

This parameter region of the CPX scenario where a very\nlight Higgs boson is unexcluded by present data is analysed in detail. We find\nthat in this parameter region, which will be difficult to cover by standard\nHiggs search channels at the LHC, the branching ratio for the decay\nchi^0_2->chi^0_1 h_1 is large.

So far all\nFeBSC for which neutron data are available do demonstrate such excitations, and\nthe band structure calculations so far were finding quasi-nested FSs in all\nFeBSC, providing for a peak in the spin susceptibility at the desired wave\nvectors. However, the newest addition to the family, Sr$_{2}$VO$_{3}$FeAs, has\nbeen calculated to have a very complex FS with no visible quasi-nesting\nfeatures. It was argued therefore that this material does not fall under the\nexisting paradigm and calls for revisiting our current ideas about what is the\nlikely cause of superconductivity in FeBSC. In this paper, I show that the\nvisible complexity of the FS is entirely due to the V-derived electronic\nstates. Assuming that superconductivity in Sr$_{2}$VO$_{3}$FeAs, as in the\nother FeBSC, originates in the FeAs layers, and the superconducting electrons\nare sensitive to the susceptibility of the FeAs electronic subsystem, I\nrecalculate the bare susceptibility, weighting the electronic states with their\nFe character, and obtain a susceptibility that fully supports the existing\nquasi-nesting model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2009 19:50:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2009 19:03:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2010 23:08:28 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 20 Apr 2010 15:52:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

MOND, indeed, predicts a quasi-universal value of this quantity\nfor objects of all masses and of any internal structure, provided they are\nmostly in the Newtonian regime; i.e., that their mean acceleration is at or\nabove a0. The predicted value is qSm, with Sm= a0/2 pi G= 138 solar masses per\nsquare parsec for the nominal value of a0, and q a constant of order 1 that\ndepends only on the form of the MOND interpolating function. This gives in the\nabove units log(Sm)=2.14, which is consistent with that found by Doanato et al.\nof 2.15+-0.2. MOND predicts, on the other hand, that this quasi-universal value\nis not shared by objects with much lower mean accelerations. It permits halo\ncentral surface densities that are arbitrarily small, if the mean acceleration\ninside the object is small enough. However, for such low-surface-density\nobjects, MOND predicts a halo surface density that scales as the square root of\nthe baryonic one, and so the range of the former is much compressed relative to\nthe latter. This explains, in part, the finding of Donato et al. that the\nuniversal value applies to low acceleration systems as well. Looking at\nliterature results for a number of the lowest surface-density disk galaxies\nwith rotation-curve analysis, I find that, indeed, their halo surface densities\nare systematically lower then the above \"universal\" value. The prediction of Sm\nas an upper limit, and accumulation value, of halo central surface densities,\npertains, unlike most other MOND predictions, to a pure \"halo\" property, not to\na relation between baryonic and \"dark matter\" properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2009 20:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

We\nsystematically vary the parameters of the model to determine which physical\nprocesses are dominant and which aspects of the model are robust. Generically,\nwe find that SF is limited by the build-up of dark matter haloes at high\nredshift, reaches a broad maximum at intermediate redshift, then decreases as\nit is quenched by lower cooling rates in hotter and lower density gas, gas\nexhaustion, and self-regulated feedback from stars and black holes. The higher\nredshift SF is therefore mostly determined by the cosmological parameters and\nto a lesser extent by photo-heating from reionization. The location and height\nof the peak in the SF history, and the steepness of the decline towards the\npresent, depend on the physics and implementation of stellar and black hole\nfeedback. Mass loss from intermediate-mass stars and metal-line cooling both\nboost the SF rate at late times. Galaxies form stars in a self-regulated\nfashion at a rate controlled by the balance between, on the one hand, feedback\nfrom massive stars and black holes and, on the other hand, gas cooling and\naccretion. Paradoxically, the SF rate is highly insensitive to the assumed SF\nlaw. This can be understood in terms of self-regulation: if the SF efficiency\nis changed, then galaxies adjust their gas fractions so as to achieve the same\nrate of production of massive stars. Self-regulated feedback from accreting\nblack holes is required to match the steep decline in the observed SF rate\nbelow redshift two, although more extreme feedback from SF, for example in the\nform of a top-heavy IMF at high gas pressures, can help.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2009 22:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2009 14:10:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-07"}

The spectral index images allowed us to study the integrated\nspectrum of halo and relic and to investigate the physical properties of the\nBeaver head-tail radio galaxy belonging to the cluster. In the radio halo, the\nspectral index is steeper at the center and flatter at the locations of the\nradio filaments, clearly detected at 25 cm. In the relics, the spectral index\nflattens, moving away from the cluster center. For the Beaver radio galaxy, the\nspectrum severely steepens from the head towards the end of the tail, because\nof the energy losses suffered by the relativistic particles. In the 2 m map,\nwhich is the first high-sensitivity image presented in the literature at such a\nlong wavelength, a new Mpc-size emission region is detected between the known\nradio halo and the NW relic.

The\ninfluence of the tree structure and the parameters of the Gaussian distribution\non the learning rate as the number of samples increases is discussed.\nSpecifically, the error exponent corresponding to the event that the estimated\ntree structure differs from the actual unknown tree structure of the\ndistribution is analyzed. Finding the error exponent reduces to a least-squares\nproblem in the very noisy learning regime. In this regime, it is shown that the\nextremal tree structure that minimizes the error exponent is the star for any\nfixed set of correlation coefficients on the edges of the tree. If the\nmagnitudes of all the correlation coefficients are less than 0.63, it is also\nshown that the tree structure that maximizes the error exponent is the Markov\nchain. In other words, the star and the chain graphs represent the hardest and\nthe easiest structures to learn in the class of tree-structured Gaussian\ngraphical models. This result can also be intuitively explained by correlation\ndecay: pairs of nodes which are far apart, in terms of graph distance, are\nunlikely to be mistaken as edges by the maximum-likelihood estimator in the\nasymptotic regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2009 20:49:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Jan 2010 02:26:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-06"}

As shown previously, the brightest 1.3 mm\nsource SMA1 contains substructure at subarcsecond resolution, and we report the\nfirst detection of SMA1b at 3.6 cm along with a new spatial component at 7 mm\n(SMA1d). We find SMA1 (aggregate of sources a, b, c, and d) and SMA4 to be\ncomprised of free-free and dust components, while SMA6 shows only dust\nemission. Our 1.5\" resolution 1.3 mm molecular line images reveal substantial\nhot-core line emission toward SMA1 and to a lesser degree SMA2. We find CH3OH\nrotation temperatures of 165\\pm 9 K and 145\\pm 12 K for SMA1 and SMA2,\nrespectively. We estimate a diameter of 1400 AU for the SMA1 hot core emission,\nencompassing both SMA1b and SMA1d, and speculate that these sources comprise a\n>800 AU separation binary that may explain the previously-suggested precession\nof the outflow emanating from the SMA1 region. The LSR velocities of SMA1,\nSMA2, and SMA4 all differ by 1-2 km/s. Outflow activity from SMA1, SMA2, SMA4,\nand SMA6 is observed in several molecules including SiO(5--4) and IRAC 4.5\nmicron emission; 24 micron emission from SMA4 is also detected. Eleven water\nmaser groups are detected, eight of which coincide with SMA1, SMA2, SMA4, and\nSMA6. We also detect a total of 83 Class I CH3OH 44GHz maser spots which likely\nresult from the combined activity of many outflows.

Among other results, they proved a characterization of\nmaximal Tutte sets in terms of maximal independent sets in the graph $D(G)$ and\nmaximal extreme sets in $G$.

The\nKac-Kubilius model suggests that the distribution of values of a given additive\nfunction can be modeled by a sum of random variables. We show that the model is\naccurate (in a large deviation sense) when one is looking at values of the\nadditive function around its mean, but fails, by a constant multiple, for large\nvalues of the additive function. We believe that this phenomenon arises,\nbecause the model breaks down for the values of the additive function on the\n\"large\" primes.\n  In the second part of the paper, we are motivated by a question of Elliott,\nto understand how much the distribution of values of the additive function on\nprimes determines, and is determined by, the distribution of values of the\nadditive function on all of the integers. For example, our main theorem,\nimplies that a positive, strongly additive function is roughly Poisson\ndistributed on the integers if and only if it is $1+o(1)$ or $o(1)$ on almost\nall primes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2009 06:47:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2009 06:07:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2009 08:09:52 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2011 21:09:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-02"}

Such SMW\njets are assumed as initial conditions in some numerical simulations that\ndemonstrate that SMW jets can expel the rest of the collapsing star. The\noriginal fast narrow jets must deposit their energy inside the star via shock\nwaves, and form two hot bubbles that accelerate a much larger mass to form SMW\njets. To prevent the jets from penetrating through the still infalling gas and\nescape instead of forming the hot bubbles, the jets should encounter fresh\ninfalling gas. This condition is met if the jets' axis changes its direction.\nThe exact condition is derived. In addition, to maintain a small neutrino\ncooling the fast narrow jets must be shocked at a distance r>1000 km from the\ncore, such that most of the post-shock energy is in radiation, and temperature\nis not too high.

Its effects include the erasing of memory\nwith respect to the initial condition, a partial attenuation of geometrically\noriginated instabilities, and the restoring of universality in some special\ncases in which the critical exponents depend on the parameters of the equation\nof motion. In this sense, dilution rends the dynamics more similar to the usual\none of planar systems.

These solutions exist for a wide range of disk-to-black hole mass\nratios $M_d/M_{bh}$, can span large warp angles of up to $\\pm\\sim 120\\deg$,\nhave inner and outer boundaries, and extend over a radial range of a factor of\ntypically two to four.

Two kinds of cloaks have\nbeen proposed: free-space cloaks, which can render objects in free space\ninvisible to incident radiation, and carpet cloaks (or ground cloaks), which\ncan hide objects under the conducting ground. The first free-space and carpet\ncloaks were realized in the microwave frequencies using metamaterials. The\nfree-space cloak was composed of resonant metamaterials, and hence had\nrestriction of narrow bandwidth and high loss; the carpet cloak was made of\nnon-resonant metamaterials, which have broad bandwidth and low loss. However,\nthe carpet cloak has a severe restriction of large size compared to the cloaked\nobject. The above restrictions become the bottlenecks to the real applications\nof free-space and carpet cloaks.

Considering circular motion they\nshowed that the twin with a non-vanishing 4-acceleration is older than his\nbrother at the reunion and argued that in spaces that are asymptotically\nMinkowskian there exists an absolute standard of rest determining which twin is\noldest at the reunion. Here we show that with vertical motion in Schwarzschild\nspacetime the result is opposite: The twin with a non-vanishing 4-acceleration\nis younger. We also deduce the existence of a new relativistic time effect,\nthat there is either a time dilation or an increased rate of time associated\nwith a clock moving in a rotating frame. This is in fact a first order effect\nin the velocity of the clock, and must be taken into account if the situation\npresented by Abramowicz and Bajtlik is described from the rotating rest frame\nof one of the twins. Our analysis shows that this effect has a Machian\ncharacter since the rotating state of a frame depends upon the motion of the\ncosmic matter due to the inertial dragging it causes. We argue that a\nconsistent formulation and resolution of the twin paradox makes use of the\ngeneral principle of relativity and requires the introduction of an extended\nmodel of the Minkowski spacetime. In the extended model Minkowski spacetime is\nsupplied with a cosmic shell of matter with radius equal to its own\nSchwarzschild radius, so that there is perfect inertial dragging inside the\nshell.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2009 15:42:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2009 15:55:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2010 13:49:36 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2011 09:20:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-21"}

We formulate this as the problem of prior-free auction and\nfocus on designing a simple mechanism that always allocates the item. Rather\nthan designing sophisticated pricing methods like prior literature, we design\nbetter allocation methods. In particular, we propose quasi-proportional\nallocation methods in which the probability that an item is allocated to a\nbidder depends (quasi-proportionally) on the bids.\n  We prove that corresponding games for both all-pay and winners-pay\nquasi-proportional mechanisms admit pure Nash equilibria and this equilibrium\nis unique. We also give an algorithm to compute this equilibrium in polynomial\ntime. Further, we show that the revenue of the auctioneer is promisingly high\ncompared to the ultimate, i.e., the highest value of any of the bidders, and\nshow bounds on the revenue of equilibria both analytically, as well as using\nexperiments for specific quasi-proportional functions.
