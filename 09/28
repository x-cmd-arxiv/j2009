In the Sakai-Sugimoto model, which in a certain\nlimit is dual to large-N_c QCD, we discuss the proper implementation of the QED\naxial anomaly, the (ambiguous) definition of chiral currents, and the\ncalculation of the chiral magnetic effect.

We do not detect X-ray or radio\nemission from any of the three sources, despite previous detections of radio\nemission from BRI0021 and 2M0523-14. Steady and variable H-alpha emission are\ndetected from 2M0523-14 and BRI0021, respectively, while no H-alpha emission is\ndetected from LSR0602+39. Overall, our survey of nine M8-L5 dwarfs doubles the\nnumber of ultracool dwarfs observed in X-rays, and triples the number of L\ndwarfs, providing in addition the deepest limits to date, log(L_X/L_bol)<-5.\nWith this larger sample we find the first clear evidence for a substantial\nreduction in X-ray activity, by about two orders of magnitude, from mid-M to\nmid-L dwarfs. We find that the decline in both X-rays and H-alpha roughly\nfollows L_{X,Halpha}/L_bol ~ 10^[-0.4x(SP-M6)] for SP>M6. In the radio band,\nhowever, the luminosity remains relatively unchanged from M0 to L4, leading to\na substantial increase in L_rad/L_bol. Our survey also provides the first\ncomprehensive set of simultaneous radio/X-ray/H-alpha observations of ultracool\ndwarfs, and reveals a clear breakdown of the radio/X-ray correlation beyond\nspectral type M7, evolving smoothly from L_{\\nu,rad}/L_X ~ 10^-15.5 to\n~10^-11.5 Hz^-1 over the narrow spectral type range M7-M9. This breakdown\nreflects the substantial reduction in X-ray activity beyond M7, but its\nphysical origin remains unclear since, as evidenced by the uniform radio\nemission, there is no drop in the field dissipation and particle acceleration\nefficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Sep 2009 17:02:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

We support this hypothesis by a calculation\nof additive self helicity of a twisted flux tube from the simulation of Fan and\nGibson (2003). As more twist gets introduced, the additive self helicity\nincreases, and the kink instability of the tube coincides with the drop of\nadditive self helicity, after the latter reaches the value of\n$H_A/\\Phi^2\\approx 1.5$ (where $\\Phi$ is the flux of the tube and $H_A$ is\nadditive self helicity).\n  We compare additive self helicity to twist for a thin sub-portion of the tube\nto illustrate that $H_A/\\Phi^2$ is equal to the twist number, studied by Berger\nand Field (1984), when the thin flux tube approximation is applicable.

The\nrequired feedback of channel state information (CSI) can potentially result in\nexcessive overhead especially for high mobility or many antennas. This work\nconcerns efficient feedback for transmit beamforming and establishes a new\napproach of controlling feedback for maximizing net throughput, defined as\nthroughput minus average feedback cost. The feedback controller using a\nstationary policy turns CSI feedback on/off according to the system state that\ncomprises the channel state and transmit beamformer. Assuming channel isotropy\nand Markovity, the controller's state reduces to two scalars. This allows the\noptimal control policy to be efficiently computed using dynamic programming.\nConsider the perfect feedback channel free of error, where each feedback\ninstant pays a fixed price. The corresponding optimal feedback control policy\nis proved to be of the threshold type. This result holds regardless of whether\nthe controller's state space is discretized or continuous. Under the\nthreshold-type policy, feedback is performed whenever a state variable\nindicating the accuracy of transmit CSI is below a threshold, which varies with\nchannel power. The practical finite-rate feedback channel is also considered.\nThe optimal policy for quantized feedback is proved to be also of the threshold\ntype. The effect of CSI quantization is shown to be equivalent to an increment\non the feedback price. Moreover, the increment is upper bounded by the expected\nlogarithm of one minus the quantization error. Finally, simulation shows that\nfeedback control increases net throughput of the conventional periodic feedback\nby up to 0.5 bit/s/Hz without requiring additional bandwidth or antennas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2009 01:14:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The normal Hall coefficients (R_H_) have positive values\nwith magnitude of 1 - 1.5 x 10^-3^ cm^3^/C at room temperature for the all\nsamples. With decreasing temperature, we find two characteristic types of\nbehavior in R_H_(T) depending on T_c_.

On the other hand for the films with higher T_c_\n(typically T_c_ > 9 K), R_ H_ leaves almost unchanged down to T = 100 K, and\nthen starts decreasing toward a negative side. Around the temperatures when\nR_H_ changes its sign from positive to negative, obvious nonlinearity is\nobserved in the field-dependence of Hall resistance as to keep the low-field\nR_H_ positive while the high-field R_H_ negative. Thus the electronic state\njust above T_c_ is characterized by n_e_ (electron density) > n_h_ (hole\ndensity) with keeping \\mu_e_ < \\mu_h_.

Our aim is to better understand the disk-locking\nscenario in very low-mass stars. We have derived radial velocities, vsini, and\nfull width at 10% of the Halpha emission peak. Using published measurements of\ninfrared excess as disk tracer, and equivalent width of the NIR CaII line\nlambda8542, mid-IR difference [3.6]-[8.0]micron derived by Spitzer data, and\n10% Halpha width as diagnostic of the level of accretion, we have looked for\nany correlation between vsini divided by the radius and presence of disk and\naccretion. Four low-mass stars are SB2 systems. The distribution of rotation\nperiods derived from our vsini measurements is unimodal with a peak of few\ndays. Our <sini> is lower than the one expected for a random distribution. We\nfind no evidence for a population of fast rotators close to the break-up\nvelocity. A clear correlation between vsini/R and Delta(Ic-K) has been found.\nWhile for stars with no circumstellar disk a spread in the rotation rates is\nseen, stars with a circumstellar disk show an abrupt drop in their rotation\nrates by a factor of ~5. On the other hand, only a partial correlation between\nvsini and accretion is observed when other indicators are used. The X-ray\ncoronal activity level shows no dependence on vsini/R suggesting that all stars\nare in a saturated regime limit. The critical velocity is probably below our\nvsini detection limit of 9 km/s. The ONC low-mass stars in our sample at\npresent seem to be not locked, but the clear correlation we find between\nrotation and IR color excess suggests that they were locked once.

This requires\na characteristics of the source to be a standard candle. We show that contrary\nto earlier indications the accumulated data speak against this possibility.\nAnother method would be to use correlation between a distance dependent and a\ndistance independent variable to measure distance and determine cosmological\nparameters as is done using Cepheid variables and to some extent Type Ia\nsupernovae. Many papers have dealt with the use of so called Amati relation,\nfirst predicted by Lloyd, Petrosian and Mallozzi, or the Ghirlanda relation for\nthis purpose. We have argued that these procedure involve many unjustified\nassumptions which if not true could invalidate the results. In particular, we\npoint out that many evolutionary effects can affect the final outcome. In\nparticular, we demonstrate that the existing data from Swift and other earlier\nsatellites show that the gamma-ray burst may have undergone luminosity\nevolution. Similar evolution may be present for other variables such as the\npeak photon energy of the total radiated energy. Another out come of our\nanalysis is determination of the luminosity function and the comoving rate\nevolution of gamma-ray bursts which does not seem to agree with the cosmic star\nformation rate. We caution however, that the above result are preliminary and\nincludes primarily the effect of detection threshold. Other selection effects,\nperhaps less important than this, are also known to be present and must be\naccounted for.

We give a detailed derivation of a wormlike bundle model as a\ngeneric description for the statics and dynamics of polymer bundles consisting\nof semiflexible polymers interconnected by crosslinking agents. The elastic\ndegrees of freedom include bending as well as twist deformations of the\nfilaments and shear deformation of the crosslinks. We show that a competition\nbetween the elastic properties of the filaments and those of the crosslinks\nleads to renormalized effective bend and twist rigidities that become\nmode-number dependent. The strength and character of this dependence is found\nto vary with bundle architecture, such as the arrangement of filaments in the\ncross section and pretwist. We discuss two paradigmatic cases of bundle\narchitecture, a uniform arrangement of filaments as found in F-actin bundles\nand a shell-like architecture as characteristic for microtubules.

The two molecular magnets consist of\nCuII(saldmen)(H2O)}6{FeIII(CN)6}](ClO4)38H2O in short Cu6Fe and the analog\ncompound with cobalt, Cu6Co. It is found that in Cu6Fe whose magnetic core is\nconstituted by six Cu2+ ions and one Fe3+ ion all with s=1/2, a weak\nferromagnetic interaction between Cu2+ moments through the central Fe3+ ion\nwith J = 0.14 K is present, while in Cu6Co the Co3+ ion is diamagnetic and the\nweak interaction is antiferromagnetic with J = -1.12 K. The NMR spectra show\nthe presence of non equivalent groups of protons with a measurable contact\nhyperfine interaction consistent with a small admixture of s-wave function with\nthe d-function of the magnetic ion.

Accelerations are measured from the apparent motion of individual\njet features or \"components\" which may represent patterns in the jet flow. We\nfind that significant accelerations are common both parallel and perpendicular\nto the observed component velocities. Parallel accelerations, representing\nchanges in apparent speed, are generally larger than perpendicular acceleration\nthat represent changes in apparent direction. The trend for larger parallel\naccelerations indicates that a significant fraction of these changes in\napparent speed are due to changes in intrinsic speed of the component rather\nthan changes in direction to the line of sight. We find an overall tendency for\ncomponents with increasing apparent speed to be closer to the base of their\njets than components with decreasing apparent speed. This suggests a link\nbetween the observed pattern motions and the underlying flow which, in some\ncases, may increase in speed close to the base and decrease in speed further\nout; however, common hydro-dynamical processes for propagating shocks may also\nplay a role. About half of the components show \"non-radial\" motion, or a\nmisalignment between the component's structural position angle and its velocity\ndirection, and these misalignments generally better align the component motion\nwith the downstream emission. Perpendicular accelerations are closely linked\nwith non-radial motion. When observed together, perpendicular accelerations are\nusually in the correct direction to have caused the observed misalignment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2009 15:26:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-20"}

Our primary\nresource is the Hamburg/ESO Survey (HES), which provides a well-defined sample\nof more than 300 optically bright AGN with redshifts z<0.3 and blue magnitudes\nB<17.5. AGN luminosities were estimated in two ways, always taking care to\nminimise photometric biases due to host galaxy light contamination. Firstly, we\nmeasured broad-band B_J (blue) magnitudes of the objects over small apertures\nof the size of the seeing disk. Secondly, we extracted H alpha and H beta broad\nemission line luminosities from the spectra which should be entirely free of\nany starlight contribution. The resulting AGN luminosity function (AGNLF) is\nconsistent with a single power law, also when considering the effects of number\ndensity evolution within the narrow redshift range. We compared our AGNLF with\nthe H alpha luminosity function of lower luminosity Seyfert 1 galaxies by Hao\net al. (2005) and found a smooth transition between both, with excellent\nagreement in the overlapping region. From the combination of HES and SDSS\nsamples we constructed a single local AGNLF spanning more than 4 orders of\nmagnitude in luminosity. It shows only mild curvature which can be well\ndescribed as a double power law with slope indices of -2.0 for the faint end\nand -2.8 for the bright end. We predicted the local AGNLF in the soft X-ray\ndomain and compared this to recent literature data. We also compared the local\nAGNLF with results obtained at higher redshifts and find strong evidence for\nluminosity-dependent evolution, in the sense that AGN with luminosities around\nM_B~-19 are as common in the local universe as they were at z=1.5, supporting\nthe 'AGN downsizing' picture (abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2009 15:31:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The broadening of the outgoing nucleons due to nucleon-nucleon\ninteractions is taken into account by spectral functions. Long range (RPA)\ncorrelations renormalizing the electroweak strength in the medium are also\nincorporated. The background from resonance excitation events that do not lead\nto pions in the final state is also predicted by propagating the outgoing\nhadrons with the Giessen semiclassical BUU model in coupled channels (GiBUU).\nWe achieve a good description of the shape of the CCQE Q2 distribution\nextracted from data by MiniBooNE, thanks to the inclusion of RPA correlations,\nbut underestimate the integrated cross section when the standard value of MA =\n1 GeV is used. Possible reasons for this mismatch are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2009 15:41:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

These\nso-called persister cells keep themselves in a dormant state and thus are\ninsensitive to antibiotic treatment, resulting in serious problems of drug\nresistance. In this paper, we proposed a novel strategy to \"kill\" persister\ncells by triggering them to switch, in a fast and synchronized way, into\nnormally growing cells that are susceptible to antibiotics. The strategy is\nbased on resonant activation (RA), a well-studied phenomenon in physics where\nthe internal noise of a system can constructively facilitate fast and\nsynchronized barrier crossings. Through stochastic Gilliespie simulation with a\ngeneric toggle switch model, we demonstrated that RA exists in the phenotypic\nswitching of a single bacterium. Further, by coupling single cell level and\npopulation level simulations, we showed that with RA, one can greatly reduce\nthe time and total amount of antibiotics needed to sterilize a bacterial\npopulation. We suggest that resonant activation is a general phenomenon in\nphenotypic transition, and can find other applications such as cancer therapy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2009 15:47:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 2010 17:02:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-11"}
