One of the characteristic features is the\nconcomitant divergence of order-parameter and uniform fluctuations in contrast\nto the conventional quantum critical point (QCP). Several puzzling\nnon-Fermi-liquid properties are referred to be accounted for as in the cases of\nYbRh2Si2, CeRu2Si2 and beta-YbAlB4. Another more dramatic unconventionality\nappears in this case for topological transitions such as metal-insulator and\nLifshitz transitions.

The MQCP has a unique feature by a combined\ncharacter of symmetry-breaking and topological transitions.

This interaction is\nusually derived assuming that the perturber has a constant velocity. In\nrealistic situations, motion is accelerated as for instance by dynamical\nfriction itself. Here, we study the effect of acceleration on the dynamical\nfriction force. We characterize the density enhancement associated with a\nconstantly accelerating perturber with rectilinear motion in an infinite\nhomogeneous gaseous medium and show that dynamical friction is not a local\nforce and that its amplitude may depend on the perturber's initial velocity.\nThe force on an accelerating perturber is maximal between Mach 1 and Mach 2,\nwhere it is smaller than the corresponding uniform motion friction. In the\nlimit where the perturber's size is much smaller than the distance needed to\nchange the Mach number by unity through acceleration, a subsonic perturber\nfeels a force similar to uniform motion friction only if its past history does\nnot include supersonic episodes. Once an accelerating perturber reaches large\nsupersonic speeds, accelerated motion friction is marginally stronger than\nuniform motion friction. The force on a decelerating supersonic perturber is\nweaker than uniform motion friction as the velocity decreases to a few times\nthe sound speed.

When this happens, an alert is issued to the four ROTSE-III\ntelescopes, which immediately observe the corresponding region in the sky.\nImage subtraction is applied to the optical data to find transient objects. In\naddition, neutrino multiplets are investigated online for temporal and\ndirectional coincidence with gamma-ray satellite observations issued over the\nGamma-Ray Burst Coordinate Network. An overview of the full program is given,\nfrom the online selection of neutrino events to the automated follow-up, and\nthe resulting sensitivity to transient neutrino sources is presented for the\nfirst time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2009 11:44:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-15"}

In this paper we derive end-to-end performance bounds for a through\nflow in a network of tandem queues under fBm cross traffic. To this end, we\nprove a rigorous sample path envelope for fBm that complements previous\napproximate results.

We also\nmonitor the dynamics of MS packings along geometrical families by applying\nquasistatic simple shear strain at zero pressure. For small numbers of\nparticles (N < 16), we find that the dynamics is deterministic and highly\ncontracting. That is, if the system is initialized in a MS packing at a given\nshear strain, it will quickly lock into a periodic orbit at subsequent shear\nstrain, and therefore sample only a very small fraction of the possible MS\npackings in steady state. In studies with N>16, we observe an increase in the\nperiod and random splittings of the trajectories caused by bifurcations in\nconfiguration space.

The final part of the thesis\ndeals with quantum information transfer in arrays of permanently coupled\ndipolar systems.

The cosmological simulations are performed for a set of clusters\nusing a version of the TreePM-SPH Gadget code that follows chemo-dynamical\nevolution by accounting for metal enrichment by different stellar populations.\nBesides runs not including any efficient form of energy feedback, we carry out\nsimulations including: (i) kinetic feedback in the form of galactic winds\ntriggered by supernova explosions; (ii) AGN feedback from gas accretion onto\nsuper-massive black holes (BHs); (iii) AGN feedback in which a 'radio mode' is\nincluded. We find that AGN feedback is able to quench star formation in the\nbrightest cluster galaxies at z<4 and provides correct temperature profiles in\nthe central regions of galaxy groups. However, its effect is not sufficient to\ncreate cool cores in massive clusters. AGN feedback creates a widespread\nenrichment in the outskirts of clusters, thanks to its efficiency in displacing\nenriched gas from galactic halos to the inter-galactic medium at relatively\nhigh redshift. Iron abundance profiles are in better agreement with\nobservations, with a more pristine enrichment of the ICM around and beyond the\ncluster virial regions. From the pattern of the relative abundances of Silicon\nand Iron, we conclude that a significant fraction of ICM enrichment in\nsimulations is contributed by a diffuse population of intra-cluster stars. Our\nsimulations also predict that profiles of Z_Si/Z_Fe abundance ratio do not\nincrease at least out to 0.5 R_vir. Our results clearly show that different\nsources of energy feedback leave distinct imprints in the enrichment pattern of\nthe ICM, that are more evident when looking at cluster external regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2009 14:27:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

There is a natural notion of depth\nthat goes with a Stanley decomposition, called the Stanley depth. Stanley\nconjectured that the Stanley depth of a module $M$ is always at least the\n(classical) depth of $M$. In this paper we introduce a weaker type of\ndecomposition, which we call Hilbert decomposition, since it only depends on\nthe Hilbert function of $M$, and an analogous notion of depth, called Hilbert\ndepth. Since Stanley decompositions are Hilbert decompositions, the latter set\nupper bounds to the existence of Stanley decompositions. The advantage of\nHilbert decompositions is that they are easier to find. We test our new notion\non the syzygy modules of the residue class field of $K[X_1,...,X_n]$ (as usual\nidentified with $K$). Writing $M(n,k)$ for the $k$-th syzygy module, we show\nthat theHilbert depth of M(n,1) is $\\lfloor(n+1)/2\\rfloor$. Furthermore, we\nshow that, for $n > k \\ge \\lfloor n/2\\rfloor$, the Hilbert depth of $M(n,k)$ is\nequal to $n-1$. We conjecture that the same holds for the Stanley depth. For\nthe range $n/2 > k > 1$, it seems impossible to come up with a compact formula\nfor the Hilbert depth. Instead, we provide very precise asymptotic results as\n$n$ becomes large.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2009 15:29:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Apr 2010 18:02:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-19"}

Pion and rho-meson, diquark, nucleon and delta-baryon masses\nare obtained as self-consistent solutions of the respective equations for\n$q\\bar{q}$, $qq$, $qqq$ and $q(qq)$ systems. The common parenthesis is given by\na rainbow-ladder truncation in the quark-(anti-)quark channel. It includes an\neffective quark-gluon coupling as the only phenomenological input and inherent\nlink in the calculation of meson and baryon observables.\n  Results for hadron masses and the pion's and nucleon's static electromagnetic\nproperties as a function of a self-consistently calculated pion mass are\npresented and compared to lattice results and their chiral extrapolations. The\nevolution of the nucleon electromagnetic form factors with larger photon\nmomentum is investigated. The impact of further contributions beyond\nrainbow-ladder, e.g. pionic corrections, and possible future applications are\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2009 15:29:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-07"}
