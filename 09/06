In this paper we argue\nthat relativistic observers are subject to the same quantum illusions as in the\nEuclidean case: even though motion is discrete and respects no built-in 'arrow\nof time', observers have no choice but to perceive particle trajectories as\ncontinuous paths in spacetime.\n  Whereas the relativistic theories presuppose continuous paths as part of\ntheir axioms, the illusion of continuity allows us to replace this axiom with a\nlower-level quantum-inspired axiom concerning discrete jumps in spacetime. We\ninvestigate the nature of these jumps, and how far they can be tied to the\nunderlying geometric structure of spacetime. In particular, we consider hops\nwhich preserve features of the underlying number field, and investigate the\nextent to which all hops can be restricted to be of this form.\n  We conclude that hop-based motion can also be regarded as an illusion, one\ncaused by modelling physics in the 'wrong' number system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Sep 2009 22:51:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-08"}

The geometric measure of entanglement as a function of\nstate parameters can have different expressions. Each of expressions has its\nown applicable domain and thus the whole state parameter space is divided into\nsubspaces that are ranges of definition for corresponding expressions. The\npurpose of this paper is to examine the applicable domains for the most general\nqubit-interchange symmetric three-qubit states. First, we compute the\neigenvalues of the non-linear eigenvalue equations and the nearest separable\nstates for the permutation invariant three-qubit states with a fixed phase.\nNext, we compute the geometric entanglement measure, deduce the boundaries of\nall subspaces, and find allocations of highly and slightly entangled states. It\nis shown that there are three applicable domains when the phase factor is\n$\\pi/2$ while other cases have only two domains. The emergence of the three\ndomains is due to the appearance of the additional W-state. We show that most\nof highly entangled states reside near the boundaries of the domains and states\nlocated far from the boundaries become less-entangled and eventually go to the\nproduct states. The neighbors of W-state are generally more entangled than the\nneighbors of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger(GHZ) state from the aspect of the\ngeometric measure. However, the range of the GHZ-neighbors is much more wider\nthan the range of the W-neighbors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Sep 2009 13:05:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-08"}

These fields were previously found to contain\noverdensities of Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) or spectroscopic Lyman alpha\nemitters. We use HST and Spitzer data to infer stellar masses, and contrast our\nresults with large samples of LBGs in more average environments as probed by\nthe Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS). The following results were\nobtained. First, LBGs in both overdense regions and in the field at z=4-5 lie\non a very similar sequence in a z'-[3.6] versus [3.6] color-magnitude diagram.\nThis is interpreted as a sequence in stellar mass (log[M*/Msun] = 9-11) in\nwhich galaxies become increasingly red due to dust and age as their star\nformation rate (SFR) increases. Second, the two radio galaxies are among the\nmost massive objects (log[M*/Msun]~11) known to exist at z~4-5, and are\nextremely rare based on the low number density of such objects as estimated\nfrom the ~25x larger area GOODS survey. We suggest that the presence of these\nmassive galaxies and supermassive black holes has been boosted through rapid\naccretion of gas or merging inside overdense regions. Third, the total stellar\nmass found in the z=4 ``proto-cluster'' TN1338 accounts for <30% of the stellar\nmass on the cluster red sequence expected to have formed at z>4, based on a\ncomparison with the massive X-ray cluster Cl1252 at z=1.2. Although future\nnear-infrared observations should determine whether any massive galaxies are\ncurrently being missed, one possible explanation for this mass difference is\nthat TN1338 evolves into a smaller cluster than Cl1252. This raises the\ninteresting question of whether the most massive protocluster regions at z>4\nremain yet to be discovered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Sep 2009 13:55:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}
