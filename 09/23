Their high frequency in low\ndensity environments suggests that such episodes could drive the evolution of\nat least a fraction of the early-type galaxy population. Their UV emission is\ncrucial to test whether these galaxies host ongoing/recent star formation. We\nused far and near ultraviolet, optical, near infrared images, HI maps, and line\nstrength indices to investigate the nuclear and outer regions of the galaxies\nas well as the regions where fine structures are present. The GALEX Near (NUV)\nand Far UV (FUV) images of MCG-05-07-001 and NGC 1210 show complex tidal tails\nand debris structures. The UV morphology of both galaxies appears so different\nfrom the optical one that the early-type classification may not apply.

The natural square-root Hamiltonian of the free\nrelativistic solitary particle is iterated to obtain the Klein-Gordon equation\nand linearized to obtain the Dirac Hamiltonian, steps that have calculational\nbut not physical motivation, and which generate the above-mentioned problematic\nnegative-energy solutions as extraneous artifacts.

That is achieved by use of Lorentz-covariant solitary-particle four\nmomentum techniques together with the assumption that well-known\nnonrelativistic dynamics applies in the particle's rest frame.\nLorentz-invariant solitary particle actions, whose formal Hamiltonization is an\nequivalent alternative approach, are as well explicitly displayed.

This is due to a significant contribution of the spin-torque\nterm arisen from the alternative definition of spin current which strongly\naffects the magnitude and the sign of the dynamic spin current.

The properties of the M31 clusters are comparable to those of clusters\nof similar age in the Magellanic Clouds. Simulated star clusters are used to\nderive a conversion from statistical measures of cluster size to half-light\nradius so that the extragalactic clusters can be compared to young massive\nclusters in the Milky Way.

The young M31 clusters are expected to dissolve\nwithin a few Gyr and will not survive to become old, globular clusters.\nHowever, they do appear to follow the same fundamental plane relations as old\nclusters; if confirmed with velocity dispersion measurements, this would be a\nstrong indication that the star cluster fundamental plane reflects universal\ncluster formation conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2009 17:36:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-07"}

A total of\n77 consecutive transit light curves of CoRoT-2 were observed with a high\ntemporal resolution of 32 s, corresponding to an uninterrupted period of 134\ndays. By analyzing small intensity variations in the transit light curves, it\nwas possible to detect and characterize spots at fixed positions (latitude and\nlongitude) on the surface of the star. The model used simulates planetary\ntransits and enables the inclusion of spots on the stellar surface with\ndifferent sizes, intensities (i.e. temperatures), and positions. Fitting the\ndata by this model, it is possible to infer the spots physical characteristics.\nThe fits were either in spot longitude and radius, with a fixed intensity, or\nin spots longitude and intensity, for spots of constant size. Before the\nmodeling of the spots were performed, the planetary radius relative to the star\nradius was estimated by fitting the deepest transit to minimize the effect of\nspots. A slightly larger (3%) radius, 0.172 Rstar, resulted instead of the\npreviously reported 0.1667 Rstar . The fitting of the transits yield spots, or\nspot groups, with sizes of ranging from 0.2 to 0.7 planet radius, Rp, with a\nmean of (0.41 +/- 0.13) Rp (~100,000 km), resulting in a stellar area covered\nby spots within the transit latitudes of 10-20%. The intensity varied from 0.4\nto 0.9 of the disk center intensity, Ic, with a mean of (0.60 +/- 0.19) Ic,\nwhich can be converted to temperature by assuming an effective temperature of\n5625 K for the stellar photosphere, the spots temperature ranges mainly from\n3600 to 5000 K. The results from the spot modeling are in agreement with those\nfound for magnetic activity analysis from out of transit data of the same star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2009 17:57:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Analysis of interacting string with proper\ninclusion of the stringy boundary conditions led to the noncommutative nature\nof the string coordinates.

In contrast to the other planets,\nits measured brightness temperature of 2170+-55 K is significantly higher than\nits maximum hemisphere-averaged effective day-side temperature.

We study the signal photon flux, background photon flux and the requisite\nminimal accumulation time of the signal in the coupling system. Unlike pure\ninverse Gertsenshtein effect (G-effect) caused by the HFGWs in the GHz band,\nthe the electromagnetic (EM) detecting scheme (EDS) proposed by China and the\nUS HFGW groups is based on the composite effect of the synchro-resonance effect\nand the inverse G-effect.

Based on these calculations, we also\nsimulate the time evolution of thermal emission from the shock-heated dust in\nthe SNR and compare the results with the observations of Cas A SNR. We find\nthat the total mass of dust formed in the SN IIb is as large as 0.167 M_sun but\nthe average radius of dust is smaller than 0.01 mum and is significantly\ndifferent from those in SNe II-P with the massive H-envelope. In the explosion\nwith the small-mass H-envelope, the expanding He core undergoes little\ndeceleration, so that the gas density in the He core is too low for large-sized\ngrains to form. In addition, the low-mass H-envelope of the SN IIb leads to the\nearly arrival of the reverse shock at the dust-forming region. If the CSM is\nmore or less spherical, therefore, the newly formed grains would be completely\ndestroyed in the relatively dense shocked gas for the CSM density of n_H > 0.1\ncm^{-3}. However, the actual CSM is likely to be non-spherical, so that a part\nof grains could be ejected into the ISM without being shocked. We demonstrate\nthat the time evolution of the SED by thermal dust emission is sensitive to the\nambient gas density and structure that affects the passage of the reverse shock\ninto the ejecta. Thus, the SED evolution well reflects the evolution of dust\nthrough erosion by sputtering and stochastic heating. For Cas A, we consider\nthe CSM produced by the steady mass loss of ~8x10^{-5} M_sun/yr during the\nsupergiant phase. Then we find the infrared SED of Cas A is reasonably\nreproduced by thermal emission from the newly formed dust of 0.08 M_sun, which\nconsists of 0.008 M_sun shocked warm dust and 0.072 M_sun unshocked cold dust.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2009 08:02:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2010 02:44:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

In this paper, we investigate spectral entanglement\nbetween the two output modes of a periodically poled waveguide. With the intent\nof generating heralded 1- and 2-photon Fock states, we expand the output state\nof the PDC to second order in photon number. We explore the effects of spectral\nfiltering and inefficient detection, of the heralding mode, on the count rate,\ng(2) and purity of the heralded state, as well as the fidelity between the\nresulting state and an ideal Fock state. We find that filtering can decrease\nspectral correlations, however, at the expense of the count rate and increased\nphoton-number mixedness in the heralded output state. As a physical example, we\nmodel a type II PP-KTP waveguide pumped by lasers at wavelengths of 400 nm, 788\nnm and 1930 nm.

Using a dark matter halo with properties similar to the\nones for the Milky Way's stellar halo, we perform a comparison of different\nmethods of distributing energy related to feedback processes to the surrounding\ngas. A most promising standard model is applied to halos spanning a range of\nmasses in order to compare the results to disk galaxy scaling relations. With\nfew exceptions we find little or no angular momentum deficiency for our\ngalaxies and a good agreement with the angular momentum-size relation. Our\ngalaxies are in good agreement with the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation and the\nslope of the photometric Tully-Fisher relation is reproduced. We find a\nzero-point offset of 0.7 to 1 magnitudes, depending on the employed IMF. We\nalso study our standard feedback model in combination with additional physical\nprocesses like a UV background, kinetic feedback, a delayed energy deposition\nas expected for type Ia supernovae, mass return and metal-dependent cooling.\nOnly a combination of effects yields a real improvement of the resulting galaxy\nby reducing the bulge, while including metal-dependent cooling increases the\nbulge again. We find that in general the stellar mass fraction of our galaxies\nis too high. In an ad-hoc experiment we show that an removal of the bulge could\nreconcile this. However, the fit of the Tully-Fisher relation can only be\nimproved by delaying the star formation, but not suppressing it completely. Our\nmodels do not seem to be efficient enough to achieve either effect. We conclude\nthat disk formation is a complex, highly interconnected problem and we expect a\nsolution to come from a combination of small effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2009 10:09:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-24"}

The\nchoice was to measure at a given pressure P where the system will go, by\nlowering the temperature, successively from paramagnetic (PM) to HO and then to\nantiferromagnetic phase (AF). Furthermore, in order to verify the selection of\nthe pressure, a macroscopic detection of the phase transitions was also\nachieved in situ via its thermal expansion response detected by a strain gauge\nglued on the crystal. Just above P_x = 0.5 GPa, where the ground state switches\nfrom HO to AF, the Q_0 = (1, 0, 0) excitation disappears while the excitation\nat the incommensurate wavevector Q_1 = (1.4, 0, 0) remains. Thus, the Q_0 = (1,\n0, 0) excitation is intrinsic only in the HO phase. This result is reinforced\nby studies where now pressure and magnetic field $H$ can be used as tuning\nvariable. Above P_x, the AF phase at low temperature is destroyed by a magnetic\nfield larger than H_AF (collapse of the AF Q_0 = (1, 0, 0) Bragg reflection).\nThe field reentrance of the HO phase is demonstrated by the reappearance of its\ncharacteristic Q_0 = (1, 0, 0) excitation. The recovery of a PM phase will only\nbe achieved far above H_AF at H_M approx 35 T. To determine the P-H-T phase\ndiagram of URu2Si2, macroscopic measurements of the thermal expansion were\nrealized with a strain gauge. The reentrant magnetic field increases strongly\nwith pressure. Finally, to investigate the interplay between superconductivity\n(SC) and spin dynamics, new inelastic neutron scattering experiments are\nreported down to 0.4 K, far below the superconducting critical temperature T_SC\napprox 1.3 K as measured on our crystal by diamagnetic shielding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2009 12:04:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Here, elaborating on this point, we show that the\ndissipative character leading to a non-equilibrium spacetime thermodynamics is\nactually related -- both in GR as well as in $f(R)$ gravity -- to non-local\nheat fluxes associated with the purely gravitational/internal degrees of\nfreedom of the theory. In particular, in the case of GR we show that the\ninternal entropy production term is identical to the so called tidal heating\nterm of Hartle-Hawking. Similarly, for the case of $f(R)$ gravity, we show that\ndissipative effects can be associated with the generalization of this term plus\na scalar contribution whose presence is clearly justified within the\nscalar-tensor representation of the theory. Finally, we show that the allowed\ngravitational degrees of freedom can be fixed by the kinematics of the local\nspacetime causal structure, through the specific Equivalence Principle\nformulation. In this sense, the thermodynamical description seems to go beyond\nEinstein's theory as an intrinsic property of gravitation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2009 12:46:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-06"}

Both models are derived from the\nthree-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation (3D GPE). To produce \"model 1\"\n(which was derived in recent works), the 3D GPE is first reduced to the 1D\ncontinual NPSE, which is subsequently discretized. \"Model 2\", that was not\nconsidered before, is derived by first discretizing the 3D GPE, which is\nfollowed by the reduction of the dimension. The two models seem very different;\nin particular, model 1 is represented by a single discrete equation for the 1D\nwave function, while model 2 includes an additional equation for the transverse\nwidth. Nevertheless, numerical analyses show similar behaviors of fundamental\nunstaggered solitons in both systems, as concerns their existence region and\nstability limits. Both models admit the collapse of the localized modes,\nreproducing the fundamental property of the self-attractive BEC confined in\ntight traps. Thus, we conclude that the fundamental properties of discrete\nsolitons predicted for the strongly trapped self-attracting BEC are reliable,\nas the two distinct models produce them in a nearly identical form. However, a\ndifference between the models is found too, as strongly pinned (very narrow)\ndiscrete solitons, which were previously found in model 1, are not generated by\nmodel 2 -- in fact, in agreement with the continual 1D NPSE, which does not\nhave such solutions either. In that respect, the newly derived model provides\nfor a more accurate approximation for the trapped BEC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2009 12:57:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-24"}

In a few cases, a pinwheel-like structure of the dusty envelope\nhas been detected. Therefore, it has been suggested that dust formation in all\ndusty WR stars might be linked to colliding winds in a binary system. We probed\nthe innermost region of the circumstellar dust shell of the deeply embedded WR\nstar WR 118. We carried out spectro-interferometric observations using the\nAMBER instrument of ESO's Very Large Telescope Interferometer in low-spectral\nresolution mode (R = 35). The K-band observations were obtained with three 1.8\nm telescopes spanning projected baselines between 9.2 and 40.1 m. At high\nspatial frequencies, the AMBER visibilities exhibit a prominent lobe,\nindicating that the envelope contains one or several zones with a large local\nintensity gradient. The strong closure phase signal clearly shows that the\ncircumstellar envelope of WR 118 can only be described by an asymmetric\nintensity distribution. We show that a pinwheel nebula seen at low inclination\nis consistent with the AMBER data. Its size was determined to be 13.9+-1.1 mas.\nWR 118 possibly harbors a pinwheel nebula, which suggests a binary nature of\nthe system.

Our analysis shows that late-R stars are carbon stars with identical\nchemical and observational characteristics than the normal (N-type) AGB carbon\nstars. We confirm the results of the sole previous abundance analysis of\nearly-R stars by Dominy (1984, ApJS, 55, 27), namely: they are carbon stars\nwith near solar metallicity showing enhanced nitrogen, low carbon isotopic\nratios and no s-element enhancements. In addition, we have found that early-R\nstars have Li abundances larger than expected for post RGB tip giants. We also\nfind that a significant number (aprox. 40 %) of the early-R stars in our sample\nare wrongly classified, being probably classical CH stars and normal K giants.\nIn consequence, we suggest that the number of true R stars is considerably\nlower than previously believed.

It\nis a long-standing open question whether determining these numbers for a graph\n$G$ on $n$ vertices admits exact algorithms running in time less than the\ntrivial $\\Omega(2^n)$ enumeration barrier. We solve these open problems by\ndevising parameterized algorithms for the dual of the natural parameterizations\nof the problems with running times faster than $O^*(4^{k})$. For example, we\npresent an algorithm running in time $O^*(3.069^{k})$ for determining whether\n$IR(G)$ is at least $n-k$. Although the corresponding problem has been known to\nbe in FPT by kernelization techniques, this paper offers the first\nparameterized algorithms with an exponential dependency on the parameter in the\nrunning time.

It is thought that the primordial gas is largely removed at ages of ~10\nMyr, but it is difficult to discern the true gas densities from gas\nobservations. This suggests using observations of dust: it has been argued that\ngas, if present with higher densities, would lead to flatter radial profiles of\nthe dust density and surface brightness than those actually observed. However,\nhere we show that these profiles are surprisingly insensitive to variation of\nthe parameters of a central star, location of the dust-producing planetesimal\nbelt, dustiness of the disk and - most importantly - the parameters of the\nambient gas. This result holds for a wide range of gas densities (three orders\nof magnitude), for different radial distributions of the gas temperature, and\ndifferent gas compositions. The brightness profile slopes of -3...-4 we find\nare the same that were theoretically found for gas-free debris disks, and they\nare the same as actually retrieved from observations of many debris disks. Our\nspecific results for three young (10-30 Myr old), spatially resolved, edge-on\ndebris disks (beta Pic, HD 32297, and AU Mic) show that the observed radial\nprofiles of the surface brightness do not pose any stringent constraints on the\ngas component of the disk. We cannot exclude that outer parts of the systems\nmay have retained substantial amounts of primordial gas which is not evident in\nthe gas observations (e.g. as much as 50 Earth masses for beta Pic). However,\nthe possibility that gas, most likely secondary, is only present in little to\nmoderate amounts, as deduced from gas detections (e.g. ~0.05 Earth masses in\nthe beta Pic disk), remains open, too.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2009 15:40:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2009 16:05:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

We present the results of a\nsuite of simulations with a resolution of 512-cubed of turbulent decay in\nmolecular clouds incorporating a simplified form of both ambipolar diffusion\nand the Hall effect simultaneously. The initial velocity field in the\nturbulence is varied from being super-Alfv\\'enic and hypersonic, through to\ntrans-Alfv\\'enic but still supersonic.\n  We find that ambipolar diffusion increases the rate of decay of the\nturbulence increasing the decay from $t^{-1.25}$ to $t^{-1.4}$. The Hall effect\nhas virtually no impact in this regard. The power spectra of density, velocity\nand the magnetic field are all affected by the non-ideal terms, being steepened\nsignificantly when compared with ideal MHD turbulence with exponents. The\ndensity power spectra components change from about 1.4 to about 2.1 for the\nideal and non-ideal simulations respectively, and power spectra of the other\nvariables all show similar modifications when non-ideal effects are considered.\nAgain, the dominant source of these changes is ambipolar diffusion rather than\nthe Hall effect. There is also a decoupling between the velocity field and the\nmagnetic field at short length scales. The Hall effect leads to enhanced\nmagnetic reconnection, and hence less power, at short length scales. The\ndependence of the velocity dispersion on the characteristic length scale is\nstudied and found not to be power-law in nature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2009 15:12:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}
