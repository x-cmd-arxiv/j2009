These widely separated giants have been interpreted as\nsigns of planet formation driven by gravitational instability, but the\nviability of this mechanism is not clear cut. In this paper, we first discuss\nthe local requirements for fragmentation and the initial fragment mass scales.\nWe then consider whether the fragment's subsequent growth can be terminated\nwithin the planetary mass regime. Finally, we place disks in the larger context\nof star formation and disk evolution models. We find that in order for\ngravitational instability to produce planets, disks must be atypically cold in\norder to reduce the initial fragment mass. In addition, fragmentation must\noccur during a narrow window of disk evolution, after infall has mostly ceased,\nbut while the disk is still sufficiently massive to undergo gravitational\ninstability. Under more typical conditions, disk-born objects will likely grow\nwell above the deuterium burning planetary mass limit. We conclude that if\nplanets are formed by gravitational instability, they must be the low mass tail\nof the distribution of disk-born companions. To validate this theory, on-going\ndirect imaging surveys must find a greater abundance of brown dwarf and M-star\ncompanions to A-stars. Their absence would suggest planet formation by a\ndifferent mechanism such as core accretion, which is consistent with the debris\ndisks detected in these systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2009 17:52:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2010 21:48:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

We address both\nquestions, by reducing two well-studied models of tile assembly to models of\ndistributed shared memory (DSM), in order to obtain results from the memory\nconsistency systems induced by tile assembly systems when simulated in the DSM\nsetting. The Abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM) can be simulated by a DSM\nsystem that obeys causal consistency, and the locally deterministic tile\nassembly systems in the aTAM correspond exactly to the concurrent-write free\nprograms that simulate tile assembly in such a model. Thus, the detection of\nthe failure of local determinism (which had formerly been an open problem)\nreduces to the detection of data races in simulating programs. Further, the\nKinetic Tile Assembly Model can be simulated by a DSM system that obeys GWO, a\nmemory consistency condition defined by Steinke and Nutt. (To our knowledge,\nthis is the first natural example of a DSM system that obeys GWO, but no\nstronger consistency condition.) We combine these results with the observation\nthat self-assembly algorithms are local algorithms, and there exists a fast\nconversion of deterministic local algorithms into deterministic\nself-stabilizing algorithms. This provides an \"immediate\" generalization of a\ntheorem by Soloveichik et al. about the existence of tile assembly systems that\nsimultaneously perform two forms of self-stabilization: proofreading and\nself-healing. Our reductions and proof techniques can be extended to the\nprogramming of self-assembling agents in a variety of media, not just DNA\ntiles, and not just two-dimensional surfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2009 19:45:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-16"}

An s-plex is a graph in which every\nvertex is nonadjacent to at most s-1 other vertices; a clique is an 1-plex. In\ncontrast to Cluster Vertex Deletion, s-Plex Cluster Vertex Deletion allows to\nbalance the number of vertex deletions against the sizes and the density of the\nresulting clusters, which are s-plexes instead of cliques. The focus of this\nwork is the development of provably efficient and effective data reduction\nrules for s-Plex Cluster Vertex Deletion.

A similar problem, s-Plex\nEditing, where the task is the insertion or the deletion of edges so that the\nconnected components of a graph become s-plexes, has also been studied in terms\nof fixed-parameter algorithmics. Using the number of allowed graph\nmodifications as parameter, we expect typical parameter values for s-Plex\nCluster Vertex Deletion to be significantly lower than for s-Plex Editing,\nbecause one vertex deletion can lead to a high number of edge deletions.

By employing a\nsimple model for the self-energy Sigma of a MH state, we show that the\nfinite-size-scaling approach of the type utilised by KP is not reliable for the\nsystem sizes considered by KP. On the basis of the equivalence of the model\nunder consideration (at half-filling and for t'/t << 1) and the XXZ spin-chain\nHamiltonian for SU(2) spins, we further show that for V > V_c(t,t') the system\nunder consideration has a charge-density-wave (CDW) ground state (GS) in the\nthermodynamic limit, corresponding to a doubling of the unit cell in comparison\nwith that specific to the underlying lattice. Although this GS is also\ninsulating, its spectral gap is due to the broken translational symmetry of the\nGS; it is not a correlation-induced MH gap. The LT is therefore a priori valid\nfor this GS. This fact establishes that the conclusion by KP is indeed\nerroneous. Finally, we present a heuristic argument due to Volovik that sheds\nlight on the mechanism underlying the robustness of the LT.

Perhaps surprisingly, it is controversial\nhow much a protein's functional importance affects its rate of evolution. In\nmost studies, functional importance has been measured on the coarse scale of\nprotein knock-outs, while evolutionary rate has been measured on the fine scale\nof amino acid substitutions. Here we introduce dynamical influence, a finer\nmeasure of protein functional importance. To measure dynamical influence, we\nfirst use detailed biochemical models of particular reaction networks to\nmeasure the influence of each reaction rate constant on network dynamics. We\nthen define the dynamical influence of a protein to be the average influence of\nthe rate constants for all reactions it is involved in.\n  Using models of a dozen biochemical systems and sequence data from\nvertebrates, we show that dynamical influence and evolutionary rate are\nnegatively correlated; proteins with greater dynamical influence evolve more\nslowly. We also show that proteins with greater dynamical influence are not\nmore likely to be essential. This suggests that there are many cellular\nreactions whose presence is essential for life, but whose quantitative rate is\nrelatively unimportant to fitness. We also provide evidence that the effect of\ndynamical influence on evolutionary rate is independent of protein expression\nlevel, expression specificity, gene compactness, and reaction degree.

However, the lack of a consistent real-space picture of\nphonon-mediated pairing suggests that the pairing interpretation may be\nincomplete or even misleading. Alternatively, the present picture refers back\nto an old proposal by Frohlich, whereby superconductivity is based on an\ninduced electron charge density wave coupled to a one-dimensional static\nlattice distortion. In the new picture, dynamic three-dimensional\ncharge-density waves couple to coherent standing-wave phonons, giving rise to a\nmobile superconducting ground state that does not pin on crystalline defects.\nLong-range order in the ground state is associated with localized electron\norbitals in a correlated two-phase field, which provides for flux quantization\nin units of h/2e on the macroscopic scale larger than the coherence length,\nwithout the need for a macroscopic pair wave function. While much of the\nformalism for this picture may carry over from conventional BCS theory, this\npicture makes distinct predictions for observable structures on the microscopic\nand mesoscopic scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2009 00:42:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-17"}

An important problem with LiNGAM\nis that the results are affected by the random sampling of the data as with any\nstatistical method. Thus, some analysis of the statistical reliability or\nconfidence level should be conducted. A common method to evaluate a confidence\nlevel is a bootstrap method. However, a confidence level computed by ordinary\nbootstrap method is known to be biased as a probability-value ($p$-value) of\nhypothesis testing.

Recently, these algorithms have gained renewed\ninterest due to their generality, good convergence properties, and possible\nbiological relevance. In this paper, we introduce an online temporal difference\nbased actor-critic algorithm which is proved to converge to a neighborhood of a\nlocal maximum of the average reward. Linear function approximation is used by\nthe critic in order estimate the value function, and the temporal difference\nsignal, which is passed from the critic to the actor. The main distinguishing\nfeature of the present convergence proof is that both the actor and the critic\noperate on a similar time scale, while in most current convergence proofs they\nare required to have very different time scales in order to converge. Moreover,\nthe same temporal difference signal is used to update the parameters of both\nthe actor and the critic. A limitation of the proposed approach, compared to\nresults available for two time scale convergence, is that convergence is\nguaranteed only to a neighborhood of an optimal value, rather to an optimal\nvalue itself. The single time scale and identical temporal difference signal\nused by the actor and the critic, may provide a step towards constructing more\nbiologically realistic models of reinforcement learning in the brain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2009 07:08:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-17"}

Based on the gravitational wells set by the dark matter\nhalos, the SM straightforwardly expresses the equilibrium of the IntraCluster\nPlasma (ICP) modulated by the entropy deposited at the boundary by standing\nshocks from gravitational accretion, and injected at the center by outgoing\nblastwaves from mergers or from outbursts of Active Galactic Nuclei. The\ncluster set analyzed here highlights not only how simply the SM represents the\nmain dichotomy Cool vs. Non Cool Core clusters in terms of a few ICP parameters\ngoverning the radial entropy run, but also how accurately it fits even complex\nbrightness and temperature profiles. For Cool Core clusters like A2199 and\nA2597, the SM with a low level of central entropy straightforwardly yields the\ncharacteristic peaked profile of the temperature marked by a decline toward the\ncenter, without requiring currently strong radiative cooling and high mass\ndeposition rates. Non Cool Core clusters like A1656 require instead a central\nentropy floor of a substantial level, and some like A2256 and even more A644\nfeature structured temperature profiles that also call for a definite floor\nextension; in such conditions the SM accurately fits the observations, and\nsuggests that in these clusters the ICP has been just remolded by a merger\nevent, in the way of a remnant cool core. The SM also predicts that dark matter\nhalos with high concentration should correlate with flatter entropy profiles\nand steeper brightness in the outskirts; this is indeed the case with A1689.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2009 08:12:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2009 14:51:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

The X-ray data are very well\ndescribed by a simple model comprising a power law X-ray continuum plus its\nreflection off the accretion disc. If the inner disc radius we measure (<=3.8\ngravitational radii) is identified with the innermost stable circular orbit of\nthe black hole spacetime, we infer that the black hole powering RBS 1124 is\nrotating rapidly with spin a>= 0.6. The soft excess contribution in the 0.5-2\nkeV band is ~15%, about half than that typically observed in unobscured Seyfert\n1 galaxies and quasars, in line with the low disc reflection fraction we\nmeasure (R_disc ~0.4). The low reflection fraction cannot be driven by disc\ntruncation which is at odds not only with the small inner disc radius we infer\nbut, most importantly, with the radiatively efficient nature of the source\n(L_Bol / L_Edd ~1). A plausible explanation is that the X-ray corona is the\nbase of a failed jet (RBS 1124 being radio-quiet) and actually outflowing at\nmildly relativistic speeds. Aberration reduces the irradiation of the disc,\nthus forcing a lower than standard reflection fraction, and halves the inferred\nsource intrinsic luminosity, reducing the derived Eddington ratio from ~1to\n~0.5.

Similarly, the QPO frequency varies with the source count rate (S).\nHence, the significance of a QPO, scaling as S x Rs^2/W^(1/2) will also depend\non frequency. In addition, the significance also scales up with the square root\nof the integration time of the Fourier power density spectrum (T).\nConsequently, depending on the way data are considered, kHz QPOs may be\ndetected only over a limited range of their frequency spans or detected\npredominantly at some frequencies, leading potentially to biases in the\nobserved distributions of frequencies or frequency ratios. Although subject of\nmuch controversy, an observed clustering of QPO frequency ratios around 3/2 in\nSco X-1, also seen in other sources, has been previously used as an argument\nsupporting resonance based models of neutron star QPOs. In this paper, we\nmeasure how the statistical significance of both kHz QPOs vary with frequency\nfor three prototype neutron star kHz QPO sources, namely 4U1636-536, 4U0614+091\nand Sco X-1. As the significance of QPO detection depends on frequency, we show\nthat in sensitivity-limited observations (as in the case of the RXTE/PCA), a\nsimultaneous detection of both the lower and upper kHz QPOs can only be\nachieved over limited frequency ranges. As a result, even a uniform\ndistribution of QPO frequencies will lead to peaks (in particular around 3/2)\nin the histogram of frequency ratios. This implies that the observed clustering\nof ratios does not provide any evidence for intrinsically preferred frequency\nratios, thus weakening the case for a resonance mechanism at the origin of\nneutron star kHz QPOs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2009 12:03:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Full space\nmotions for a sub-sample of 16920 stars, exploring a local volume within 4 kpc\nof the Sun, are used to derive velocity ellipsoids for the inner- and\nouter-halo components of the Galaxy, as well as for the canonical thick-disk\nand proposed metal-weak thick-disk populations. We first examine the question\nof whether the data require the presence of at least a two-component halo in\norder to account for the rotational behavior of likely halo stars in the local\nvolume, and whether more than two components are needed. We also address the\nquestion of whether the proposed metal-weak thick disk is kinematically and\nchemically distinct from the canonical thick disk. In addition, we consider the\nfractions of each component required to understand the nature of the observed\nkinematic behavior of the stellar populations of the Galaxy as a function of\ndistance from the plane. Scale lengths and scale heights for the thick-disk and\nmetal-weak thick-disk components are determined. Spatial density profiles for\nthe inner- and outer-halo populations are inferred from a Jeans Theorem\nanalysis. The full set of calibration stars (including those outside the local\nvolume) is used to test for the expected changes in the observed stellar\nmetallicity distribution function with distance above the Galactic plane\nin-situ, due to the changing contributions from the underlying stellar\npopulations.

From the\ndeep photometry, we construct color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) and measure the\nstar formation histories (SFHs) for stars contained in HI holes from two\nindependent holes catalogs, as well as select control fields, i.e., similar\nsized regions that span a range of HI column densities. Converting the recent\nSFHs into stellar feedback energies, we find that enough energy has been\ngenerated to have created all holes. However, the required energy is not always\nproduced over a time scale that is less than the estimated kinematic age of the\nhole. The combination of the CMDs, recent SFHs, and locations of young stars\nshows that the stellar populations inside HI holes are not coherent,\nsingle-aged, stellar clusters, as previously suggested, but rather multi-age\npopulations distributed across each hole. From a comparison of the modeled and\nobserved integrated magnitudes, and the locations and energetics of stars\ninside of HI holes, we propose a potential new model: a viable mechanism for\ncreating the observed HI holes in Ho II is stellar feedback from multiple\ngenerations of SF spread out over tens or hundreds of Myr, and thus, the\nconcept of an age for an HI hole is intrinsically ambiguous. We further find\nthat \\halpha and 24 micron emission, tracers of the most recent star formation,\ndo not correlate well with the positions of the HI holes. However, UV emission,\nwhich traces star formation over roughly the last 100 Myr, shows a much better\ncorrelation with the locations of the HI holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2009 14:28:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

Optical observations of IC 2497 revealed the existence of a\ngiant emission nebula \"Hanny's Voorwerp\" in the proximity of the galaxy.\nEarlier short-track 18 cm observations with e-VLBI at 18 cm, detected a compact\nradio component (C1) at the centre of IC 2497. The brightness temperature of C1\nwas measured to be greater than 4E5 K. Deeper, long-track e-VLBI observations\npresented here, re-confirm the existence of C1 but also reveal the existence of\na second compact component (C2) located about 230 milliarcseconds to the\nNorth-East of C1. The brightness temperature of C2 is measured to be greater\nthan 1.4E5 K, suggesting that both components may be related to AGN activity\n(e.g. a radio core and jet hotspot). Lower resolution 18cm MERLIN observations\nshow both components. C1 is shown to be compact with a slight elongation along\nthe direction of Hanny's Voorwerp, and C2 shows a lot of extended emission in\nan almost perpendicular direction to the direction of the Voorwerp. Our results\ncontinue to support the hypothesis that IC 2497 contains an Active Galactic\nNucleus (AGN), and that a jet associated with this AGN clears a path that\npermits ionising radiation from the AGN to directly illuminate the emission\nnebula.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2009 15:14:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-17"}

X-ray surveys in the 2-10\nkeV band will miss the most heavily-obscured AGN in which the absorbing column\ndensity exceeds $\\sim10^{24}$cm$^{-2}$ (the Compton-thick AGN). It is therefore\nvital to know the fraction of AGN that are missed in such X-rays surveys and to\ndetermine if these AGN represent some distinct population in terms of the\nfundamental properties of AGN and/or their host galaxies. In this paper we\npresent the analysis of \\textit{XMM-Newton} X-ray data for a complete sample of\n17 low-redshift Type 2 Seyfert galaxies chosen from the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey based solely on the high observed flux of the [OIII]$\\lambda$5007\nemission-line. This line is formed in the Narrow Line Region hundreds of\nparsecs away from the central engine. Thus, unlike the X-ray emission, it is\nnot affected by obscuration due to the torus surrounding the black hole. It\ntherefore provides a useful isotropic indicator of the AGN luminosity. As\nadditional indicators of the intrinsic AGN luminosity, we use the Spitzer Space\nTelescope to measure the luminosities of the mid-infrared continuum and the\n[OIV]25.89$\\mu$m narrow emission-line. We then use the ratio of the 2-10 keV\nX-ray luminosity to the [OIII], [OIV], and mid-infrared luminosities to assess\nthe amount of X-ray obscuration and to distinguish between Compton-thick and\nCompton-thin objects. We find that the majority of the sources suffer\nsignificant amounts of obscuration: the observed 2-10 keV emission is depressed\nby more than an order-of-magnitude in 11 of the 17 cases (as expected for\nCompton-thick sources).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2009 15:31:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

I study QED and QCD bound states at lowest\norder in hbar, which are analogous to Born amplitudes. The absence of loops\nallows the use of retarded boundary conditions where particles only propagate\nforward in time, making a hamiltonian approach feasible. The instantaneous A^0\nfield is determined by the equations of motion separately for each Fock\ncomponent of the bound state. The field equations are compatible with a linear\nA^0 potential as a homogeneous, non-perturbative solution. Stationarity of the\naction determines the direction of the ensuing constant electric field in each\nFock state. Applying this approach to relativistic qqbar and qqq states in QCD\nresults in a bound state equation which provides a reasonable description of\nthe spectrum, including linear Regge trajectories.
