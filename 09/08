The\nprinciple bounds the uncertainties about the outcomes of two incompatible\nmeasurements, such as position and momentum, on a particle.

However, if the particle is prepared\nentangled with a quantum memory, a device which is likely to soon be available,\nit is possible to predict the outcomes for both measurement choices precisely.\nIn this work we strengthen the uncertainty principle to incorporate this case,\nproviding a lower bound on the uncertainties which depends on the amount of\nentanglement between the particle and the quantum memory.

Specifically, a node transmits a\npacket when its timer expires, and the timer value is a monotone non-increasing\nfunction of its local suitability metric. The best node is selected\nsuccessfully if no other node's timer expires within a 'vulnerability' window\nafter its timer expiry, and so long as the sink can hear the available nodes.\nIn this paper, we show that the optimal metric-to-timer mapping that (i)\nmaximizes the probability of success or (ii) minimizes the average selection\ntime subject to a minimum constraint on the probability of success, maps the\nmetric into a set of discrete timer values. We specify, in closed-form, the\noptimal scheme as a function of the maximum selection duration, the\nvulnerability window, and the number of nodes. An asymptotic characterization\nof the optimal scheme turns out to be elegant and insightful. For any\nprobability distribution function of the metric, the optimal scheme is\nscalable, distributed, and performs much better than the popular inverse metric\ntimer mapping. It even compares favorably with splitting-based selection, when\nthe latter's feedback overhead is accounted for.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2009 16:13:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

Using approximate\nmodels for a rich cluster (A1795), a poor cluster (2A 0336+096) and a group\n(NGC 5044), we show that mass-carrying jets with intermediate mechanical\nefficiencies ($\\sim10^{-3}$) can reduce for many Gyr the global cooling rate to\nor below the low values implied by X-spectra, while maintaining $T$ and $\\rho$\nprofiles similar to those observed, at least in clusters.

A core of initial radius 1-1.5 pc\nevolves to a size of approximately 0.5 pc after 10 Gyr, roughly the size of the\nobserved core. The absence of a Bahcall-Wolf cusp is naturally explained in\nthese models, without the need for fine-tuning or implausible initial\nconditions. In the absence of a cusp, the time for a 10-solar-mass black hole\nto spiral in to the Galactic center from an initial distance of 5 pc can be\nmuch greater than 10 Gyr.

The use of clustering allows us to determine what\nfraction of the red sequence is made up of central galaxies and satellite\ngalaxies. At all redshifts, including z=0, the data are consistent with ~60% of\nsatellite galaxies being red or quenched, implying that ~1/3 of the red\nsequence is comprised of satellite galaxies. More than three-fourths of red\nsatellite galaxies were moved to the red sequence after they were accreted onto\na larger halo.

The large errors on the\nfourth sample inhibit any conclusions. Theoretical models in which star\nformation is quenched above a critical halo mass are excluded by these data. A\nscenario in which mergers create red central galaxies imparts a weaker\ncorrelation between halo mass and central galaxy color, but even the merger\nscenario creates tension with red galaxy clustering at redshifts above 0.5.\nThese results suggest that the mechanism by which central galaxies become red\nevolves from z=0.5 to z=0.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2009 20:04:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

We model\ninternal shocks as being caused by collisions of shells of plasma with the same\nenergy flux and a non-zero relative velocity. The contact surface, where the\ninteraction between the shells takes place, can break up either into two\noppositely moving shocks (in the frame where the contact surface is at rest),\nor into a reverse shock and a forward rarefaction. We find that for moderately\nmagnetized shocks (magnetization $\\sigma\\simeq 0.1$), the dynamic efficiency in\na single two-shell interaction can be as large as 40%. Thus, the dynamic\nefficiency of moderately magnetized shocks is larger than in the corresponding\nunmagnetized two-shell interaction. If the slower shell propagates with a\nsufficiently large velocity, the efficiency is only weakly dependent on its\nLorentz factor. Consequently, the dynamic efficiency of shell interactions in\nthe magnetized flow of blazars and gamma-ray bursts is effectively the same.\nThese results are quantitatively rather independent on the equation of state of\nthe plasma. The radiative efficiency of the process is expected to be a\nfraction $f_r<1$ of the estimated dynamic one, the exact value of $f_r$\ndepending on the particularities of the emission processes which radiate away\nthe thermal or magnetic energy of the shocked states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2009 20:05:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The\ntotal HI flux measurement obtained with the Nancay Radio Telescope and the\nphotometric results imply that the galaxy ratio M(HI)/L_B ~3.0, is among the\ntop known in the Local Volume.

The mechanisms are the breakout of the\nthermonuclear burning front as it reaches the surface of the white dwarf and\nthe interaction of the rapidly expanding envelope with an accretion disk. Based\non the delayed-detonation scenario and detailed radiation-hydro calculation\nwhich include nuclear networks, we find that both mechanisms produce ~1 second\nflashes of high energy radiation with peak luminosities of 10^48 to 10^50\nerg/sec with fast rises and exponential declines. The X- and gamma-ray\nvisibility of a SN-Ia will depend strongly on self absorption within the\nprogenitor system, specifically on the properties of the accretion disk and its\norientation towards the observer. Such X-ray and gamma-ray flashes could be\ndetected as triggered events by Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) detectors on satellites,\nwith events in current GRB catalogs. We have searched through the GRB catalogs\n(for the BATSE, HETE, and Swift experiments) for GRBs that occur at the\nextrapolated time of explosion and in the correct direction for known Type Ia\nsupernovae with radial velocity of less than 3,000 km/s. For BATSE about\n12.9+-3.6 nearby SNe Ia should have been detected, but only 0.8+-0.7\nnon-coincidental matches have been found. With the HETE and Swift satellites,\nwe expect to see 5.6+-1.3 SN-Ia flashes from known nearby SNe Ia but, yet, no\nSN-Ia flashes were detected. These place observational limits that the\nbolometric peak luminosity of SN-Ia Flashes must be less ~10^46 erg/s. We\nattribute the difference between theory and observational limits to the\nabsorption of the X- and gamma-rays by the accretion disk of large scale height\nor common envelope that would be smothering the white dwarf.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2009 23:19:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The metal abundance in the central cool region is found to be higher than\nthe surrounding region, which was not resolved in the former studies. We\nconfirm that the line-of-sight velocities of the intracluster medium in the\nobserved region are consistent with those of the member galaxies of entire\nA2319 and A2319A subgroup for the first time, though any velocity difference\nwithin the region is not detected. On the other hand, we do not find any signs\nof gas motion relevant to A2319B subgroup. Hard X-ray emission from the cluster\nis clearly detected, but its spectrum is likely thermal. Assuming a simple\nsingle temperature model for the thermal component, we find that the upper\nlimit of the non-thermal inverse Compton component becomes $2.6 \\times\n10^{-11}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ in the 10-40 keV band, which means that the\nlower limit of the magnetic field is 0.19 $\\mu$G with the radio spectral index\n0.92.

It is generally expected that as density increases,\nthe electron chemical potential will increase and new degrees of freedom will\nemerge as mu_e becomes comparable to their energy scales. Assuming the\nelectrical neutrality and beta equilibrium for the stellar matter, we have\nstudied how the density dependence of lepton chemical potentials varies for\ndifferent models of nuclear interactions that are constrained by experiments up\nto nuclear matter density, n_0, but extrapolate differently(unconstrained)\nbeyond n_0 and calculated the relative abundances of nucleons(neutron and\nproton) and leptons(electron and muon) and their density dependencies. We find\nthat the density dependence of the electron chemical potential is strongly\ndependent on the structure of the nuclear symmetry energy relevant to\nsoftness/stfness of the nuclear matter EOS that measures the energy relevant to\nthe neutron-proton asymmetry. As a consequence, the relative abundances of\nneutrons, protons, electrons, and muons as well as the kaon condensation are\nstrongly dependent on the nuclear symmetry energy. An intriguing result in our\nfinding is that contrary to the accepted lore, kaon condensation in neutron\nstar matter, which is considered to be the first phase transitions beyond n_0\nand plays a crucial role in certain scenarios of compact-star formation, is not\ndirectly tied to the softness or stiffness of the EOS beyond n_0.

These data are\nwidely believed to provide an accurate and solid basis for future decisions\nabout nuclear energy. Unfortunately, as it is demonstrated in this paper, they\ndo not.\n  The conventional worldwide uranium resources are estimated by the authors of\nthe Red Book as 5.5 million tons. Out of these, 3.3 million tons are assigned\nto the reasonable assured category and 2.2 million tons are associated with the\nnot yet discovered but assumed to exist inferred resources. Our analysis shows\nthat neither the 3.3 million tons of \"assured\" resources nor the 2.2 million\ntons of inferred resources are justified by the Red Book data and that the\nactual known exploitable resources are probably much smaller.\n  Despite many shortcomings of the uranium resource data, some interesting and\nvaluable information can be extracted from the Red Book. Perhaps most\nimportantly, the Red Book resource data can be used to test the\n\"economic-geological hypothesis\", which claims for example that a doubling of\nuranium price will increase the amount exploitable uranium resources by an even\nlarger factor. The relations between the uranium resources claimed for the\ndifferent resource categories and their associated cost estimates are found to\nbe in clear contradiction with this hypothesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2009 08:22:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-09"}

We investigate disc-planet interactions in these subkeplerian\ndiscs, focusing on orbital migration for low-mass planets and gap formation for\nhigh-mass planets. We use linear calculations and nonlinear hydrodynamical\nsimulations to measure the torque and look at gap formation. In both cases, the\nsubkeplerian nature of the disc is treated as a fixed external constraint. We\nshow that, depending on the degree to which the disc is subkeplerian, the\ntorque on low-mass planets varies between the usual Type I torque and the\none-sided outer Lindblad torque, which is also negative but an order of\nmagnitude stronger. In strongly subkeplerian discs, corotation effects can be\nignored, making migration fast and inward. Gap formation near the planet's\norbit is more difficult in such discs, since there are no resonances close to\nthe planet accommodating angular momentum transport. In stead, the location of\nthe gap is shifted inwards with respect to the planet, leaving the planet on\nthe outside of a surface density depression. Depending on the degree to which a\nprotoplanetary disc is subkeplerian, disc-planet interactions can be very\ndifferent from the usual Keplerian picture, making these discs in general more\nhazardous for young planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2009 09:20:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2009 08:41:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Its main target is to significantly improve\nthe experimental control of the relative polarisation of the W+, W- and Z\nbosons.

It must be followed by dedicated\nmeasurement strategies which are robust with respect to both the systematic\nmeasurement uncertainties and to the perturbative and non-perturbative QCD\neffects. We propose such strategies and evaluate their precision. At the LHC,\ncontrary to the Tevatron case, both the masses of the W+ and of the W- bosons\nmust be measured with high precision. In this context, we propose and evaluate\nLHC dedicated strategies to measure the difference of the masses of the W+ and\nW- bosons and of the absolute mass of the W boson assuming both masses are\nequal.

The predators\nperform independent random walks on a square lattice with V sites and start a\ndirect chase whenever the prey appears within their sighting range. The prey is\ncaught when a predator jumps to the site occupied by the prey. We analyze the\nefficacy of a lazy, minimal-effort evasion strategy according to which the prey\ntries to avoid encounters with the predators by making a hop only when any of\nthe predators appears within its sighting range; otherwise the prey stays\nstill. We show that if the sighting range of such a lazy prey is equal to 1\nlattice spacing, at least 3 predators are needed in order to catch the prey on\na square lattice. In this situation, we establish a simple asymptotic relation\nln(Pev)(t) \\sim (N/V)2ln(Pimm(t)) between the survival probabilities of an\nevasive and an immobile prey. Hence, when the density of the predators is low\nN/V<<1, the lazy evasion strategy leads to the spectacular increase of the\nsurvival probability. We also argue that a short-sighting prey (its sighting\nrange is smaller than the sighting range of the predators) undergoes an\neffective superdiffusive motion, as a result of its encounters with the\npredators, whereas a far-sighting prey performs a diffusive-type motion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2009 09:56:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-08"}

In slow rotators, the indirect effect of the modification\nof the eigenfunctions on mode excitation is investigated by performing a\nperturbative analysis of the excitation rates.

A nova is a transient supersoft X-ray\nsource (SSS) in its later phase which timescale depends strongly on the WD\nmass. The X-ray turn on/off time is a good indicator of the WD mass. At an\nintermediate mass-accretion rate an accreting WD becomes a persistent SSS with\nsteady hydrogen burning.
