For the latter extensive efforts have\nbeen made but with limited success to generalize the Zwanzig-Mori projection\nformalism, originally developed for Hamiltonian systems close to thermodynamic\nequilibrium, to general non-Hamiltonian systems lacking detailed-balance. One\ndifficulty introduced by such systems is the lack of an invariant measure,\nneeded to define a statistical distribution. Based on a recent discovery that a\nnon-Hamiltonian system defined by a set of stochastic differential equations\ncan be mapped to a Hamiltonian system, we develop such general projection\nformalism. In the resulting generalized Langevin equations, a set of\ngeneralized fluctuation-dissipation relations connect the memory kernel and the\nrandom noise terms, analogous to Hamiltonian systems obeying detailed balance.\nLacking of these relations restricts previous application of the generalized\nLangevin formalism. Result of this work may serve as the theoretical basis for\nfurther technical developments on model reconstruction with reduced degrees of\nfreedom. We first use an analytically solvable example to illustrate the\nformalism and the fluctuation-dissipation relation. Our numerical test on a\nchemical network with end-product inhibition further demonstrates the validity\nof the formalism.

The coarse--grained quantities are all\nquasi-local functionals, depending only on the geometry of the boundary of the\nconsidered domain. They can be thought of as relativistic generalizations of\nsimple volume averages of local quantities in a flat space. The procedure is\nbased on the isometric embedding theorem for S^2 surfaces and thus requires the\nboundary of the domain in question to have spherical topology and positive\nscalar curvature. We prove that in the limit of infinitesimally small volume\nthe proposed quantities reproduce the local expansion, shear and vorticity. In\ncase of irrotational flow we derive the time evolution for the coarse-grained\nquantities and show that its structure is very similar to the evolution\nequation for their local counterparts. Additional terms appearing in it may\nserve as a measure of the backreacton of small-scale inhomogeneities of the\nflow on the large-scale motion of the fluid inside the domain and therefore the\nresult may be interesting in the context of the cosmological backreaction\nproblem. We also consider the application of the proposed coarse-graining\nprocedure to a number of known exact solutions of Einstein equations with dust\nand show that it yields reasonable results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2009 18:20:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2009 12:32:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2009 01:15:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 2010 16:54:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

We investigate\nthe precision that can be achieved in radial velocity measurements of low mass\nstars in the near infrared (nIR) Y-, J-, and H-bands, and we compare it to the\nprecision achievable in the optical. For early-M stars, radial velocity\nmeasurements in the nIR offer no or only marginal advantage in comparison to\noptical measurements. Although they emit more flux in the nIR, the richness of\nspectral features in the optical outweighs the flux difference. We find that\nnIR measurement can be as precise than optical measurements in stars of\nspectral type ~M4, and from there the nIR gains in precision towards cooler\nobjects. We studied potential calibration strategies in the nIR finding that a\nstable spectrograph with a ThAr calibration can offer enough wavelength\nstability for m/s precision. Furthermore, we simulate the wavelength-dependent\ninfluence of activity (cool spots) on radial velocity measurements from optical\nto nIR wavelengths. Our spot simulations reveal that the radial velocity jitter\ndoes not decrease as dramatically towards longer wavelengths as often thought.\nThe jitter strongly depends on the details of the spots, i.e., on spot\ntemperature and the spectral appearance of the spot. Forthcoming nIR\nspectrographs will allow the search for planets with a particular advantage in\nmid- and late-M stars.

Our final sample consists of\n119 (141) sources selected in the redshift interval z=0.195-0.44 (z=0.65-1.25)\nfrom the FUV (NUV) channel. We classify the Ly-alpha sources as AGNs if\nhigh-ionization emission lines are present in their UV spectra and as possible\nstar-forming galaxies otherwise. We classify additional sources as AGNs using\nline widths for our Ly-alpha emitter (LAE) analysis. These classifications are\nbroadly supported by comparisons with X-ray and optical spectroscopic\nobservations. Defining the GALEX LAE sample in the same way as high-redshift\nLAE samples, we show that LAEs constitute only about 5% of NUV-continuum\nselected galaxies at z~0.3. We also show that they are less common at z~0.3\nthan they are at z~3. We find that the z~0.3 optically-confirmed Ly-alpha\ngalaxies lie below the metallicity-luminosity relation of the z~0.3\nNUV-continuum selected galaxies but have similar H-alpha velocity widths at\nsimilar luminosities, suggesting that they also lie below the metallicity-mass\nrelation of the NUV-continuum selected galaxies. We show that, on average, the\nLy-alpha galaxies have bluer colors, lower extinctions as measured from the\nBalmer line ratios, and more compact morphologies than the NUV-continuum\nselected galaxies. Finally, we confirm that the z~2 Lyman break galaxies (LBGs)\nhave relatively low metallicities for their luminosities, and we find that they\nlie in the same metallicity range as the z~0.3 Ly-alpha galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2009 20:39:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2010 00:40:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

The analysis yields stellar effective temperatures, gravities,\ninterstellar reddening, and extinction, the combination of which provides a\ndistance estimate via the Flux-weighted Gravity--Luminosity Relationship\n(FGLR). This result is based on an FGLR calibration that is continually being\npolished. An average reddening of <E(B-V)> ~ 0.08 mag is found, with a large\nvariation ranging from 0.01 to 0.16 mag however, demonstrating the importance\nof accurate individual reddening measurements for stellar distance indicators\nin galaxies with evident signatures of interstellar absorption. The large\ndistance modulus found is in good agreement with recent work on eclipsing\nbinaries, planetary nebulae, long period variables, RR Lyrae stars, and also\nwith HST observations of Cepheids, if reasonable reddening assumptions are made\nfor the Cepheids. Since distances based on the tip of the red giant branch\n(TRGB) method found in the literature give conflicting results, we have used\nHST ACS V- and I-band images of outer regions of M 33 to determine a TRGB\ndistance of 24.84 +/- 0.10 mag, in basic agreement with the FGLR result. We\nhave also determined stellar metallicities and discussed the metallicity\ngradient in the disk of M33.

The currently increased INTEGRAL data\nstimulate us to investigate the reality of this source. We analyze all\navailable observations carried out by INTEGRAL and Swift on IGR J19405-3016. We\nfind that IGR J19405-3016 has a detection significance of ~ 9.4 sigma in the\n20-60 keV band during the observational period between March 2003 and March\n2008. Thus confirms a real source detection reported previously. The source\nposition and error location are therefore updated. The source is found to be\nconstant over years at the hard X-rays. Over the three XRT observations, the\nsource flux varied by up to 39% from the average, and the spectrum is generally\nsoft. The combined XRT/ISGRI spectrum is well fitted with a simple power law\nmodel (photon index 2.11+-0.03). Such a photon index is well consistent with\nthe mean value 1.98 (dispersion 0.27) as obtained from Swift/BAT AGN samples at\n14-195 keV. The spectral slope of IGR J19405-3016 is larger than the average\nspectral slope found by Molina et al. (2009). A similar discrepancy is found\nwith the results of Beckmann et al. (2009) regarding Seyfert 1 AGNs. A possible\nexplanation of this simple spectral description may be that the low level of\nthe column density allows for the `true' spectrum to appear at soft X-rays as\nwell.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2009 02:55:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The main characteristic of this measure is the invariance with\nrespect to the effect of the evolution operator on the environment, which\nfollows from an equivalence relation that exists between unitary operators\nacting on the composite system, when the effect on only the sub-system of\ninterest is considered. The invariance to the environment's transformation\nmakes it possible to quantitatively compare the evolution of an open quantum\nsystem and its closed counterpart. The distance measure also determines the\nfidelity bounds of a general quantum channel (a completely positive and\ntrace-preserving map acting on the sub-system of interest) with respect to a\nunitary target transformation. This measure is also independent of the initial\nstate of the system and straightforward to numerically calculate. As an\nexample, the measure is used in numerical simulations to evaluate fidelities of\noptimally controlled quantum gate operations (for one- and two-qubit systems),\nin the presence of a decohering environment.

In EELAR a reference wireless base station is used and\nthe network's circular area centered at the base station is divided into six\nequal sub-areas. At route discovery instead of flooding control packets to the\nwhole network area, they are flooded to only the sub-area of the destination\nmobile node.

We find that, at a fixed size, the star-formation rate density\nwithin these HII regions is approximately two orders of magnitude greater than\nthose observed in local spiral/starburst galaxies, but consistent with the most\nmassive HII regions in the local Universe such as 30Dor. Finally, we compare\nthe spatially resolved nebular emission line velocity with the Ly-alpha and\nUV-ISM lines and find that this galaxy is surrounded by a galactic scale\noutflow in which the Ly-alpha appears redshifted by ~150km/s and the UV-ISM\nlines blue-shifted by -200km/s from the (systemic) nebular emission. The\nvelocity structure of the outflow mirrors that of the nebular emission\nsuggesting the outflow is young (~15Myr), and has yet to burst out of the\nsystem. Taken together, these results suggest that this young galaxy is\nundergoing its first major epoch of mass assembly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2009 07:10:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

One of the resonant caustic lensing events, OGLE-2005-BLG-169, was a\ncaustic-crossing high-magnification event with $A_{max} \\sim$ 800 and the\nsource star was much smaller than the caustic, nevertheless the perturbation\nwas not obviously apparent on the light curve of the event. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the perturbation pattern of the resonant caustic to understand why\nthe perturbations induced by the caustic do not leave strong traces on the\nlight curves of high-magnification events despite a small source/caustic size\nratio. From this study, we find that the regions with\nsmall-magnification-excess around the center of the resonant caustic are rather\nwidely formed, and the event passing the small-excess region produces a\nhigh-magnification event with a weak perturbation that is small relative to the\namplification caused by the star and thus does not noticeably appear on the\nlight curve of the event. We also find that the positive excess of the inside\nedge of the resonant caustic and the negative excess inside the caustic become\nstronger and wider as $q$ increases, and thus the resonant caustic-crossing\nhigh-magnification events with the weak perturbation occur in the range of $q\n\\leqslant 10^{-4}$. We determine the probability of the occurrence of events\nwith the small excess $|\\epsilon| \\leqslant 3 %$ in high-magnification events\ninduced by a resonant caustic. As a result, we find that for the Earth-mass\nplanets with a separation of ~ 2.5 AU, the resonant caustic high-magnification\nevents with the weak perturbation can occur with a significant frequency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2009 07:16:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

By using the scale-length method,\nwe test whether this assumption is satisfied in several samples of the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey Data Release Six. We find that the probability density\nfunction (PDF) of conditional fluctuations, filtered on large enough spatial\nscales (i.e., r>30 Mpc/h), shows relevant systematic variations in different\nsub-volumes of the survey. Instead for scales r<30 Mpc/h the PDF is\nstatistically stable, and its first moment presents scaling behavior with a\nnegative exponent around one. Thus while up to 30 Mpc/h galaxy structures have\nwell-defined power-law correlations, on larger scales it is not possible to\nconsider whole sample average quantities as meaningful and useful statistical\ndescriptors. This situation is due to the fact that galaxy structures\ncorrespond to density fluctuations which are too large in amplitude and too\nextended in space to be self-averaging on such large scales inside the sample\nvolumes: galaxy distribution is inhomogeneous up to the largest scales, i.e. r\n~ 100 Mpc/h, probed by the SDSS samples. We show that cosmological corrections,\nas K-corrections and standard evolutionary corrections, do not qualitatively\nchange the relevant behaviors. Finally we show that the large amplitude galaxy\nfluctuations observed in the SDSS samples are at odds with the predictions of\nthe standard LCDM model of structure formation.(Abridged version).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2009 09:36:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 2009 09:05:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-02"}

This paper provides a cubic algorithm for checking\nconsistency of basic CDC constraint networks, and proves that reasoning with\nCDC is in general an NP-Complete problem.

State density reduces in all\nenergy bands, including conduction band (CB). Hence, electrons, rejected from\nthe filled bands, must occupy quantum states in the empty bands due to Pauli\nExclusion principle.

It is also demonstrated that the\ntotal energy of such a solution is equal to zero and that there are regions\nwithin the light cone with negative $(-)$ and positive $(+)$ total energies.\nFor certain equations of state there is a continuous energy transfer from the\n$(-)$-regions to the $(+)$-regions resulting in indefinite growth of energy in\nthe $(+)$ regions with time, which may be interpreted as action of a specific\n'Perpetuum Mobile' (Perpetuum Motion). It is speculated that if it is possible\nto construct a three-dimensional non-stationary flow of an exotic fluid having\na finite negative value of energy such a situation would also occur. Such a\nflow may continuously transfer positive energy to gravitational waves,\nresulting in a runaway. It is conjectured that theories plagued by such\nsolutions should be discarded as inherently unstable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2009 14:15:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In this paper, we\nanalyze the consequences of a temporal change in this figure on the luminosity.\nTo do so, we use the Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) as an indicator of\nluminosity. Considering that most of the authors have explained the largest\npart of the TSI modulation with magnetic network (spots and faculae) but not\nthe whole, we could set constraints on radius and effective temperature\nvariations (dR, dT). However computations show that the amplitude of solar\nirradiance modulation is very sensitive to photospheric temperature variations.\nIn order to understand discrepancies between our best fit and recent\nobservations of Livingston et al. (2005), showing no effective surface\ntemperature variation during the solar cycle, we investigated small effective\ntemperature variation in irradiance modeling. We emphasized a phase-shift\n(correlated or anticorrelated radius and irradiance variations) in the (dR,\ndT)-parameter plane. We further obtained an upper limit on the amplitude of\ncyclic solar radius variations, deduced from the gravitational energy\nvariations. Our estimate is consistent with both observations of the\nhelioseismic radius through the analysis of f-mode frequencies and observations\nof the basal photospheric temperature at Kitt Peak. Finally, we suggest a\nmechanism to explain faint changes in the solar shape due to variation of\nmagnetic pressure which modifies the granules size. This mechanism is supported\nby our estimate of the asphericity-luminosity parameter, which implies an\neffectiveness of convective heat transfer only in very outer layers of the Sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2009 14:39:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-31"}

We\nshow that in quantum theories of gravity in which the zero-point energy density\nof the gravitational field is well-defined, the cosmological constant and\nzero-point energy problems solve each other by mutual cancellation between the\ncosmological constant and the matter and gravitational field zero-point energy\ndensities. Because of this cancellation, regulation of the matter field\nzero-point energy density is not needed, and thus does not cause any trace\nanomaly to arise. We exhibit our results in two theories of gravity that are\nwell-defined quantum-mechanically. Both of these theories are locally conformal\ninvariant, quantum Einstein gravity in two dimensions and Weyl-tensor-based\nquantum conformal gravity in four dimensions (a fourth-order derivative quantum\ntheory of the type that Bender and Mannheim have recently shown to be\nghost-free and unitary). Central to our approach is the requirement that any\nand all departures of the geometry from Minkowski are to be brought about by\nquantum mechanics alone. Consequently, there have to be no fundamental\nclassical fields, and all mass scales have to be generated by dynamical\ncondensates. In such a situation the trace of the matter field energy-momentum\ntensor is zero, a constraint that obliges its cosmological constant and\nzero-point contributions to cancel each other identically, no matter how large\nthey might be. Quantization of the gravitational field is caused by its\ncoupling to quantized matter fields, with the gravitational field not needing\nany independent quantization of its own. With there being no a priori classical\ncurvature, one does not have to make it compatible with quantization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2009 15:50:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2009 14:52:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2009 19:02:09 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2010 19:59:14 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 2010 16:17:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-23"}

At lower pin\nconcentrations, we find, for temperatures of the order of the melting\ntemperature of the unpinned lattice, a Bose glass type phase which at lower\ntemperatures converts, via a first order transition, to a Bragg glass, while,\nat higher temperatures, it crosses over to an interstitial liquid. At somewhat\nhigher concentrations, no transition to a Bragg glass is found even at the\nlowest temperatures studied.
