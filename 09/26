Here, we note that assumptions on which the theorem is based exclude\nphase transitions between gapped (Mott insulator) and gapless phases (Bose\nglass). The apparent paradox is resolved through a unique mechanism: such\ntransitions have to be of the Griffiths type when the vanishing of the gap at\nthe critical point is due to a zero concentration of rare regions where extreme\nfluctuations of disorder mimic a {\\it regular} gapless system. An exactly\nsolvable random transverse field Ising model in one dimension is used to\nillustrate the point. A highly non-trivial overall shape of the phase diagram\nis revealed with the worm algorithm. The phase diagram features a long\nsuperfluid finger at strong disorder and on-site interaction. Moreover, bosonic\nsuperfluidity is extremely robust against disorder in a broad range of\ninteraction parameters; it persists in random potentials nearly 50 (!) times\nlarger than the particle half-bandwidth. Finally, we comment on the feasibility\nof obtaining this phase diagram in cold-atom experiments, which work with\ntrapped systems at finite temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 2009 19:51:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-10"}

The\nspatially resolved spectral data cube was used in the kinematic, morphological\nand abundance analysis of the ejecta. The line maps show a very clumpy shell\nwith two main symmetric structures. The first one is the outer part of the\nshell seen in H-alpha, that forms two rings projected in the sky plane. These\nring structures correspond to a closed hourglass shape, first proposed by\nHarman and O'Brien (2003). The equatorial emission enhancement is caused by the\nsuperimposed hourglass structures in the line of sight. The second structure\nseen only in the [OIII] and [NII] maps is located along the polar directions\ninside the hourglass structure. Abundances gradients between the polar caps and\nequatorial region were not found. However, the outer part of the shell seems to\nbe less abundant in Oxygen and Nitrogen than the inner regions. Detailed 2.5D\nphotoionization modeling of the 3D shell was performed using the mass\ndistribution inferred from the observations and the presence of mass clumps.\nThe resulting model grids are used to constrain the physical properties of the\nshell as well as the central ionizing source. A sequence of 3D clumpy models\nincluding a disk shaped ionization source is able to reproduce the ionization\ngradients between polar and equatorial regions of the shell. Differences\nbetween shell axial ratios in different lines can also be explained by\naspherical illumination. A total shell mass of 9 x 10-4 Msun is derived from\nthese models. We estimate that 50% to 70% of the shell mass is contained in\nneutral clumps with density contrast up to a factor of 30.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 2009 19:48:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2009 17:45:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Additionally, the\nmaximal up-flow velocity in penumbrae is smaller, while the maximal down-flow\nvelocity is larger with respect to the QS velocities. Furthermore, on a spatial\naverage, the penumbra shows a red-shift, corresponding to a down-flow of more\nthan 0.1 km/s. Up-flows are elongated and appear predominately in the inner\npenumbra.

On the other hand, the WMAP experiment has shown that the\ngravitational field produced by dark matter amplifies the higher acoustic modes\nof the CMBR power spectrum, more intensely than the gravitational field of\nbaryons. Such a wide range of experimental evidences from cosmology to local\ngravity suggests the necessity of a comprehensive analysis of the dark matter\ngravitational field per se, regardless of any other attributes that dark matter\nmay eventually possess.\n  In this paper we introduce and apply Nash's theory of perturbative geometry\nto the study of the dark matter gravitational field alone, in a\nhigher-dimensional framework. It is shown that the dark matter gravitational\nperturbations in the early universe can be explained by the extrinsic curvature\nof the standard cosmology. Together with the estimated presence of massive\nneutrinos, such geometric perturbation is compatible not only with the observed\npower spectrum in the WMAP experiment but also with the most recent data on the\naccelerated expansion of the universe.\n  It is possible that the same structure formation exists locally, such as in\nthe cases of young galaxies or in cluster collisions. In most other cases it\nseems to have ceased when the extrinsic curvature becomes negligible, leading\nto Einstein's equations in four dimensions.

The primary focus of our\nstudy is the characteristic distribution function of linear sizes (SDF) of the\nGCs. We measure the effective radii for 652 clusters with PSF-convolved King\nand Wilson dynamical model fits. The SDF is remarkably similar to those\nmeasured for other large galaxies of all types, adding strong support to the\nview that it is a \"universal\" feature of globular cluster systems.\n  We develop a more general interpretation of the size distribution function\nfor globular clusters, proposing that the shape of the SDF that we see today\nfor GCs is strongly influenced by the early rapid mass loss during their star\nforming stage, coupled with stochastic differences from cluster to cluster in\nthe star formation efficiency (SFE) and their initial sizes. We find that the\nobserved SDF shape can be accurately predicted by a simple model in which the\nprotocluster clouds had characteristic sizes of $0.9 \\pm 0.1$ pc and SFEs of\n$0.3 \\pm 0.07$. The colors and luminosities of the M104 clusters show the\nclearly defined classic bimodal form. The blue sequence exhibits a\nmass/metallicity relation (MMR), following a scaling of heavy-element abundance\nwith luminosity of $Z \\sim L^{0.3}$ very similar to what has been found in most\ngiant elliptical galaxies. A quantitative self-enrichment model provides a good\nfirst-order match to the data for the same initial SFE and protocluster size\nthat were required to explain the SDF.

The difficulty arises due to the\ncomplex signal interactions induced in the network, since the wireless channel\ninherently broadcasts the signals and there is interference among\ntransmissions. Recently, Avestimehr, Diggavi and Tse proposed a linear\ndeterministic model that takes into account the shared nature of wireless\nchannels, focusing on the signal interactions rather than the background noise.\nThey generalized the min-cut max-flow theorem for graphs to networks of\ndeterministic channels and proved that the capacity can be achieved using\ninformation theoretical tools.

Our algorithm\ncrucially uses a notion of linear independence between channels to calculate\nthe capacity in polynomial time. Moreover, we can achieve the capacity by using\nvery simple one-symbol processing at the intermediate nodes, thereby\nconstructively yielding finite length strategies that achieve the unicast\ncapacity of the linear deterministic (wireless) relay network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 2009 21:33:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}

The connection with electroweak precision tests is developed. A\nnoteworthy result is that the correct treatment of the Higgs VEV leads to an\nincrease of the lower limit at 95% C.L. on KK masses that can reach +30% (from\nusually accepted values). For a Higgs mass 120 GeV < m_h < 150 GeV, the\nobtained limit [from updated precision data] on the first KK gauge boson mass\nlies in the range 3.3 - 4.0 TeV.

In this framework, we solve the perturbation equation\nwith initial data and a number of results are derived. Far from the horizon of\na black hole of even space dimension $N$, a mass-less field decays as ${r^l}\n{{(-{r^2}+{t^2})}^{\\frac{1-N}{2}-l}}$ in space-time, where $l$ is a harmonic\nnumber of the sphere. A relation of energy and momentum of a particle with mass\nin a hyper black hole is discovered and a solution to the equation of\nKlein-Gordon in the metric of Schwarzschild-Tangherlini with initial data on\nthe hypersphere is proposed. Also, the Green's function of the Klein-Gordon\nequation in Schwarzschild coordinates is calculated. This function is a sum on\nthe harmonic modes of the sphere. The first term is a double integration on the\nspectrum of energy and the momentum of the particle. Far from the horizon, the\ndouble integration is approximated by an integration on a line defined by the\nrelation of energy and momentum of a free particle. From here, the potential of\nYukawa is derived. Finally, the linear perturbation equations are derived and\nsolved exactly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Sep 2009 00:15:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}

An infinitely long flagellum\nachieves a hydrodynamically optimal low-Reynolds number locomotion when the\nangle between its local tangent and the swimming direction remains constant\nalong its length. Optimal flagella therefore adopt the shape of a helix in\nthree dimensions (smooth) and that of a sawtooth in two dimensions\n(non-smooth). Physically, biological organisms (or engineered micro-swimmers)\nmust expend internal energy in order to produce the waves of deformation\nresponsible for the motion. Here we propose a physically-motivated derivation\nof the optimal flagellum shape. We determine analytically and numerically the\nshape of the flagellar wave which leads to the fastest swimming while\nminimizing an appropriately-defined energetic expenditure. Our novel approach\nis to define an energy which includes not only the work against the surrounding\nfluid, but also (1) the energy stored elastically in the bending of the\nflagellum, (2) the energy stored elastically in the internal sliding of the\npolymeric filaments which are responsible for the generation of the bending\nwaves (microtubules), and (3) the viscous dissipation due to the presence of an\ninternal fluid. This approach regularizes the optimal sawtooth shape for\ntwo-dimensional deformation at the expense of a small loss in hydrodynamic\nefficiency. The optimal waveforms of finite-size flagella are shown to depend\nupon a competition between rotational motions and bending costs, and we observe\na surprising bias towards half-integer wave-numbers. Their final hydrodynamic\nefficiencies are above 6%, significantly larger than those of swimming cells,\ntherefore indicating available room for further biological tuning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Sep 2009 02:43:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-03"}
