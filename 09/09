This grid of models covers most of\nthe expected combinations of stellar parameters, which are made up of the\nstellar temperature, the stellar luminosity, the stellar mass, the abundance of\ncondensible carbon, and the velocity amplitude of the pulsation. The resultant\nmass-loss rates and wind speeds are clearly affected by the choice of stellar\ntemperature, mass, luminosity and the abundance of available carbon. In certain\nparts of the parameter space there is also an inevitable mass-loss threshold,\nbelow which a dust-driven wind is not possible. Contrary to some previous\nstudies, we find a strong dependence on the abundance of free carbon, which\nturns out to be a critical parameter. Furthermore, we have found that the dust\ngrains that form in the atmosphere may grow too large for the commonly used\nsmall particle approximation of the dust opacity to be strictly valid. This may\nhave some bearing on the wind properties, although further study of this\nproblem is needed before quantitative conclusions can be drawn. The wind\nproperties show relatively simple dependences on stellar parameters above the\nmass-loss threshold, while the threshold itself is of a more complicated\nnature. Hence, we chose not to derive any simplistic mass-loss formula, but\nrather provide a mass-loss prescription in the form of an easy-to-use FORTRAN\nroutine. Since this mass-loss routine is based on data coming from an\nessentially self-consistent model of mass loss, it may therefore serve as a\nbetter mass-loss prescription for stellar evolution calculations than empirical\nformulae. Furthermore, we conclude that there are still some issues that need\nto be investigated, such as the role of grain-sizes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2009 18:50:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2009 09:13:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-11"}

They are `fed' internally by\nsources of plasma from moons such as Enceladus (Saturn) and Io (Jupiter). We\nuse a scaled form of Euler potentials for the Jovian magnetodisc field (Caudal,\n1986). In this formalism, the magnetic field is assumed to be azimuthally\nsymmetric about the planet's axis of rotation, and plasma temperature is\nconstant along a field line. We perturb the dipole potential by using\nsimplified distributions of plasma pressure and angular velocity for both\nplanets, based on observations by Cassini (Saturn) and Voyager (Jupiter). Our\nresults quantify the degree of radial `stretching' exerted on the dipolar field\nlines through the plasma's rotational motion and pressure. A simplified version\nof the field model, the `homogeneous disc', can be used to easily estimate the\ndistance of transition in the outer magnetosphere between pressure-dominated\nand centrifugally-dominated disc structure. We comment on the degree of\nequatorial confinement as represented by the scale height associated with disc\nions of varying mass and temperature. For Saturn, we identify the principal\nforces which contribute to the magnetodisc current and make comparisons between\nthe field structure predicted by the model and magnetic field measurements from\nCassini. For Jupiter, we reproduce Caudal's original calculation in order to\nvalidate our model implementation.

These magnetic fields can weaken the positive correlation between\nthe arrival directions of HECRs and the positions of their sources. In order to\nexplore the effect of GMF on the expected correlation, we simulate the arrival\ndistribution of protons with the energy above $6 \\times 10^{19}$ eV taking\nseveral GMF models into account, and then test the correlation between the\nprotons and their sources assumed in the simulation. The dependence of the\ncorrelation signals on GMF models are also investigated. The correlation can be\nobserved by accumulating $\\sim 200$ protons in a half hemisphere. Typical\nangular scale at which the positive signal of the correlation is maximized\ndepends on the spiral component of GMF models. That angular scale is $\\sim 5^o$\nfor bisymmetric spiral (BS) GMF models and $\\sim 7^o$ for axisymmetric spiral\n(AS) GMF models if the number density of HECR sources, $n_s$, is $\\sim 10^{-4}$\nMpc$^{-3}$. An additional vertical (dipole) component of GMF affects these\nangular scale by $0.5^o$ - $1^o$. The difference between the correlation signal\nfor the BS models and that for the AS models is prominent in the northern sky.\nSignificance of the positive correlation depends on source distribution. The\nprobability that the number of simulated HECR events correlating with sources\nis smaller than the number of random events correlating with the same sources\nby chance is much less than $10^{-3}$ ($\\sim 3\\sigma$) in almost all the source\ndistributions with $n_s = 10^{-4}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ under 200 protons detection, but\n$\\sim 10\\%$ of source distributions predicts the chance probability more than\n$10^{-3}$ in the AS GMF model.

Fast outflows\nare detected from the majority of stars and about 40 percent of the outflows\nhave sufficient speed to allow escape of material from the star as well as from\na globular cluster. Outflow speeds and line strengths do not depend on\nmetallicity suggesting the driving mechanism for these winds derives from\nmagnetic and/or hydrodynamic processes. Gas outflows are present in every\nluminous giant, but are not detected in all stars of lower luminosity\nindicating possible variability. Mass loss rates ranging from 3X10(-10) to\n6X10(-8) solar mass/yr estimated from the Sobolev approximation represent\nvalues with evolutionary significance for red giant branch (RGB) and red\nhorizontal branch (RHB) stars. We estimate that 0.2 M_sun will be lost on the\nRGB, and the torque of this wind can account for observations of slowly\nrotating RHB stars in the field. About 0.1-0.2 M_sun will be lost on the RHB\nitself. This first empirical determination of mass loss on the RHB may\ncontribute to the appearance of extended horizontal branches in globular\nclusters. The spectra appear to resolve the problem of missing intracluster\nmaterial in globular clusters. Opportunities exist for 'wind smothering' of\ndwarf stars by winds from the evolved population, possibly leading to surface\npollution in regions of high stellar density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2009 20:02:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

While the generic spin-down age may give realistic estimates for\nnormal pulsars, it can fail for pulsars with very short periods. Details of the\nspin-up process during the low mass X-ray binary phase pose additional\nconstraints on the period (P) and spin-down rates (Pdot) that may consequently\naffect the age estimate. Here, we propose a new recipe to estimate millisecond\npulsar (MSP) ages that parametrically incorporates constraints arising from\nbinary evolution and limiting physics. We show that the standard method can be\nimproved by this approach to achieve age estimates closer to the true age\nwhilst the standard spin-down age may over- or under-estimate the age of the\npulsar by more than a factor of ~10 in the millisecond regime. We use this\napproach to analyze the population on a broader scale. For instance, in order\nto understand the dominant energy loss mechanism after the onset of radio\nemission, we test for a range of plausible braking indices. We find that a\nbraking index of n=3 is consistent with the observed MSP population. We\ndemonstrate the existence and quantify the potential contributions of two main\nsources of age corruption: the previously known \"age bias\" due to secular\nacceleration and \"age contamination\" driven by sub-Eddington progenitor\naccretion rates. We explicitly show that descendants of LMXBs that have\naccreted at very low rates will exhibit ages that appear older than the age of\nthe Galaxy.

Using the IAC 80cm telescope, we\nobserved transits of TrES-1 and TrES-2 over several years. Based on these new\ndata and previously published work, we studied the observed light curves and\nsearched for variations in the difference between observed and calculated\n(based on a fixed ephemeris) transit times. To model possible transit timing\nvariations, we used polynomials of different orders, simulated O-C diagrams\ncorresponding to a perturbing third mass and sinusoidal fits.

The 21 photometrically confirmed type ab RRLs have mean [Fe/H]\n= -1.79 +/- 0.08, consistent with the abundances found for RRLs in a different\nportion of the Sgr tidal debris stream. The distribution of velocities in the\nGalactic standard of rest frame (V_GSR) of the 26 RRLs in the region is not\nconsistent with a smooth halo population. Upon comparison with the Sgr\ndisruption models of Law et al (2005), a prominent group of five stars having\nhighly negative radial velocities (V_GSR ~ -175 kms-1) is consistent with\npredictions for old trailing debris when the Galactic halo is modeled as\noblate. The observations also require that the recent trailing debris stream\nhas a broader spread perpendicular to the Sgr plane than predicted by the\nmodels. We have also investigated the possible association of the Virgo Stellar\nStream (VSS) with Sgr debris by comparing radial velocities for RRLs in the\nregion with the same models, finding similarities in the velocity-position\ntrends. As suggested by our earlier work, the stars in the VSS region with\nlarge negative V_GSR values are likely to be old leading Sgr debris, but we\nfind that while old trailing Sgr debris may well make a contribution at\npositive V_GSR values, it is unlikely to fully account for the VSS feature.\nOverall we find that further modeling is needed, as trailing arm data generally\nfavors oblate models while leading arm data favors prolate models, with no\nsingle potential fitting all the observed data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2009 06:31:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

The value of an infinite word w is computed as the maximal\nvalue of all runs over w, and the value of a run as the maximum, limsup,\nliminf, limit average, or discounted sum of the transition weights. We\nintroduce probabilistic weighted automata, in which the transitions are chosen\nin a randomized (rather than nondeterministic) fashion. Under almost-sure\nsemantics (resp. positive semantics), the value of a word w is the largest real\nv such that the runs over w have value at least v with probability 1 (resp.\npositive probability).\n  We study the classical questions of automata theory for probabilistic\nweighted automata: emptiness and universality, expressiveness, and closure\nunder various operations on languages.

The phase space dimension is typically much larger than\nthe number of ensemble members which leads to inaccurate results in the\ncomputed covariance matrices.

In this paper, we propose a new\ntechnique for implementing such localization techniques within the class of\nensemble transform/square root Kalman filters. Our approach relies on a\ncontinuous embedding of the Kalman filter update for the ensemble members,\ni.e., we state an ordinary differential equation (ODE) whose solutions, over a\nunit time interval, are equivalent to the Kalman filter update. The ODE\nformulation forms a gradient system with the observations as a cost functional.\nBesides localization, the new ODE ensemble formulation should also find useful\napplications in the context of nonlinear observation operators and observations\narriving continuously in time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2009 11:13:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2009 10:00:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2010 23:37:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-22"}

Aims: To\nsearch for H2O masers towards a large sample of young high mass stars and to\ninvestigate the statistical correlation of H2O masers with the earliest stages\nof massive star formation. Methods: We have used the Mopra Radio telescope to\nmake position-switched observations towards ~500 UCHII regions and MYSOs\ncandidates identified from the RMS survey and located between 190\\degr < l <\n30\\degr. These observations have a 4$\\sigma$ sensitivity of ~1 Jy and a\nvelocity resolution of ~0.4 km/s.} Results: We have detected 163 H2O masers,\napproximately 75% of which were previously unknown. Comparing the maser\nvelocities with the velocities of the RMS sources, determined from 13CO\nobservations, we have identified 135 RMS-H2O maser associations, which\ncorresponds to a detection rate of ~27%.

Conclusions: We find similar\ndetection rates for UCHII regions and MYSOs candidates, suggesting that the\nconditions needed for maser activity are equally likely in these two stages of\nthe star formation process. Looking at the detection rate as a function of\ndistance from the Galactic centre we find it significantly enhanced within the\nsolar circle, peaking at ~37% between 6-7 kpc, which is consistent with\nprevious surveys of UC HII regions, possibly indicating the presence of a high\nproportion of more luminous YSOs and HII regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2009 14:56:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The\ndifferent correlation degrees could be caused by the variety of optical and\nfar-infrared sample selection criteria. In order to obtain a census of the\ntypical properties of PAH emitting galaxies, we here study moderately distant\ngalaxies which have been selected by their PAH emission. Combining the ISOCAM\nParallel Survey at 6.7 micron with 2MASS we have colour-selected a sample of\n120 candidates for strong PAH emission. We obtained optical and mid-infrared\nspectra of 75 and 19 sources, respectively, and analysed IRAS-ADDSCANs and\navailable Spitzer 3.6-160 micron photometry. The Spitzer spectra exhibit clear\nPAH features and corroborate that our photometric selection criteria trace the\nPAH emission of galaxies fairly well. The optical spectra show emission lines,\nat median redshift z~0.1, as well as Hdelta and CaII absorption, indicating\nongoing starformation as well as post-starbursts. The mid- and far-infrared\nspectral energy distributions (SEDs) provide evidence for a broad range of\nfar-infrared (FIR) luminosities, but in general the dust is colder than for\nstarburst galaxies like M82. For most galaxies the monocromatic luminosity\npeaks at about equal height at optical, 6.7 micron (PAH) and FIR wavelengths.\nIn about 15% of the sources the FIR luminosity exceeds the optical and PAH\nenergy output by about a factor 5-10 despite the cool dust temperature; in\nthese galaxies a large dust mass of 10^8 - 10^9 M_sun is inferred.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2009 14:56:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}
