We are now exploring redshifts of 6 and beyond, when the Universe\nwas less than a billion years old, an epoch when the previously-neutral\nintergalactic medium was reionized. The continuing discovery of galaxies at\nprogressively higher and higher redshifts has been driven by the availability\nof large telescopes on the ground and in space, improvements in detector\ntechnology, and new search strategies. Over the past 4 years, the Lyman break\ntechnique has been shown to be effective in isolating z~6 star-forming i'-drop\ngalaxies through spectroscopic confirmation with large ground-based telescopes\n(Keck, Gemini and the ESO VLTs). Narrow-band imaging, notably with the wide\nfield of the Subaru telescope, has also produced samples of Lyman-alpha\nemitters at these redshifts. A The discovery of this i'-drop galaxy population\nhas been used to infer the global star formation rate density at this epoch\n(z~6), and we are now beginning to constrain the contribution to reionization\nof the UV flux from these galaxies. Infrared data from the Spitzer Space\nTelescope has been used to determine the spectral energy distributions (SEDs)\nfrom the rest-frame UV to the optical, and constrain the previous star\nformation histories, masses and ages. The indications are that much of the\nstellar mass of these galaxies might have formed in vigorous bursts at z>6. The\nnext big advances would be to test the population synthesis modelling of these\nz~6 galaxies through spectroscopy of the rest-frame optical (rather than crude\nbroad-band SEDs), and also to push the observational horizon for galaxies\nfurther to directly explore star formation during the reionization epoch. JWST\nis likely to have a profound impact on realising these goals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2009 19:54:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-10"}

First we perform\na linear stability analysis (LSA) of non-ideal MRI to derive the limiting value\nof Ohmic diffusion that is needed to inhibit the growth of the instability for\ndifferent types of rotation laws. With the help of a simple analytical\nexpression derived under first-order smoothing approximation (FOSA), an\nestimate of the limiting turbulence level and hence the turbulent diffusion\nneeded to damp the MRI is derived. Secondly, we perform numerical simulations\nin local cubes of isothermal nonstratified gas with external forcing of varying\nstrength to see whether the linear result holds for more complex systems.\nPurely hydrodynamic calculations with forcing, rotation and shear are made for\nreference purposes, and as expected, non-zero Reynolds stresses are found. In\nthe magnetohydrodynamic calculations, therefore, the total stresses generated\nare a sum of the forcing and MRI contributions. To separate these\ncontributions, we perform reference runs with MRI-stable shear profiles\n(angular velocity increasing outwards), which suggest that the MRI-generated\nstresses indeed become strongly suppressed as function of the forcing. The\nMaxwell to Reynolds stress ratio is observed to decrease by an order of\nmagnitude as the turbulence level due to external forcing exceeds the predicted\nlimiting value, which we interpret as a sign of MRI suppression. Finally, we\napply these results to estimate the limiting radius inside of which the SN\nactivity can suppress the MRI, arriving at a value of 14 kpc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2009 18:56:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2009 09:03:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

In a series\nof papers, we investigate the deep links between 2D self-consistent disc\nstructure and planetary migration in irradiated discs, focusing particularly on\nthose around M stars. In this first paper, we analyse the thermal structure of\ndiscs that are irradiated by an M star by solving the radiative transfer\nequation by means of a Monte Carlo code. Our simulations of irradiated\nhydrostatic discs are realistic and self-consistent in that they include dust\nsettling with multiple grain sizes (N=15), the gravitational force of an\nembedded planet on the disc, and the presence of a dead zone (a region with\nvery low levels of turbulence) within it. We show that dust settling drives the\ntemperature of the mid-plane from an $r^{-3/5}$ distribution (well mixed dust\nmodels) toward an $r^{-3/4}$. The dead zone, meanwhile, leaves a dusty wall at\nits outer edge because dust settling in this region is enhanced compared to the\nactive turbulent disc at larger disc radii. The disc heating produced by this\nirradiated wall provides a positive gradient region of the temperature in the\ndead zone in front of the wall. This is crucially important for slowing\nplanetary migration because Lindblad torques are inversely proportional to the\ndisc temperature. Furthermore, we show that low turbulence of the dead zone is\nself-consistently induced by dust settling, resulting in the Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability (KHI). We show that the strength of turbulence arising from the KHI\nin the dead zone is $\\alpha=10^{-5}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2009 16:08:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

This rapid rotation leads to\nan oblate stellar figure. It also induces the photosphere to be hotter (by up\nto several thousand Kelvin) at the pole than at the equator as a result of a\nprocess called gravity darkening that was first predicted by von Zeipel (1924).\nTransits of extrasolar planets across such a non-uniform, oblate disk yield\nunusual and distinctive lightcurves that can be used to determine the relative\nalignment of the stellar rotation pole and the planet orbit normal. This\nspin-orbit alignment can be used to constrain models of planet formation and\nevolution. Orderly planet formation and migration within a disk that is\ncoplanar with the stellar equator will result in spin-orbit alignment. More\nviolent planet-planet scattering events should yield spin-orbit misaligned\nplanets. Rossiter-McLaughlin measurements of transits of lower-mass stars show\nthat some planets are spin-orbit aligned, and some are not.

The LogicBlox language enhances\nDatalog in a variety of ways, including constraints and meta-programming, as\nwell as support for programmer defined constraints which on the meta-model\nitself ? meta-constraints ? which act to restrict the set of allowable\nprograms. LBTrust utilizes LogicBlox?s meta-programming and meta-constraints to\nenable customizable cryptographic, partitioning and distribution strategies\nbased on the execution environment. We present uses cases of LBTrust based on\nthree trust management systems (Binder, D1LP, and Secure Network Datalog), and\nprovide a preliminary evaluation of a Binder-based trust management system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2009 18:05:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-15"}

This decreases I/O and increases cache utility.\nHowever, such batch processing can increase query response time by starving\ninteractive workloads. LifeRaft addresses starvation using techniques inspired\nby head scheduling in disk drives. Depending upon the workload saturation and\nqueuing times, the system adaptively and incrementally trades-off processing\nqueries in arrival order and data-driven batch processing.

Attempts to address this problem face a fundamental dilemma.\nDatabase querying is based on the logic of predicate evaluation, with a\nprecisely defined answer set for a given query. On the other hand, in an\ninformation retrieval approach, ranked query results have long been accepted as\nfar superior to results based on boolean query evaluation. As a consequence,\nwhen keyword queries are attempted against databases, relatively ad-hoc ranking\nmechanisms are invented (if ranking is used at all), and there is little\nleverage from the large body of IR literature regarding how to rank query\nresults.\n  Our proposal is to create a clear separation between ranking and database\nquerying. This divides the problem into two parts, and allows us to address\nthese separately. The first task is to represent the database, conceptually, as\na collection of independent ``queried units'', or ``qunits'', each of which\nrepresents the desired result for some query against the database. The second\ntask is to evaluate keyword queries against a collection of qunits, which can\nbe treated as independent documents for query purposes, thereby permitting the\nuse of standard IR techniques.

Both economical and environmental\nfactors now require that DBMSs pay close attention to energy consumption. In\nthis paper we approach this issue by considering energy consumption as a\nfirst-class performance goal for query processing in a DBMS. We present two\nconcrete techniques that can be used by a DBMS to directly manage the energy\nconsumption. Both techniques trade energy consumption for performance. The\nfirst technique, called PVC, leverages the ability of modern processors to\nexecute at lower processor voltage and frequency. The second technique, called\nQED, uses query aggregation to leverage common components of queries in a\nworkload. Using experiments run on a commercial DBMS and MySQL, we show that\nPVC can reduce the processor energy consumption by 49% of the original\nconsumption while increasing the response time by only 3%. On MySQL, PVC can\nreduce energy consumption by 20% with a response time penalty of only 6%. For\nsimple selection queries with no predicate overlap, we show that QED can be\nused to gracefully trade response time for energy, reducing energy consumption\nby 54% for a 43% increase in average response time.

A\nTransactional Component (TC) works at a logical level only: it knows about\ntransactions and their \"logical\" concurrency control and undo/redo recovery,\nbut it does not know about page layout, B-trees etc. A Data Component (DC)\nknows about the physical storage structure. It supports a record oriented\ninterface that provides atomic operations, but it does not know about\ntransactions. Providing atomic record operations may itself involve DC-local\nconcurrency control and recovery, which can be implemented using system\ntransactions. The interaction of the mechanisms in TC and DC leads to\nmulti-level redo (unlike the repeat history paradigm for redo in integrated\nengines). This refactoring of the system architecture could allow easier\ndeployment of application-specific physical structures and may also be helpful\nto exploit multi-core hardware.

New storage systems are\nvital to the database community, as they are at the heart of making database\nsystems perform well in new application domains. Unfortunately, each such\nsystem also represents a substantial engineering effort including a great deal\nof duplication of mechanisms for features such as transactions and caching. In\nthis paper, we make the case for RodentStore, an adaptive and declarative\nstorage system providing a high-level interface for describing the physical\nrepresentation of data. Specifically, RodentStore uses a declarative storage\nalgebra whereby administrators (or database design tools) specify how a logical\nschema should be grouped into collections of rows, columns, and/or arrays, and\nthe order in which those groups should be laid out on disk. We describe the key\noperators and types of our algebra, outline the general architecture of\nRodentStore, which interprets algebraic expressions to generate a physical\nrepresentation of the data, and describe the interface between RodentStore and\nother parts of a database system, such as the query optimizer and executor. We\nprovide a case study of the potential use of RodentStore in representing dense\ngeospatial data collected from a mobile sensor network, showing the ease with\nwhich different storage layouts can be expressed using some of our algebraic\nconstructs and the potential performance gains that a RodentStore-built storage\nsystem can offer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2009 18:10:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-15"}

The characteristics of the emitted gravitational wave signal are\ndeduced from a Taylor expansion of a Newtonian quadrupolar emission model, and\nthe changes in signal structure as visible to the LISA mission are determined.\nWe show that short term variations can significantly change the higher order\nterms in the expansion, and thus lead to spurious (non) detection of frequency\nderivatives. This may hamper the estimation of the parameters of the system, in\nparticular their masses and distances. However, we find that overall detection\nis still secured as signals still can be described by general templates. We\nconclude that a better modelling of the effects of short term variations is\nneeded to prepare the community for astrophysical evaluations of real\ngravitational wave data of AM CVn systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2009 18:54:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

In gossip algorithms, nodes in the network randomly\ncommunicate with their neighbors and exchange information iteratively. The\nalgorithms are simple and decentralized, making them attractive for wireless\nnetwork applications. In general, gossip algorithms are robust to unreliable\nwireless conditions and time varying network topologies. In this paper we\nintroduce GGE and demonstrate that greedy updates lead to rapid convergence. We\ndo not require nodes to have any location information. Instead, greedy updates\nare made possible by exploiting the broadcast nature of wireless\ncommunications. During the operation of GGE, when a node decides to gossip,\ninstead of choosing one of its neighbors at random, it makes a greedy\nselection, choosing the node which has the value most different from its own.\nIn order to make this selection, nodes need to know their neighbors' values.\nTherefore, we assume that all transmissions are wireless broadcasts and nodes\nkeep track of their neighbors' values by eavesdropping on their communications.\nWe show that the convergence of GGE is guaranteed for connected network\ntopologies. We also study the rates of convergence and illustrate, through\ntheoretical bounds and numerical simulations, that GGE consistently outperforms\nrandomized gossip and performs comparably to geographic gossip on\nmoderate-sized random geometric graph topologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2009 21:04:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

In the past, several alternatives to the Higgs mechanism for\nmass generation have been proposed to avoid the postulation of the Higgs field.\nThis article proposes yet another one. This alternative is distinctly different\nfrom the others because it considers mass generation through internal\ninteractions of a particle rather than interactions with external fields. This\nrequires particles to have an internal structure beyond intrinsic spin. A\ncomplete field theory of such composite particles is seen to be possible. Of\ncourse, if Higgs bosons are observed by experiment, there will be no need for\nany alternatives.

Recent Swift observations suggest that these GRBs may\nbe related to catastrophic explosions in degenerate compact stars, denoted as\n\"Type I\" GRBs. The most popular models include the merger of two compact\nstellar objects (NS-NS or NS-BH). We utilize a Monte Carlo approach to\ndetermine whether a merger progenitor model can self-consistently account for\nall the observations of short-hard GRBs, including a sample with redshift\nmeasurements in the Swift era (z-known sample) and the CGRO/BATSE sample. We\napply various merger time delay distributions invoked in compact star merger\nmodels to derive the redshift distributions of these Type I GRBs, and then\nconstrain the unknown luminosity function of Type I GRBs using the observed\nluminosity-redshift (L - z) distributions of the z-known sample. The best\nluminosity function model, together with the adopted merger delay model, are\nthen applied to confront the peak flux distribution (log N - log P\ndistribution) of the BATSE and Swift samples. We find that for all the merger\nmodels invoking a range of merger delay time scales (including those invoking a\nlarge fraction of \"prompt mergers\"), it is difficult to reconcile the models\nwith all the data. The data are instead statistically consistent with the\nfollowing two possible scenarios. First, that short/hard GRBs are a\nsuperposition of compact-star-merger origin (Type I) GRBs and a population of\nGRBs that track the star formation history, which are probably related to the\ndeaths of massive stars (Type II GRBs). Sec- ond, the entire short/hard GRB\npopulation is consistent with a typical delay of 2 Gyr with respect to the star\nformation history with modest scatter. This may point towards a different Type\nI progenitor than the traditional compact star merger models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2009 23:53:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 20 Nov 2010 02:02:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-20"}

Dynamic cool coronal structures, on the other hand, are\noften observed to propagate along coronal loops. In this paper, we report on\nthe discovery of two types of dynamic cool coronal structures, and characterize\ntheir fundamental properties. Using the EUV 304 angstrom images from the\nExtreme UltraViolet Imager (EUVI) telescope on the Solar TErrestrial RElation\nObservatory (STEREO) and the Ca II filtergrams from the Solar Optical Telescope\n(SOT) instrument on HINODE, we study the evolution of an EUV arch and the\nkinematics of cool coronal structures. The EUV 304 angstrom observations show\nthat a missile-like plasmoid moves along an arch-shaped trajectory, with an\naverage velocity of 31 km/s. About three hours later, a plasma arch forms along\nthe trajectory, subsequently the top part of the arch fades away and\ndisappears, meanwhile the plasma belonging to the two legs of the arch flows\ndownward to the arch feet. During the arch formation and disappearance, SOT Ca\nII images explore dynamic cool coronal structures beneath the arch. By tracking\nthese structures, we classify them into two types. Type I is threadlike in\nshape and flows downward with a greater average velocity of 72 km/s, finally it\ncombines a loop fibril at chromospheric altitude. Type II is\nshape-transformable and sometimes rolling as it flows downward with a smaller\nvelocity of 37 km/s, then disappears insularly in the chromosphere. It is\nsuggested that the two types of structures are possibly controlled by different\nmagnetic configurations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2009 03:15:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

We clarify that multi-band effects inevitably caused by the optical\nlattices generate a rich structure, when the systems crossover from the region\nof weakly bound molecular bosons to the region of strongly bound atomic bosons.\nHere the crossover can be controlled by attractive fermion interaction. One of\nthe present models is a case with attractive fermion interaction, where an\ninsulator-superfluid transition takes place. The transition is characterized as\nthe transition between a band insulator and a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC)\nsuperfluid state. Differing from the conventional BCS superfluid transition,\nthis transition shows unconventional properties. In contrast to the one\nparticle excitation gap scaled by the superfluid order parameter in the\nconventional BCS transition, because of the multi-band effects, a large gap of\none-particle density of states is retained all through the transition although\nthe superfluid order grows continuously from zero. A reentrant transition with\nlowering temperature is another unconventionality. The other model is the case\nwith coexisting attractive and repulsive interactions. Within a mean field\ntreatment, we find a new insulating state, an orbital ordered insulator. This\ninsulator is one candidate for the Mott insulator of molecular bosons and is\nthe first example that the orbital internal degrees of freedom of molecular\nbosons appears explicitly.

A basic assumption of this\nwork is that giant planet migration occurred after the completion of\nterrestrial planet formation, such as in the models that link the former to the\norigin of the Late Heavy Bombardment. The divergent migration of Jupiter and\nSaturn causes the g5 eigenfrequency to cross resonances of the form g5=gk with\nk ranging from 1 to 4. Consequently these secular resonances cause\nlarge-amplitude responses in the eccentricities of the terrestrial planets. We\nshow that the resonances g5=g_4 and g5=g3 do not pose a problem if Jupiter and\nSaturn have a fast approach and departure from their mutual 2:1 mean motion\nresonance. On the other hand, the resonance crossings g5=g2 and g5=g1 are more\nof a concern as they tend to yield a terrestrial system incompatible with the\ncurrent one. We offer two solutions to this problem. The first uses the fact\nthat a secular resonance crossing can also damp the amplitude of a Fourier mode\nif the latter is large originally. A second scenario involves a 'jumping\nJupiter' in which encounters between an ice giant and Jupiter, without ejection\nof the former, cause the latter to migrate away from Saturn much faster than if\nmigration is driven solely by encounters with planetesimals. In this case, the\ng5=g2 and g5=g1 resonances can be jumped over, or occur very briefly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2009 08:38:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

In a similar\nfashion, it is proved that the famous Lorenz--1963 model violates the\nstructural properties of the Saltzman equations and hence cannot be considered\nas the maximum simplification of the Rayleigh--B\\'{e}nard convection problem.\nUsing a six-component truncation, we show that it is again possible retaining\nboth symmetries and the Nambu representation in the course of discretization.\nThe conservative part of this six-component reduction is related to the\nLagrange top equations. Dissipation is incorporated using a metric tensor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2009 14:15:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2009 12:21:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 25 Jun 2010 08:55:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-28"}

The second set (type B) of starbursts\nis characterized by long quiescence periods given by the sum of the dynamical\nand the dissipative timescale: after a first burst, the inserted energy leads\nto a substantial expansion of the system, by this stopping any significant star\nformation activity. A next burst might occur, when the gas reaches high\ndensities again, i.e. after the gas recollapsed and the energy injected by\nstellar feedback is dissipated.\n  In case of a diffuse ISM model, type A bursts are the most common type due to\nthe high efficiency of radiative cooling (no type B bursts are found).

Our Scanning Tunneling\nMicroscopy experiments show that this unconventional response of the system to\nshort electric pulses arises from a nanometer scale Electronic Phase Separation\n(EPS) generated in the bulk material.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2009 15:35:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-11"}

In addition to the Lorentz force that is parallel to the\nelectric field, we find that the transverse force perpendicular to the applied\nelectric field may not vanish in a system with an anisotropic energy\ndispersion. Surprisingly, in contrast to the previous results, the transverse\nforce generated by the electric field does not depend on the spin current, but\nin general, it is related to the second derivative of energy dispersion only.\nFurthermore, we find that the transverse force does not vanish in the\nRashba-Dresselhaus system. Therefore, the non-vanishing transverse force acts\nas a driving force and results in charge imbalance at the edges of the sample.\nThe estimated ratio of the Hall voltage to the longitudinal voltage is $\\sim\n10^{-3}$. The disorder effect is also considered in the study of the\nRashba-Dresselhaus system. We find that the transverse force vanishes in the\npresence of impurities in this system because the vertex correction and the\nanomalous velocity of the electron accidently cancel each other.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2009 15:38:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}
