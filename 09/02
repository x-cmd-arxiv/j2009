The latter component, never observed in non-accreting stars,\ncould be plasma heated by the shock formed by the accretion process. However\nits nature is still being debated. Our aim is to probe the soft X-ray emission\nfrom the high-density plasma component in classical T Tauri stars to check\nwhether this is plasma heated in the accretion shock or whether it is coronal\nplasma.

Other\nconfinement situations are also studied analytically and several relations\nbetween, the two HS in a spherical pore, two sticked HS in a spherical pore,\nand two HS on a spherical surface partition functions are traced. These\nrelations make meaningful the limiting caging and low density behavior. Turning\nto the system of two HS in a spherical pore, we also analytically evaluate the\npressure tensor.

However, thermal conduction along\nmagnetic field lines fundamentally changes the stability of the ICM, leading to\nthe \"heat-flux buoyancy instability\" when $dT/dr>0$ and the \"magnetothermal\ninstability\" when $dT/dr<0$. The ICM is thus buoyantly unstable regardless of\nthe signs of $dT/dr$ and $ds/dr$. On the other hand, these\ntemperature-gradient-driven instabilities saturate by reorienting the magnetic\nfield (perpendicular to $\\hat{\\bf r}$ when $dT/dr>0$ and parallel to $\\hat{\\bf\nr}$ when $dT/dr<0$), without generating sustained convection. We show that\nafter an anisotropically conducting plasma reaches this nonlinearly stable\nmagnetic configuration, it experiences a buoyant restoring force that resists\nfurther distortions of the magnetic field. This restoring force is analogous to\nthe buoyant restoring force experienced by a stably stratified adiabatic\nplasma. We argue that in order for a driving mechanism (e.g, galaxy motions or\ncosmic-ray buoyancy) to overcome this restoring force and generate turbulence\nin the ICM, the strength of the driving must exceed a threshold, corresponding\nto turbulent velocities $\\gtrsim 10 -100 {km/s}$. For weaker driving, the ICM\nremains in its nonlinearly stable magnetic configuration, and turbulent mixing\nis effectively absent. We discuss the implications of these findings for the\nturbulent diffusion of metals and heat in the ICM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2009 22:12:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The interaction occurs at distances ~10^11-10^13 cm\nand shocks the impacting supernova debris, dissipating kinetic energy and\nre-heating the gas. Initially, some radiation may escape promptly through the\nevacuated region of the shadowcone, producing a bright X-ray (0.1-2 keV) burst\nlasting minutes to hours with luminosity L ~ 10^44 ergs/s.

These signatures are\nprominent for viewing angles looking down upon the shocked region, or about 10%\nof the time. The properties of the emission provide a straightforward measure\nof the separation distance between the stars and hence (assuming Roche lobe\noverflow) the companion's radius.

A precise\nknowledge of the host stars is necessary to derive the planetary properties\naccurately. The properties of the host stars, especially their chemical\ncomposition, are also of interest in their own right. Information about planet\nformation is inferred by, among others, correlations between different\nparameters such as the orbital period and the metallicity of the host stars.\nThe stellar properties studied should be derived as homogeneously as possible.\nThe present work provides new, uniformly derived parameters for 13 host stars\nof transiting planets. Effective temperature, surface gravity, microturbulence\nparameter, and iron abundance were derived from spectra of both high\nsignal-to-noise ratio and high resolution by assuming iron excitation and\nionization equilibria. For some stars, the new parameters differ from previous\ndeterminations, which is indicative of changes in the planetary radii. A\nsystematic offset in the abundance scale with respect to previous assessments\nis found for the TrES and HAT objects. Our abundance measurements are\nremarkably robust in terms of the uncertainties in surface gravities. The iron\nabundances measured in the present work are supplemented by all previous\ndeterminations using the same analysis technique. The distribution of iron\nabundance then agrees well with the known metal-rich distribution of planet\nhost stars. To facilitate future studies, the spectroscopic results of the\ncurrent work are supplemented by the findings for other host stars of\ntransiting planets, for a total dataset of 50 objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2009 13:17:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

A method based on\nwavelet analysis is proposed and tested to reduce this noise. The method, known\nas wavelet based density estimation (WBDE), was previously introduced in the\nstatistical literature to estimate probability densities given a finite number\nof independent measurements. Its novel application to plasma simulations can be\nviewed as a natural extension of the finite size particles (FSP) approach, with\nthe advantage of estimating more accurately distribution functions that have\nlocalized sharp features. The proposed method preserves the moments of the\nparticle distribution function to a good level of accuracy, has no constraints\non the dimensionality of the system, does not require an a priori selection of\na global smoothing scale, and its able to adapt locally to the smoothness of\nthe density based on the given discrete particle data. Most importantly, the\ncomputational cost of the denoising stage is of the same order as one time step\nof a FSP simulation.

In order to set up a\nstraw-man ultra-compact object with no event horizon, but which is otherwise\nalmost identical to a black hole, we consider a nonrotating thin-shell model\ninspired by Mazur and Mottola's gravastar, which has a Schwarzschild exterior,\na de Sitter interior and an infinitely thin shell with finite tension\nseparating the two regions. As viewed from the external space-time, the shell\ncan be located arbitrarily close to the Schwarzschild radius, so a gravastar\nmight seem indistinguishable from a black hole when tests are only performed on\nits external metric. We study the linearized dynamics of the system, and in\nparticular the junction conditions connecting internal and external\ngravitational perturbations. As a first application of the formalism we compute\npolar and axial oscillation modes of a thin-shell gravastar. We show that the\nquasinormal mode spectrum is completely different from that of a black hole,\neven in the limit when the surface redshift becomes infinite. Polar QNMs depend\non the equation of state of matter on the shell and can be used to distinguish\nbetween different gravastar models.

The\nbasic idea is to interpret the free oscillations of a black hole in the eikonal\nlimit in terms of null particles trapped at the unstable circular orbit and\nslowly leaking out. The real part of the complex quasinormal resonances is\nrelated to the angular velocity at the unstable null geodesic. The imaginary\npart of the resonances is related to the instability timescale (or the inverse\nLyapunov exponent) of the orbit. While this geometric-optics description of the\nblack-hole quasinormal resonances in terms of perturbed null {\\it rays} is very\nappealing and intuitive, it is still highly important to verify the validity of\nthis approach by directly analyzing the Teukolsky wave equation which governs\nthe dynamics of perturbation {\\it waves} in the black-hole spacetime. This is\nthe main goal of the present paper. We first use the geometric-optics technique\nof perturbing a bundle of unstable null rays to calculate the resonances of\nnear-extremal Kerr black holes in the eikonal approximation. We then directly\nsolve the Teukolsky wave equation (supplemented by the appropriate physical\nboundary conditions) and show that the resultant quasinormal spectrum obtained\ndirectly from the wave analysis is in accord with the spectrum obtained from\nthe geometric-optics approximation of perturbed null rays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2009 04:30:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-25"}

The system is initially destabilized by a magnetically buoyant flux\ntube pointing in the cross-stream direction. The shear amplifies the initial\nfield to Lundquist numbers of about 200-400, but then its value drops to about\n100-300, depending on the value of the sub-adiabatic gradient. The larger\nvalues correspond to cases where the stratification is strongly stable and\nnearly isothermal. At the end of the runs the magnetic field is nearly\naxisymmetric, i.e. uniform in the streamwise direction. In view of Cowling's\ntheorem the sustainment of the field remains a puzzle and may be due to subtle\nnumerical effects that have not yet been identified in detail. In the final\nstate the strength of the magnetic field decreases with height in such a way\nthat the field is expected to be unstable. Low amplitude oscillations are seen\nin the vertical velocity even at late times, suggesting that they might be\npersistent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2009 06:01:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

The derived H_2\ncolumn density, 2.6x10^25 cm^-2, corresponds to a visual extinction of\nA_v~15000 mag., and the derived number density is at least two orders of\nmagnitude higher than for the other OMC-2/3 continuum sources. The volume\ndensity profile of the source was estimated to have a power-law index of 2 or\nsteeper down to a radius of ~450 AU. The time scale to form a protostar at the\ncenter or the time scale elapsed after its formation is estimated to be 830 to\n7600 yr. This is much shorter than the typical lifetime of the Class 0/I\nprotostars, which is ~10^(4-5) yr, suggesting that MMS 6-main is probably in\neither the earliest stage of the proto-stellar core or in the latest stage of\nthe pre-stellar phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2009 08:14:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

In\nthese techniques, the full FOV image has to be reconstructed from the resulting\nacquired undersampled k-space data. To this end, several reconstruction\ntechniques have been proposed such as the widely-used SENSE method. However,\nthe reconstructed image generally presents artifacts when perturbations occur\nin both the measured data and the estimated coil sensitivity maps. In this\npaper, we aim at achieving good reconstructed image quality when using low\nmagnetic field and high reduction factor. Under these severe experimental\nconditions, neither the SENSE method nor the Tikhonov regularization in the\nimage domain give convincing results. To this aim, we present a novel method\nfor SENSE-based reconstruction which proceeds with regularization in the\ncomplex wavelet domain. To further enhance the reconstructed image quality,\nlocal convex constraints are added in the regularization process.

We limit our attention to the\nlinearised MHD formulation of the electromagnetic back-reaction characterising\nthe equilibrium, by fixing the structure of the radial, vertical and azimuthal\nprofiles. Since we deal with toroidal currents only, the consistency of the\nmodel is ensured by the presence of a small collisional effect,\nphenomenologically described by a non-zero constant Nernst coefficient (thermal\npower of the plasma). Such an effect provides a proper balance of the electron\nforce equation via non zero temperature gradients, related directly to the\nradial and vertical velocity components.\n  We show that the obtained profile has the typical oscillating feature of the\ncrystalline structure, reconciled with the presence of viscosity, associated to\nthe differential rotation of the disk, and with a net accretion rate. In fact,\nwe provide a direct relation between the electromagnetic reaction of the disk\nand the (no longer zero) increasing of its mass per unit time. The radial\naccretion component of the velocity results to be few orders of magnitude below\nthe equatorial sound velocity. Its oscillating-like character does not allow a\nreal matter in-fall to the central object (an effect to be searched into\nnon-linear MHD corrections), but it accounts for the out-coming of steady\nfluxes, favourable to the ring-like morphology of the disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2009 10:11:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

The CO J =1-0\ndataset is from the second NANTEN CO survey and the HI dataset is from the\nmerged Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) and Parkes Telescope surveys.\nThe major findings of our analysis are: 1) GMCs are associated with an envelope\nof HI emission, 2) in GMCs [average CO intensity] is proportional to [average\nHI intensity]^[1.1+-0.1] and 3) the HI intensity tends to increase with the\nstar formation activity within GMCs, from Type I to Type III. An analysis of\nthe HI envelopes associated with GMCs shows that their average linewidth is 14\nkm s-1 and the mean density in the envelope is 10 cm-3. We argue that the HI\nenvelopes are gravitationally bound by GMCs. These findings are consistent with\na continual increase in the mass of GMCs via HI accretion at an accretion rate\nof 0.05 Msun/yr over a time scale of 10 Myr. The growth of GMCs is terminated\nvia dissipative ionization and/or stellar-wind disruption in the final stage of\nGMC evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2009 11:03:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

These discoveries stem from the first year data of the\nPan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey (PAndAS), a photometric survey of the\nM31/M33 group conducted with the Megaprime/MegaCam wide-field camera mounted on\nthe Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. Both satellites appear as spatial\noverdensities of stars which, when plotted in a color-magnitude diagram, follow\nmetal-poor, [Fe/H]=-1.8, red giant branches at the distance of M31/M33.\nAndromeda XXI is a moderately bright dwarf galaxy (M_V=-9.9+/-0.6), albeit with\nlow surface brightness, emphasizing again that many relatively luminous M31\nsatellites still remain to be discovered. It is also a large satellite, with a\nhalf-light radius close to 1 kpc, making it the fourth largest Local Group\ndwarf spheroidal galaxy after the recently discovered Andromeda XIX, Andromeda\nII and Sagittarius around the Milky Way, and supports the trend that M31\nsatellites are larger than their Milky Way counterparts. Andromeda XXII is much\nfainter (M_V=-6.5+/-0.8) and lies a lot closer in projection to M33 than it\ndoes to M31 (42 vs. 224 kpc), suggesting that it could be the first Triangulum\nsatellite to be discovered.

In this paper, we combine different norms\nincluding $L_1$ to form an intelligent penalty in order to add side information\nto the fitting of a regression or classification model to obtain reasonable\nestimates.

CAP penalties are built by defining groups and\ncombining the properties of norm penalties at the across-group and within-group\nlevels. Grouped selection occurs for nonoverlapping groups. Hierarchical\nvariable selection is reached by defining groups with particular overlapping\npatterns. We propose using the BLASSO and cross-validation to compute CAP\nestimates in general.

This is used to passively mode-lock an Erbium-doped fibre laser\nworking at 1559nm, with a 5.24nm spectral bandwidth and ~460fs pulse duration,\npaving the way to graphene-based photonics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2009 15:20:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-03"}

In this paper, we\npresent the results of search for compact nebulae (reminiscent of circumstellar\nnebulae around evolved massive stars) using archival 24 $\\mu$m data obtained\nwith the Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer. We discovered 115 nebulae,\nmost of which bear a striking resemblance to the circumstellar nebulae\nassociated with Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs) and late WN-type (WNL)\nWolf-Rayet (WR) stars in the Milky Way and the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We\ninterpret this similarity as an indication that the central stars of detected\nnebulae are either LBVs or related evolved massive stars. Our interpretation is\nsupported by follow-up spectroscopy of two dozens of these central stars, most\nof which turns out to be either candidate LBVs (cLBVs), blue supergiants or WNL\nstars. We expect that the forthcoming spectroscopy of the remaining objects\nfrom our list, accompanied by the spectrophotometric monitoring of the already\ndiscovered cLBVs, will further increase the known population of Galactic LBVs,\nwhich in turn would have profound consequences for better understanding the LBV\nphenomenon and its role in the transition between hydrogen burning O stars and\nhelium burning WR stars. We also report the detection of an arc-like structure\nattached to the cLBV HD326823 and an arc associated with the LBV R99 (HD269445)\nin the LMC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2009 15:23:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2010 17:55:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2010 19:29:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The heat capacity data on\nPauli-paramagnetic LaRhB and LaRhC indicate a high frequency vibrating motion\nof boron and carbon atoms in the unit cell.

Compounds with other rare earths order ferromagnetically at low\ntemperatures except TmRhB in which the zero field evolution of magnetic\ninteractions is relatively more complicated. The electrical resistivity of\nGdRhB decreases with increasing temperature in the paramagnetic state in the\nvicinity of T, which is rarely seen in ferromagnets.
