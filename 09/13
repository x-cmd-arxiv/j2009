The results of each Evolutionary Algorithm are shown based on the\nsimulations. Moreover, the results are also compared by using different\nparameters (the degree of parallelism and the number of processors) in the\nsimulation to give an overview of the advantages and the disadvantages of the\nalgorithms in terms of computation time and resource usage.

Our tomographic imaging\ntechnique applied to time series of rotationally modulated circularly polarized\nprofiles reveals an axisymmetric large-scale poloidal magnetic field on the M4\ndwarf. We then apply a synthetic spectrum fitting technique for measuring the\naverage magnetic flux on the star. The flux measured in G 164-31 is Bf =\n3.2+-0.4 kG, which is significantly greater than the average value of 0.68 kG\ndetermined from the imaging technique. The difference indicates that a\nsignificant fraction of the stellar magnetic energy is stored in small-scale\nstructures at the surface of G 164-31. Our H_alpha emission light curve shows\nevidence for rotational modulation suggesting the presence of localized\nstructure in the chromosphere of this M dwarf. The radius of the M4 dwarf\nderived from the rotational period and the projected equatorial velocity is at\nleast 30% larger than that predicted from theoretical models. We argue that\nthis discrepancy is likely primarily due to the young nature of G 164-31 rather\nthan primarily due to magnetic field effects, indicating that age is an\nimportant factor which should be considered in the interpretation of this\nobservational result.

A framework is a maximal set of\nproperties of a system for which probabilities can be consistently defined.\nThis notion is expressed by saying that a framework provides an exhaustive set\nof exclusive alternatives (ESEA), but no single framework suffices to fully\ncharacterize a quantum system. Indeed, the existence of multiple incompatible\nframeworks is the hallmark of quantum mechanical behavior.

Features are extracted by\nusing different techniques to optimize the performance of the identification.\nAccording to the VALID speech database, the highest speaker identification rate\nof 100.000 percent for studio environment and 82.33 percent for office\nenvironmental conditions have been achieved in the close set text dependent\nspeaker identification system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Sep 2009 20:36:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-15"}

The\ntheoretical model is the `birth and immigration' population process. The first\nthree distributions above can be considered special cases of the NBD. In\nparticular, a point branching process along the magnitude (or log seismic\nmoment) axis with independent events (immigrants) explains the\nmagnitude/moment-frequency relation and the NBD of earthquake counts in large\ntime/space windows, as well as the dependence of the NBD parameters on the\nmagnitude threshold (magnitude of an earthquake catalog completeness). We\ndiscuss applying these distributions, especially the NBD, to approximate event\nnumbers in earthquake catalogs. There are many different representations of the\nNBD. Most can be traced either to the Pascal distribution or to the mixture of\nthe Poisson distribution with the gamma law. We discuss advantages and\ndrawbacks of both representations for statistical analysis of earthquake\ncatalogs.

Therefore, a total of ~12-14 helium-related photons are emitted\nduring cosmological recombination. This is an important addition to\ncosmological recombination spectrum which in the future may render it slightly\neasier to determine the primordial abundance of helium using differential\nmeasurements of the CMB energy spectrum. Also, since these photons are the only\nwitnesses of the feedback process at high redshift, observing them in principle\noffers a way to check our understanding of the recombination physics. Here most\ninterestingly, the feedback of HeII photons on HeI leads to the appearance of\nseveral additional, rather narrow spectral features in the HeI recombination\nspectrum at low frequencies. Consequently, the signatures of helium-related\nfeatures in the CMB spectral distortion due to cosmological recombination at\nsome given frequency can exceed the average level of ~17% several times. We\nfind that in particular the bands around nu ~10GHz, ~35GHz, ~80GHz, and ~200GHz\nseem to be affected strongly. In addition, we computed the changes in the\ncosmological ionization history, finding that only the feedback of primary HeI\nphotons on the dynamics of HeII-->HeI recombination has an effect, producing a\nchange of DN_e/N_e ~+ 0.17% at z~2300.
