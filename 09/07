We also compare the global Compton\nscattering model with local models in spherical and slab geometry. We find that\nthe slab model approximates the global model significantly better than the\nspherical one. Still, neither local model gives a good approximation to the\nradial profile of the cooling rate, and the differences can be up to two orders\nof magnitude. The local slab model underestimates the cooling rate at outer\nregions whereas it overestimates that rate at inner regions.

Dark energy contributes today in the amount of about 73 % to the total\nenergy content of the universe, and its spatial distribution is compatible with\nperfect uniformity. The simplest possible explanation for dark energy is to\nassume that it is just a universal constant, the so called cosmological\nconstant.

The topology of the vortex array\ncrucially determines the flow response of this system. To illustrate this\nclaim, two limiting cases are considered: weak and strong pinning interactions.\nIn the first case disorder is strong enough to introduce plastic effects in the\nvortex lattice. Diffraction patterns unveil polycrystalline lattice topology\nwith dislocations and grain boundaries determining the electromagnetic response\nof the system. Filamentary flow is found to arise as a consequence of\ndislocation dynamics. We analize the stability of vortex lattices against the\nformation of grain boundaries, as well as the steady state dynamics for\ncurrents approaching the depinning critical current from above, when vortex\nmotion is mainly localized at the grain boundaries. On the contrary, a\ndislocation description proves no longer adequate in the second limiting case\nexamined. For strong pinning interactions, the vortex array appears completely\namorphous and no remnant of the Abrikosov lattice order is left. Here we obtain\nthe critical current as a function of impurity density, its scaling properties,\nand characterize the steady state dynamics above depinning. The plastic\ndepinning observed in the amorphous phase is tightly connected with the\nemergence of channel-like flow.

We study the computational complexity of model checking\ncomputation tree logic (CTL) over OCPs. A PSPACE upper bound is inherited from\nthe modal mu-calculus for this problem. First, we analyze the periodic\nbehaviour of CTL over OCPs and derive a model checking algorithm whose running\ntime is exponential only in the number of control locations and a syntactic\nnotion of the formula that we call leftward until depth. Thus, model checking\nfixed OCPs against CTL formulas with a fixed leftward until depth is in P. This\ngeneralizes a result of the first author, Mayr, and To for the expression\ncomplexity of CTL's fragment EF. Second, we prove that already over some fixed\nOCP, CTL model checking is PSPACE-hard. Third, we show that there already\nexists a fixed CTL formula for which model checking of OCPs is PSPACE-hard. To\nobtain the latter result, we employ two results from complexity theory: (i)\nConverting a natural number in Chinese remainder presentation into binary\npresentation is in logspace-uniform NC^1 and (ii) PSPACE is AC^0-serializable.\nWe demonstrate that our approach can be used to obtain further results.

The mass-radius\nrelation of stars described by these equations of state are determined.

Due to larger fraction of H_2 and HD molecules, its prestellar\nthermal evolution is considerably different from that in the first star\nformation. Reflecting the difference, two hydrostatic cores appear in a nested\nmanner: a protostar is enclosed by a transient hydrostatic core, which appears\nduring the prestellar collapse. If the initial natal core rotates fast at a\nrate with rotational to gravitational energy ratio \\beta_0 > 0.01-0.1, the\ntransient hydrostatic core fragments to \\sim 10 M_\\odot sub-cores at density\n\\sim 10^9 cm^-3. With smaller rotation energy, fragmentation occurs at higher\ndensity while a single protostar forms without fragmentation if rotation is\nextremely slow with \\beta_0 < 10^-6 -10^-5. If magnetic field is present, these\nthreshold values of \\beta_0 is boosted owing to angular momentum transport by\nthe magnetic breaking. Magnetic field also drives the protostellar outflows.\nWith strong magnetic field, two distinct outflows are observed: The slower one\nemanates from the transient hydrostatic core, while the faster one from the\nprotostar. These flows may affect the final stellar mass by ejecting some of\nmasses in the initial core, and also may play some role in driving and\nmaintenance of interstellar turbulence in young galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2009 04:23:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

Transient dynamics offers a sound formalism of the observed\nqualities of brain activity, while providing a rigorous set of analysis tools.\nTransients have two main features: First, they are resistant to noise, and\nreliable even in the face of small variations in initial conditions; the\nsequence of states visited by the system (its trajectory), is thus structurally\nstable. Second, the transients are input-specific, and thus convey information\nabout what caused them in the first place. This new dynamical view manifests a\nrigorous explanation of how perception, cognition, emotion, and other mental\nprocesses evolve as a sequence of activity patterns in the brain, and, most\nimportantly, how they interfere with each other. The ideas discussed and\ndemonstrated here lead to the creation of a quantitative theory of the human\nmental activity and can be deployed on artificial agents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2009 05:22:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-08"}

They need the ability to gain rapid and\nscalable access to high-end computing capabilities. Cloud computing promises to\ndeliver such a computing infrastructure using data centers so that HPC users\ncan access applications and data from a Cloud anywhere in the world on demand\nand pay based on what they use. However, the growing demand drastically\nincreases the energy consumption of data centers, which has become a critical\nissue. High energy consumption not only translates to high energy cost, which\nwill reduce the profit margin of Cloud providers, but also high carbon\nemissions which is not environmentally sustainable. Hence, energy-efficient\nsolutions are required that can address the high increase in the energy\nconsumption from the perspective of not only Cloud provider but also from the\nenvironment. To address this issue we propose near-optimal scheduling policies\nthat exploits heterogeneity across multiple data centers for a Cloud provider.\nWe consider a number of energy efficiency factors such as energy cost, carbon\nemission rate, workload, and CPU power efficiency which changes across\ndifferent data center depending on their location, architectural design, and\nmanagement system. Our carbon/energy based scheduling policies are able to\nachieve on average up to 30% of energy savings in comparison to profit based\nscheduling policies leading to higher profit and less carbon emissions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2009 06:13:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-08"}

In\nsuch a case, it is an interesting problem to find the necessary strength of\ninter-community interaction in order for the two communities to reach a\nconsensus. In this paper, the Information Accumulation System (IAS) model is\napplied to investigate the problem. With the application of the IAS model, the\nopinion dynamics of the two-community problem is found to belong to a wider\nclass of two-species problems appearing in population dynamics or in\ncompetition of two languages, for all of which the governing equations can be\ndescribed in terms of coupled logistic maps. Tipping diffusivity is defined as\nthe maximal inter-community interaction that the two communities can stay in\ndifferent opinions. For a problem with simple community structure and\nhomogeneous individuals, the tipping diffusivity is calculated theoretically.\nAs a conclusion of the paper, the convergence of the two communities to the\nsame value is less possible the more overall interaction, intra-community and\ninter-community, takes place. This implies, for example, that the increase in\nthe interaction between individuals caused by the development of modern\ncommunication tools, such as facebook and twitter, does not necessarily improve\nthe tendency towards global convergence between different communities. If the\nnumber of internal links increases by a factor, the number of inter-community\nlinks must be increased by an even higher factor, in order for consensus to be\nthe only stable attractor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2009 14:09:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2010 10:21:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 2010 07:53:14 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 9 May 2010 16:06:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-18"}

The IAC-star and IAC-pop codes and the MinnIAC suite have\nbeen used to obtain the star formation rate as a function of time, metallicity,\nand radius. We find that Phoenix has had ongoing but gradually decreasing star\nformation over nearly a Hubble time. The highest level of star formation\noccurred from the formation of the galaxy till 10.5 Gyr ago, when 50% of the\ntotal star formation had already taken place. From that moment, star formation\ncontinues at a significant level until 6 Gyr ago, and at a very low level till\nthe present time. The chemical enrichment law shows a trend of slowly\nincreasing metallicity as a function of time till 8--6 Gyr ago, when Z starts\nto increase steeply to the current value.\n  Young stars are found in the inner region of the galaxy only, but\nintermediate-age and old stars can be found at all galactocentric distances.\nThis study shows that star formation started at all galactocentric distances in\nPhoenix at an early epoch. Our results are compatible with a scenario in which\nthe star formation region envelope slowly shrinks as time goes on, possibly as\na natural result of pressure support reduction as gas supply diminishes.
