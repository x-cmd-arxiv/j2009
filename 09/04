Two-disk models match the data best, yielding a reduced chi^2 of ~1.2.\nOur two-disk model reproduces many of the asymmetries reported in the\nliterature and suggests that it is the secondary (tilted) disk which is largely\nresponsible for them. Our model suggests that the secondary disk is not\nconstrained to the inner regions of the system (extending out to at least 250\nAU) and that it has a slightly larger total area of dust than the primary, as a\nresult of slower fall-off of density with radius and height.

The disks overlap, but can coexist owing to their low optical depths and\ntherefore long mean collision times.

Applications range widely from comparative\ngene prediction to time-series analyses of micro-array data. The parameters of\nthe underlying models need to be adjusted for specific data sets, for example\nthe genome of a particular species, in order to maximize the prediction\naccuracy. Computationally efficient algorithms for parameter training are thus\nkey to maximizing the usability of a wide range of bioinformatics applications.\n  Results: We introduce two computationally efficient training algorithms, one\nfor Viterbi training and one for stochastic expectation maximization (EM)\ntraining, which render the memory requirements independent of the sequence\nlength. Unlike the existing algorithms for Viterbi and stochastic EM training\nwhich require a two-step procedure, our two new algorithms require only one\nstep and scan the input sequence in only one direction. We also implement these\ntwo new algorithms and the already published linear-memory algorithm for EM\ntraining into the hidden Markov model compiler HMM-Converter and examine their\nrespective practical merits for three small example models.\n  Conclusions: Bioinformatics applications employing hidden Markov models can\nuse the two algorithms in order to make Viterbi training and stochastic EM\ntraining more computationally efficient.

The bulge (or hard) sources have X-ray colors which are\nconsistent with Low Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXB) but the the disk sources have\nsofter colors suggesting a different type of source. In this paper, we further\nstudy the properties of hard and soft sources by constructing color segregated\nX-ray Luminosity Functions (XLF) for these two populations. Since the number of\nsources in any given galaxy is small, we coadded sources from a sample of\nnearby, face-on spiral galaxies observed by Chandra as a Large Project in Cycle\n2. We use simulations to carefully correct the XLF for completeness. The\ncomposite hard source XLF is not consistent with a single power-law fit. At\nluminosities Lx>3E38 ergs/s it is well fit by a power law with a slope that is\nconsistent with that found for sources in elliptical galaxies by Kim and\nFabbiano 2004. This is supports the suggestion that the hard sources are\ndominated by LMXBs. In contrast, the high luminosity XLF of soft sources has a\nslope similar to the ``universal'' High Mass X-ray Binary XLF. Some of these\nsources are stellar mass black-hole binaries accreting at high rates in a\nthermal/steep power law state. The softest sources have inferred disk\ntemperatures that are considerably lower than found in galactic black holes\nbinaries. These sources are not well understood, but some may be super-soft\nultra-luminous X-ray sources in a quiescent state as suggested by Soria et al\n2009.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2009 19:48:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

The\nphysical and chemical properties of the shells and their structure are computed\nusing a a simple well known similarity solution for the shell expansion, a\nstellar population synthesis code, and a time-dependent PDR chemistry model.\nThe SEDs for several molecular and atomic lines ($^{12}$CO and its isotope\n$^{13}$CO, HCN, HCO$^+$, C, O, and C$^+$) are computed using a non-local\nthermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) line radiative transfer model. By comparing\nour models with the available observed data of nearby infrared bright galaxies,\nespecially M 82, we constrain the models and in the case of M 82, we provide\nestimates for the ages (5 - 6 Myr, 10 Myr) of recent starburst activity.

Channel-adaptive policies are designed to optimize an average\ntransmit-performance criterion subject to average quality of service\nrequirements. While the resultant optimal policy per fading realization shows\nthat the individual rate and power loadings can be obtained separately for each\nuser, the optimal scheduling is slightly more complicated. Specifically, per\nfading realization each channel is allocated either to a single (winner) user,\nor, to a small group of winner users whose percentage of shared resources is\nfound by solving a linear program.

We\ndevelop in this paper a procedure, based on the autocorrelation of the seismic\nFourier spectrum. We have searched for criteria able to predict the output that\none can expect from the analysis by autocorrelation of a seismic time series.\nFirst, the autocorrelation is properly scaled for taking into account the\ncontribution of white noise. Then, we use the null hypothesis H0 test to assess\nthe reliability of the autocorrelation analysis. Calculations based on solar\nand CoRoT times series are performed in order to quantify the performance as a\nfunction of the amplitude of the autocorrelation signal. We propose an\nautomated determination of the large separation, whose reliability is\nquantified by the H0 test. We apply this method to analyze a large set of red\ngiants observed by CoRoT.

As the overlap with the planetary mass domain increases, the question\nof how these objects form becomes important. The determination of their number\ndensity and whether a mass cut-off limit exists is crucial to understanding\ntheir formation. We propose to search for objects of yet lower masses in the\ncluster and determine the shape of the mass function at low mass. Using new-\nand (re-analysed) published IZJHKs[3.6]-[8.0]-band data of an area of 840\narcmin2, we performed a search for LT-type cluster member candidates in the\nmagnitude range J=19.5-21.5 mag, based on their expected magnitudes and\ncolours. Besides recovering the T type object S Ori 70 and two other known\nobjects, we find three new cluster member candidates, S Ori 72-74, with J=21\nmag and within 12 arcmin of the cluster centre. They have theoretical masses of\n4 (-2,+3) M_Jup and are among the least massive free-floating objects detected\nby direct imaging outside the Solar System. The photometry in archival Spitzer\n[3.6]-[5.8]-band images infers that S Ori 72 is an L/T transition candidate and\nS Ori 73 a T-type candidate, following the expected cluster sequence in the\nmid-infrared. Finally, the L-type candidate S Ori 74 with lower quality\nphotometry is located at 11.8 arcsec (~4250 AU) of a stellar member of sigma\nOrionis and could be a companion. After contaminant correction in the area\ncomplete to J=21.1 mag, we estimate that there remain between zero and two\ncluster members in the mass interval 6-4 M_Jup. Our result suggests a possible\nturnover in the substellar mass spectrum below ~6 Jupiter masses, which could\nbe investigated further by wider and deeper photometric surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Sep 2009 13:56:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2009 13:06:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

We show that the output response\ndepends not only on the lead-sample coupling and on the length of the pulse but\nalso on the states that propagate the input signal. We find that by increasing\nthe bias window the new states available for transport induce additional\nstructure in the relaxation current due to different dynamical tunneling\nprocesses. The delay of the output signal with respect to the input current in\nthe case of the narrow quantum wire is associated to the transient time through\nthe wire.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Sep 2009 05:37:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-27"}

This\nhas been based on asymptotic results that approximate high dimensional\nalgorithm trajectories by diffusions. In this paper, we develop a novel\napproach to understanding 0.234 which avoids the need for diffusion limits. We\nderive explicit formulae for algorithm efficiency and acceptance rates as\nfunctions of the scaling parameter. We apply these to the family of\nelliptically symmetric target densities, where further illuminating explicit\nresults are possible. Under suitable conditions, we verify the 0.234 rule for a\nnew class of target densities. Moreover, we can characterise cases where 0.234\nfails to hold, either because the target density is too diffuse in a sense we\nmake precise, or because the eccentricity of the target density is too severe,\nagain in a sense we make precise. We provide numerical verifications of our\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Sep 2009 11:16:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-07"}

If born in large numbers, such massive stars can have strong\nimpact on the subsequent star formation, producing strong ionising radiation\nand contaminating the primordial gas with heavy elements. They would leave\nbehind massive black holes that could act as seeds for growing supermassive\nblack holes of active galactic nuclei. Given the anticipated fast rotation,\nsuch stars would end their live as supermassive collapsars and drive powerful\nmagnetically-dominated jets. In this letter we investigate the possibility of\nobserving the bursts of high-energy emission similar to the Long Gamma Ray\nBursts associated with normal collapsars. We show that during the collapse of\nsupercollapsars, the Blandford-Znajek mechanism can produce jets as powerful as\nfew$\\times10^{52}$erg/s and release up to $10^{54}$erg of the black hole\nrotational energy. Due to the higher intrinsic time scale and higher redshift\nthe initial bright phase of the burst can last for about $10^4$ seconds,\nwhereas the central engine would remain active for about one day. Due to the\nhigh redshift the burst spectrum is expected to be soft, with the spectral\nenergy distribution peaking at around 20-30keV.

Therefore, measurements are carried out on an ad\nhoc, scale 1, model of a 2\" globe valve. The body is replicated in Plexiglas to\nenable flow visualization and the original stem is heavily instrumented to\nallow force measurements in every direction. The flow loop facility used for\nthis experiment is designed to allow fine-tuning of the cavitation intensity.\nThe experiment is run for a set of cavitation conditions, flow rates and disc\npositions. The results show that the transverse force (perpendicular to the\nstem) can reach the order of the axial force; thus it should not be ignored. We\nalso observed that it depends very weakly on the cavitation levels. Videos made\nwith a high-speed camera allow an interesting understanding of the fluid flow\nand the cavitation creation. Moreover, CFD simulations of this experiment,\nlimited to the single phase flow are compared to the experiments. Through the\nexperimental testing, visual observations, and computational predictions, the\nrole of the cavitation on the fluid forces is better understood.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Sep 2009 12:34:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-07"}

To obtain empirical constraints on the interplay between stellar\nrotation and wind asymmetry, we perform linear Halpha spectropolarimetry on a\nsample of 18 spectroscopically peculiar massive O stars, including OVz, Of?p,\nOe, and Onfp stars, supplemented by an earlier sample of 20 O supergiants.\nDespite their rapid rotation (with vsin(i) up to 400 km/s) most O-type stars\nare found to be spherically symmetric, but with notable exceptions amongst\nspecific object classes. We divide the peculiar O stars into four distinct\ncategories: Groups III and IV include the Oe stars and Onfp stars, which are on\nthe high-end tail of the O star rotation distribution and have in the past been\nclaimed to be embedded in disks. Here we report the detection of a classical\ndepolarization ``line effect'' in the Oe star HD 45314, but the overall\nincidence of line effects amongst Oe stars is significantly lower (1 out of 6)\nthan amongst Be stars. The chance that the Oe and Be datasets are drawn from\nthe same parent population is negligible (with 95% confidence). This implies\nthere is as yet no evidence for a disk hypothesis in Oe stars, providing\nrelevant constraints on the physical mechanism that is responsible for the Be\nphenomenon.

The\nproblem of the existence of a (semi-)time function on spacetime and the problem\nof recovering the causal structure starting from the set of time functions are\nstudied. It is pointed out that these problems have an analog in the field of\nmicroeconomics known as utility theory. In a chronological spacetime the\nsemi-time functions correspond to the utilities for the chronological relation,\nwhile in a K-causal (stably causal) spacetime the time functions correspond to\nthe utilities for the K^+ relation (Seifert's relation).

As a consequence, we prove\nthat a K-causal (i.e. stably causal) spacetime admits a time function and that\nthe time or temporal functions can be used to recover the K^+ (or Seifert)\nrelation which indeed turns out to be the intersection of the time or temporal\norderings. This result tells us in which circumstances it is possible to\nrecover the chronological or causal relation starting from the set of time or\ntemporal functions allowed by the spacetime. Moreover, it is proved that a\nchronological spacetime in which the closure of the causal relation is\ntransitive (for instance a reflective spacetime) admits a semi-time function.\nAlong the way a new proof avoiding smoothing techniques is given that the\nexistence of a time function implies stable causality, and a new short proof of\nthe equivalence between K-causality and stable causality is given which takes\nadvantage of Levin's theorem and smoothing techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Sep 2009 13:35:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-23"}

Finally, we show the occurrence of a doubling of the main edge peak\nthat is most visible when the polarization is along the c-axis. This doubling,\nthat has not been seen in any previous absorption data in cuprates, is not\nreproduced by first principles calculations. We suggest that this peak is due\nto many-body charge-transfer excitations, while all the other visible far-edge\nstructures are single particle in origin. Our work indicates that previous\ninterpretations of the Cu K-edge X-ray absorption spectra in high T$_c$\ncuprates can be profitably reconsidered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Sep 2009 13:55:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 May 2010 08:41:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The optically-thin\napproximation begins to break down even for column densities as small as 2 x\n10^22 cm^-2.
