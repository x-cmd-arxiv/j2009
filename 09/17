In wireless networks, the channel of a user is not fixed but varies\nrandomly. Thus, in order to maximize the throughput of the MAC protocol at any\ngiven time, only users with large channel gains should be allowed to transmit.\nIn this paper, compressive sensing based opportunistic protocol for throughput\nimprovement in wireless networks is proposed. The protocol is based on the\ntraditional protocol of R-ALOHA which allows users to compete for channel\naccess before reserving the channel to the best user. We use compressive\nsensing to find the best user, and show that the proposed protocol requires\nless time for reservation and so it outperforms other schemes proposed in\nliterature. This makes the protocol particularly suitable for enhancing R-ALOHA\nin fast fading environments.

Both nonequilibrium figures and\nfigures elongated by imaginary rotation are represented on the\nellipticity-rotation plane. An application is made to a reduced sample of\nelliptical galaxies. The position on the ellipticity-rotation plane of both\nsample objects and related adjoint configurations with isotropic stress tensor\nis inferred from existing observations within the SAURON project.

A possible interpretation of slow rotators as nonrotating at all and\nelongated due to negative anisotropy parameters, is exploited. Finally, the\nelliptical side of the Hubble sequence is interpreted as a sequence of\nequilibrium (adjoint) configurations where the ellipticity is an increasing\nfunction of the rotation parameter, slow rotators correspond to early classes\nand fast rotators to late classes. In this view, boundaries are rotationally\ndistorted regardless of angular momentum and stress tensor, where rotation has\nto be intended as due to additional kinetic energy of tangential equatorial\nvelocity components, with respect to spherical configurations with isotropic\nstress tensor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2009 16:21:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

We show that the former form of the proximity force\napproximation overestimates the expected Yukawa force and that the relative\ndeviation from the exact Yukawa force is of the same order of magnitude, in the\nrealistic experimental settings, as the relative deviation expected between the\nexact Casimir force and the Casimir force evaluated in the proximity force\napproximation. This implies both a systematic shift making the actual limits to\nthe Yukawa force weaker than claimed so far, and a degree of uncertainty in the\nalpha-lambda plane related to the handling of the various approximations used\nin the theory for both the Casimir and the Yukawa forces. We further argue that\nthe recently discussed form for the proximity force approximation is\nequivalent, for a geometry made of a generic object interacting with an\ninfinite planar slab, to the usual exact integration of any additive two-body\ninteraction, without any need to invoke approximation schemes.

The observed planet-to-star flux ratios in\nall four IRAC channels can be explained by models with and without a thermal\ninversion in the atmosphere of TrES-2, although with different atmospheric\nchemistry. Based on the assumption of thermochemical equilibrium, the chemical\ncomposition of the inversion model seems more plausible, making it a more\nfavorable scenario. TrES-2 also falls in the category of highly irradiated\nplanets which have been theoretically predicted to exhibit thermal inversions.\nHowever, more observations at infrared and visible wavelengths would be needed\nto confirm a thermal inversion in this system. Furthermore, we find that the\ntimes of the secondary eclipses are consistent with previously published times\nof transit and the expectation from a circular orbit. This implies that TrES-2\nmost likely has a circular orbit, and thus does not obtain additional thermal\nenergy from tidal dissipation of a non-zero orbital eccentricity, a proposed\nexplanation for the large radius of this planet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2009 17:53:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Dec 2009 02:27:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

In\nthe low-energy limit, neutrino self-interactions are entirely off-diagonal\nbecause same-flavor four-fermion operators vanish by Pauli exclusion. These\ninteractions must be diagonalized when propagating through a bath of neutrinos,\nusing the U(3) global flavor symmetry. U(3) gets broken broken down to SO(3) by\nMajorana masses, and down to $A_4$ if the three masses are different. Thus our\nuniverse today contains tri-bimaximal mixing and Majorana neutrinos. Neutrino\nmixing is due to the mismatch between the flavor-diagonal Majorana mass matrix\narising at finite density and the self-interaction diagonal finite density\npropagator. The mass hierarchy is inverted and Majorana phases are absent.\nLepton number is conserved and the neutrino-less double beta decay experiment\nabsorbs a pair of neutrinos from the relic background and will prove their\nMajorana nature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2009 19:56:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Feb 2013 19:23:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-13"}

In spite of their existence, little is known on how to\nconstruct such encoders in practice. This paper is devoted to their\nconstruction. In particular, two families of linear encoders are presented and\nproved to have good joint spectra. The first family is derived from Gabidulin\ncodes, a class of maximum-rank-distance codes. The second family is constructed\nusing a serial concatenation of an encoder of a low-density parity-check code\n(as outer encoder) with a low-density generator matrix encoder (as inner\nencoder). In addition, criteria for good linear encoders are defined for three\ncoding applications: lossless source coding, channel coding, and lossless JSCC.\nIn the framework of the code-spectrum approach, these three scenarios\ncorrespond to the problems of constructing linear encoders with good kernel\nspectra, good image spectra, and good joint spectra, respectively. Good joint\nspectra imply both good kernel spectra and good image spectra, and for every\nlinear encoder having a good kernel (resp., image) spectrum, it is proved that\nthere exists a linear encoder not only with the same kernel (resp., image) but\nalso with a good joint spectrum.

Namely, we reduce such problems to classification (up to homotopy) of\nmaps from BG to classifiying spaces of certain higher groupoids. In particular,\nto every fusion category C we attach the 3-groupoid BrPic(C) of invertible\nC-bimodule categories, called the Brauer-Picard groupoid of C, such that\nequivalence classes of G-extensions of C are in bijection with homotopy classes\nof maps from BG to the classifying space of BrPic(C). This gives rise to an\nexplicit description of both the obstructions to existence of extensions and\nthe data parametrizing them; we work these out both topologically and\nalgebraically.\n  One of the central results of the paper is that the 2-truncation of BrPic(C)\nis canonically the 2-groupoid of braided autoequivalences of the Drinfeld\ncenter Z(C) of C. In particular, this implies that the Brauer-Picard group\nBrPic(C) (i.e., the group of equivalence classes of invertible C-bimodule\ncategories) is naturally isomorphic to the group of braided autoequivalences of\nZ(C). Thus, if C=Vec(A), where A is a finite abelian group, then BrPic(C) is\nthe orthogonal group O(A+A^*). This allows one to obtain a rather explicit\nclassification of extensions in this case; in particular, in the case G=Z/2, we\nrederive (without computations) the classical result of Tambara and Yamagami.\nMoreover, we explicitly describe the category of all (Vec(A1),Vec(A2))-bimodule\ncategories (not necessarily invertible ones) by showing that it is equivalent\nto the hyperbolic part of the category of Lagrangian correspondences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2009 02:17:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Dec 2009 02:10:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-29"}

There is thus an expectation that the stellar\nmasses of the most massive galaxies will also rapidly grow via merging over\nthis redshift range. While there are examples of massive merging galaxies at\nlow redshift, recent observations show that the stellar masses of massive\ngalaxies have grown by only 30% since z=1. Some of the literature claims that\nthe slow growth of massive galaxies is contrary to the CDM paradigm, although\nthis is not necessarily the case. To determine why massive galaxies are not\ngrowing rapidly, we have modeled how galaxies populate dark matter halos. To do\nthis, we have measured the space density and spatial clustering of redshift z<1\ngalaxies in the Bootes field of the NOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey. We have then\nmodeled the observations using the halo occupation distribution (HOD)\nformalism. We find that the stellar masses of the largest galaxies are\nproportional to dark matter halo mass to the power of a third. In the most\nmassive dark matter halos, we also find that the stellar mass is distributed\nmostly among \"satellite\" galaxies. As a consequence, the stellar masses of\nlarge galaxies are expected to increase relatively slowly, even though they\nreside within rapidly growing dark matter halos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2009 03:39:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

When\ndealing with an ensemble of pure quantum states, two questions naturally arise:\nwhat is the probability density function on the parameters which specify the\nstate of the system in a given ensemble? And, does there exist a most typical\nvalue of a function of interest in the considered ensemble?

Previous studies found that the magnetic\nfield has a very strong impact on the collapse of a prestellar cloud,\nparticularly in possibly suppressing the formation of a disk even for\nrelatively modest values of the magnetic intensity. Since observations infer\nthat cores have a substantial level of magnetization, this raises the question\nof how disks form. However, most studies have been restricted to the case in\nwhich the initial angle, $\\alpha$, between the magnetic field and the rotation\naxis equals 0$^\\circ$. We explore and analyse the influence of non aligned\nconfigurations on disk formation. We perform 3D ideal MHD, AMR numerical\nsimulations for various values of $\\mu$, the ratio of the mass-to-flux to the\ncritical mass-to-flux, and various values of $\\alpha$. We find that disks form\nmore easily as $\\alpha$ increases from 0 to 90$^\\circ$. We propose that as the\nmagnetized pseudo-disks become thicker with increasing $\\alpha$, the magnetic\nbraking efficiency is lowered. We also find that even small values of $\\alpha$\n($\\simeq$ 10-20$^\\circ$) show significant differences with the alligned case.\nWithin the framework of ideal MHD and for our choice of initial conditions,\ncentrifugally supported disks cannot form for values of $\\mu$ smaller than\n$\\simeq$3, if the magnetic field and the rotation axis are perpendicular, and\nsmaller than about $\\simeq$5-10 when they are perfectly aligned.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2009 11:25:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2009 10:25:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The latter is sufficient to\noriginate a Hopf bifurcation in that region of parameters in which there is a\nsufficiently strong negative feedback. We find a sharp bifurcation in parameter\nspace, and define the threshold as the point in which the stationary\ndistribution function p(x) changes from a delta function at the trivial state\nx=0 to p(x) ~ x^alpha at small x (with alpha = -1 exactly at threshold).

Ad hoc model MISMAs also explain the asymmetric\nStokes profiles observed by Hinode. The same modeling may be consistent with\nmagnetograms of dark cored penumbral filaments if the dark cores are associated\nwith the reverse polarity.

A short-ranged attraction\ndrives clustering, while a weak, long-ranged repulsion is used to model\nelectrostatic charging in experimental systems. The former is treated with a\nshort-ranged Morse attractive interaction, the latter with a repulsive Yukawa\ninteraction. We consider the yield of clusters of specific structure as a\nfunction of the strength of the interactions, for clusters with m=3,4,5,6,7,10\nand 13 colloids. At sufficient strengths of the attractive interaction (around\n10 kT), the average bond lifetime approaches the simulation timescale and the\nsystem becomes nonergodic. For small clusters m<=5 where geometric frustration\nis not relevant, despite nonergodicity, for sufficient strengths of the\nattractive interaction the yield of clusters which maximise the number of bonds\napproaches 100%. However for $m=7$ and higher, in the nonergodic regime we find\na lower yield of these structures where we argue geometric frustration plays a\nsignificant role. $m=6$ is a special case, where two structures, of octahedral\nand C2v symmetry compete, with the latter being favoured by entropic\ncontributions in the ergodic regime and by kinetic trapping in the nonergodic\nregime.

The results are\noptimal in terms of the dimension of the varifold and the exponent of the\nLebesgue space in most cases, for example if the varifold is not\ntwo-dimensional.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2009 15:38:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2009 10:01:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2011 11:25:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-03"}

The inflaton and waterfall fields are\nrealized as naturally light moduli of the 5D compactification. At the quantum\nlevel, waterfall loops must be cut off at a scale considerably lower than the\ninflaton field transit in order to preserve slow-roll dynamics without\nfine-tuning. We accomplish this by a significant warping, or redshift, between\nthe extra-dimensional regions in which the inflaton and waterfall fields are\nlocalized. The mechanisms we employ have been separately realized in string\ntheory, which suggests that a string UV completion of our model is possible. We\nstudy a part of the parameter space in which the cosmology takes a standard\nform, but we point out that it is also possible for some regions of space to\nend inflation by quantum tunneling. Such regions may provide new cosmological\nsignals, which we will study in future work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2009 15:37:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2009 20:47:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 14 Jun 2010 18:58:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

Selecting a time interval covering two stellar rotations and six\ntransits of the planetary companion CoRoT-2b, we adopt a `strip' model of the\nsurface to reproduce the photometric modulation inside and outside the transits\nsimultaneously. Our reconstructions show that it is possible to achieve\nappropriate fits for the entire sub-interval using a low-resolution surface\nmodel with 36 strips. The surface reconstructions indicate that the brightness\non the eclipsed section of the stellar surface is (6 +/- 1) % lower than the\naverage brightness of the remaining surface. This result suggests a\nconcentration of stellar activity in a band around the stellar equator similar\nto the behavior observed on the Sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2009 15:55:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}
