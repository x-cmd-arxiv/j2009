By\nanalogy with Neptune and Uranus, they are likely to have metal abundances that\nare an order of magnitude or more greater than those of larger, more massive\nplanets. This increases their opacity, decreases Rayleigh scattering, and\nchanges their equation of state. Furthermore, their smaller radii mean that\nfluxes from these planets are roughly an order of magnitude lower than those of\notherwise identical gas giant planets.

High resolution allowed\nthe use of realistic initial disk models where both the vertical structure and\nthe local Jeans mass were resolved. The results show that objects with masses\nranging from giant planets to low mass stars can form during such encounters\nfrom initially stable disks. The parameter space of initial spin-orbit\norientations and the azimuthal angles for each disk was explored. An upper\nlimit on the initial Toomre Q value of ~2 was found for fragmentation to occur.\nDepending on the initial configuration, shocks, tidal-tail structures and mass\ninflows were responsible for the condensation of disk gas. Retrograde disks\nwere generally more likely to fragment. When the interaction timescale was\nsignificantly shorter than the disks' dynamical timescales, the proto-stellar\ndisks tended to be truncated without forming objects.\n  The newly-formed objects had masses ranging from 0.9 to 127 Jupiter masses,\nwith the majority in the BD regime.

Waves\nthat propagate vertically through the stratified solar atmosphere affect\ndifferent wavelengths at different times. This leads to a characteristic\npattern of (non-)coherence of the intensity at various wavelengths. We derived\nthe correlation matrices for several photospheric and chromospheric spectral\nlines from observations. For comparison with the observations, we calculate\ncorrelation matrices for spectra from LTE modeling approaches, 1-D NLTE\nsimulations, and a 3-D MHD simulation run. We apply the correlation method also\nto temperature maps at different optical depth layers. We find that all\nphotospheric spectral lines show a similar pattern: a pronounced asymmetry of\nthe correlation between line core and red or blue wing. The pattern cannot be\nreproduced with a simulation of the granulation pattern, but with waves that\ntravel upwards. All chromospheric spectral lines show a more complex pattern.\nIn the case of Ca II H, the 1-D NLTE simulations of monochromatic waves produce\na correlation matrix that qualitatively matches to the observations. The\nphotospheric signature is well reproduced in the matrix derived from the 3-D\nMHD simulation. The correlation matrices of observed photospheric and\nchromospheric spectral lines are highly structured with characteristic and\ndifferent patterns in every spectral line. The comparison with matrices derived\nfrom simulations and simple modeling suggests that the main driver of the\ndetected patterns are upwards propagating waves. Application of the correlation\nmethod to 3-D temperature cubes seems to be a promising tool for a detailed\ncomparison of simulation results and observations in future studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2009 17:43:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

In this paper a modification\nof Hoeffding's test is considered based on a relaxation of the K-L divergence\ntest statistic, referred to as the mismatched divergence. The resulting\nmismatched test is shown to be a generalized likelihood-ratio test (GLRT) for\nthe case where the alternate distribution lies in a parametric family of the\ndistributions characterized by a finite dimensional parameter, i.e., it is a\nsolution to the corresponding composite hypothesis testing problem. For certain\nchoices of the alternate distribution, it is shown that both the Hoeffding test\nand the mismatched test have the same asymptotic performance in terms of error\nexponents. A consequence of this result is that the GLRT is optimal in\ndifferentiating a particular distribution from others in an exponential family.\nIt is also shown that the mismatched test has a significant advantage over the\nHoeffding test in terms of finite sample size performance. This advantage is\ndue to the difference in the asymptotic variances of the two test statistics\nunder the null hypothesis. In particular, the variance of the K-L divergence\ngrows linearly with the alphabet size, making the test impractical for\napplications involving large alphabet distributions. The variance of the\nmismatched divergence on the other hand grows linearly with the dimension of\nthe parameter space, and can hence be controlled through a prudent choice of\nthe function class defining the mismatched divergence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2009 18:35:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2010 16:49:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 9 Sep 2010 06:56:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

To\nthis end, we model the boundary-driven kinematic emergence of a compact,\nintense, and uniformly twisted flux tube into a potential field arcade that\noverlies a weakly twisted coronal flux rope. The expansion of the emerging flux\nin the corona gives rise to the formation of a nullpoint at the interface of\nthe emerging and the pre-existing fields. We unveil a two-step reconnection\nprocess at the nullpoint that eventually yields the formation of a broad 3D\nfan-spine configuration above the emerging bipole. The first reconnection\ninvolves emerging fields and a set of large-scale arcade field lines. It\nresults in the launch of a torsional MHD wave that propagates along the\narcades, and in the formation of a sheared loop system on one side of the\nemerging flux. The second reconnection occurs between these newly formed loops\nand remote arcade fields, and yields the formation of a second loop system on\nthe opposite side of the emerging flux. The two loop systems collectively\ndisplay an anenome pattern that is located below the fan surface. The flux that\nsurrounds the inner spine field line of the nullpoint retains a fraction of the\nemerged twist, while the remaining twist is evacuated along the reconnected\narcades. The nature and timing of the features which occur in the simulation do\nqualititatively reproduce those observed by XRT in the particular event studied\nin this paper. Moreover, the two-step reconnection process suggests a new\nconsistent and generic model for the formation of anemone regions in the solar\ncorona.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2009 18:37:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

Here we present an X-ray imaging study of\ntwo patches from the CNOC2 spectroscopic galaxy survey using combined Chandra\nand XMM data. A state of the art extended source finding algorithm has been\napplied, and the resultant source catalog, including redshifts from a\nspectroscopic follow-up program, is presented.

Statistical modeling shows that this is consistent\nwith expectations, assuming an expected evolution of the Lx-M relation. A\nsignificant detection of a stacked shear signal for both spectroscopic and\nX-ray groups indicates that both samples contain real groups of about the\nexpected mass. We conclude that the current area and depth of X-ray and\nspectroscopic facilities provide a unique window of opportunity at z~0.4 to\ntest the X-ray appearance of galaxy groups selected in various ways.

For Halpha line emission twice\nas strong as the ambient continuum, the survey is complete to spectral type\nB2/B3 on the main sequence. About 8120 spectra of 4437 stars were searched for\nemission lines in 84 open clusters. 370 emission-line stars were found, among\nthem at least 231 near the main sequence. For 176 of them, photometry could be\nfound in the OGLE database. For comparison with a higher-metallicity\nenvironment, the Galactic sample of the photometric Halpha survey by McSwain &\nGies (2005) was used. Among early spectral sub-types, Be stars are more\nfrequent by a factor 3-5 in the SMC than in the Galaxy. The distribution with\nspectral type is similar in both galaxies, i.e. not strongly dependent on\nmetallicity. The fraction of Be stars does not seem to vary with local star\ndensity. The Be phenomenon mainly sets in towards the end of the main-sequence\nevolution (this trend may be more pronounced in the SMC); but some Be stars\nalready form with Be-star characteristics. In all probability, the fractional\ncritical angular rotation rate, \\omc, is one of the main parameters governing\nthe occurrence of the Be phenomenon. If the Be character is only acquired\nduring the course of evolution, the key circumstance is the evolution of \\omc,\nwhich not only is dependent on metallicity but differently so for different\nmass ranges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Sep 2009 04:46:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

In particular we seek\nto assess whether the 3D model is appropriate to derive the solar oxygen\nabundance. Methods: We use our recent observations of OI 777 nm, OI 615.81 nm,\n[OI] 630.03 nm and nine lines of other elements for five viewing angles\n0.2<mu<1 of the quiet solar disk. We compare them with the predicted line\nprofiles from the 3D and 1D models computed using the most up-to-date line\nformation codes, line data and allowing for departures of LTE. The CLV of the\nOI 777 nm lines is also used to obtain an empirical correction for the poorly\nknown efficiency of the inelastic collisions with H. Results: The 3D model\ngenerally reproduces the CLV observations of the lines very well, particularly\nthe oxygen lines. From the OI 777 nm lines we find that the classical Drawin\nrecipe slightly overestimates H collisions. The limb observations of the OI\n615.82 nm line allow us to identify a previously unknown contribution of\nmolecules for this line, prevalent at the solar limb.

However, there\nis insufficient energy in the acoustic flux to balance the chromospheric\nradiative losses in the network, even for the strong field case.

The\nobservation and analysis of the thermally excited particle oscillations\nrevealed the collective mode structure and wave dispersion in this system; in\nparticular the existence of the theoretically predicted $k=0$ energy\n(frequency) gap was verified. Equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations were\nperformed to emulate the experiment, assuming Yukawa type inter-particle\ninteraction. The simulations and analytic calculations based both on lattice\nsummation and on the QLCA approach are in good agreement with the experimental\nfindings and help identifying and characterizing the observed phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Sep 2009 14:19:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-02"}

Radio and X-ray surveys allow to investigate the\nstatistics of halos and may contribute to constrain their origin and evolution.\nWe investigate the distribution of clusters in the plane X-ray (thermal, L_X)\nvs synchrotron (P_{1.4})luminosity, where clusters hosting giant radio halos\ntrace the P_{1.4}--L_X correlation and clusters without radio halos populate a\nregion that is well separated from that spanned by the above correlation. The\nconnection between radio halos and cluster mergers suggests that the cluster\nMpc-scale synchrotron emission is amplified during these mergers and then\nsuppressed when clusters become more dynamically relaxed. In this context, by\nanalysing the distribution in the P_{1.4}--L_X plane of clusters from X-ray\nselected samples with adequate radio follow up, we constrain the typical\ntime-scale of evolution of diffuse radio emission in clusters and discuss the\nimplications for the origin of radio halos. We conclude that cluster\nsynchrotron emission is suppressed (and amplified) in a time-scale\nsignificantly smaller than 1 Gyr. We show that this constraint appears\ndifficult to reconcile with the hypothesis that the halo's radio power is\nsuppressed due to dissipation of magnetic field in galaxy clusters. On the\nother hand, in agreement with models where turbulent acceleration plays a role,\npresent constraints suggest that relativistic electrons are accelerated in\nMpc-scale regions, in connection with cluster mergers and for a time-interval\nof about 1 Gyr, and then they cool in a relatively small time-scale, when the\nhosting cluster becomes more dynamically relaxed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Sep 2009 15:02:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2009 09:46:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The proposed method\nfirst creates labeled-link network representation of the weblog datasets, where\nthe nodes are the blogs and the labels are the shared words. Then, 3-way\nadjacency tensor is extracted from the network and the PARAFAC decomposition is\napplied to the tensor to get pairs of node lists and label lists with scores\nattached to each list as the indication of the degree of importance. The\nclustering is done by sorting the lists in decreasing order and taking the\npairs of top ranked blogs and words. Thus, unlike standard co-clustering\nmethods, this method not only groups the similar blogs with their descriptive\nwords but also tends to produce clusters of important blogs and descriptive\nwords.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Sep 2009 15:53:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-15"}
