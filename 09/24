First, we study the multiple-input\nsingle-output (MISO) finite state compound broadcast channel (BC) with\narbitrary number of users and antennas at the transmitter. In prior work,\nWeingarten et. al. have found inner and outer bounds on the DoF with 2 users.\nThe bounds have a different character. While the inner bound collapses to unity\nas the number of states increases, the outer bound does not diminish with the\nincreasing number of states beyond a threshold value. It has been conjectured\nthat the outer bound is loose and the inner bound represents the actual DoF. In\nthe complex setting (all signals, noise, and channel coefficients are complex\nvariables) we solve a few cases to find that the outer bound -and not the inner\nbound- of Weingarten et. al. is tight. For the real setting (all signals, noise\nand channel coefficients are real variables) we completely characterize the\nDoF, once again proving that the outer bound of Weingarten et. al. is tight. We\nalso extend the results to arbitrary number of users. Second, we characterize\nthe DoF of finite state scalar (single antenna nodes) compound X networks with\narbitrary number of users in the real setting. Third, we characterize the DoF\nof finite state scalar compound interference networks with arbitrary number of\nusers in both the real and complex setting. The key finding is that scalar\ninterference networks and (real) X networks do not lose any DoF due to channel\nuncertainty at the transmitter in the finite state compound setting. The finite\nstate compound MISO BC does lose DoF relative to the perfect CSIT scenario.\nHowever, what is lost is only the DoF benefit of joint processing at transmit\nantennas, without which the MISO BC reduces to an X network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2009 19:59:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-24"}

However,\nthere are still many questions surrounding the SMBH - galaxy relations. For\nexample, are the scaling relations linear and constant throughout cosmic\nhistory, and do all SMBHs lie on the scaling relations? These questions can\nonly be answered by further high quality direct M estimates from a wide range\nin redshift. In this paper we determine the observational requirements\nnecessary to directly determine SMBH masses, across cosmological distances,\nusing current M modeling techniques. We also discuss the SMBH detection\nabilities of future facilities. We find that if different M modeling\ntechniques, using different spectral features, can be shown to be consistent,\nthen both 30 m ground- and 16 m space-based telescopes will be able to sample M\n1e9Msol across ~95% of cosmic history. However, we find that the abilities of\nground-based telescopes critically depend on future advancements in adaptive\noptics systems; more limited AO systems will result in limited effective\nspatial resolutions, and forces observations towards the near-infrared where\nspectral features are weaker and more susceptible to sky features. Ground-based\nAO systems will always be constrained by relatively bright sky backgrounds and\natmospheric transmission. The latter forces the use of multiple spectral\nfeatures and dramatically impacts the SMBH detection efficiency. The most\nefficient way to advance our database of direct SMBH masses is therefore\nthrough the use of a large (16 m) space-based UVOIR telescope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2009 16:13:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

One remarkable result is the absence\nof an epidemic threshold in infinite-size scale-free networks, which implies\nthat any infection will perpetually propagate regardless of the spreading rate.\nThe vast majority of current theoretical approaches assumes that infections are\ntransmitted as a reaction process from nodes to all neighbors. Here we adopt a\ndifferent perspective and show that the epidemic incidence is shaped by traffic\nflow conditions. Specifically, we consider the scenario in which epidemic\npathways are defined and driven by flows. Through extensive numerical\nsimulations and theoretical predictions, it is shown that the value of the\nepidemic threshold in scale-free networks depends directly on flow conditions,\nin particular on the first and second moments of the betweenness distribution\ngiven a routing protocol. We consider the scenarios in which the delivery\ncapability of the nodes is bounded or unbounded. In both cases, the threshold\nvalues depend on the traffic and decrease as flow increases. Bounded delivery\nprovokes the emergence of congestion, slowing down the spreading of the disease\nand setting a limit for the epidemic incidence. Our results provide a general\nconceptual framework to understand spreading processes on complex networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2009 18:51:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-08"}

He made three points; that 5 out of 11\nnovae showed pre-eruption rises in the years before eruption, that one nova\n(V446 Her) showed drastic changes in the variability across eruptions, and that\nall but one of the novae (excepting BT Mon) have the same quiescent magnitudes\nbefore and after the outburst. This work has not been tested since it came out.\nWe have now tested these results by going back to the original archival\nphotographic plates and measuring large numbers of pre-eruption magnitudes for\nmany novae using comparison stars on a modern magnitude scale. We find in\nparticular that four out of five claimed pre-eruption rises are due to simple\nmistakes in the old literature, that V446 Her has the same amplitude of\nvariations across its 1960 eruption, and that BT Mon has essentially unchanged\nbrightness across its 1939 eruption. Out of 22 nova eruptions, we find two\nconfirmed cases of significant pre-eruption rises (for V533 Her and V1500 Cyg),\nwhile T CrB has a deep pre-eruption dip. These events are a challenge to\ntheorists. We find no significant cases of changes in variability across 27\nnova eruptions beyond what is expected due to the usual fluctuations seen in\nnovae away from eruptions. For 30 classical novae plus 19 eruptions from 6\nrecurrent novae, we find that the average change in magnitude from before the\neruption to long after the eruption is 0.0 mag. However, we do find five novae\n(V723 Cas, V1500 Cyg, V1974 Cyg, V4633 Sgr, and RW UMi) that have significantly\nlarge changes, in that the post-eruption quiescent brightness level is over ten\ntimes brighter than the pre-eruption level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2009 19:50:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

In this\nletter we report the results of turbulent self-gravitating simulations of\ncluster formation in which we consider both clouds in virial balance and those\nundergoing global collapse. We find that stars in these simulations generally\nhave velocity dispersions smaller than that of the gas by a factor of ~ 5,\nindependent of the dynamical state of the parent cloud, so that subvirial\nstellar velocity dispersions arise naturally even in virialized molecular\nclouds. The simulated clusters also show large-scale stellar velocity gradients\nof ~0.2-2 km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{-1}$ and strong correlations between the centroid\nvelocities of stars and gas, both of which are observed in young clusters. We\nconclude that star clusters should display subvirial velocity dispersions,\nlarge-scale velocity gradients, and strong gas-star velocity correlations\nregardless of whether their parent clouds are in virial balance, and,\nconversely, that observations of these features cannot be used to infer the\ndynamical state of the parent gas clouds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2009 20:11:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

For M_* ~ 5.5 x 10^10 M_sun, the\nstellar mass usually assumed for the Milky Way, the implied halo mass is ~ 2 x\n10^12 M_sun, consistent with most recent direct estimates and inferences from\nthe MW/M31 Timing Argument.

In a model where the\ntotal ionizing luminosity is divided equally between X-ray and EUV luminosity,\nwe find a photoevaporation rate of 1.4e-8 M_sun/yr, which is two orders of\nmagnitude greater than the case of EUV photoevaporation alone. Thus it is clear\nthat the X-rays are the dominant driving mechanism for photoevaporation. This\ncan be understood inasmuch as X-rays are capable of penetrating much larger\ncolumns (~1e22 cm^-2) and can thus effect heating in denser regions and at\nlarger radius than the EUV can. The radial extent of the launching region of\nthe X-ray heated wind is 1-70AU compared with the pure EUV case where the\nlaunch region is concentrated around a few AU. When we couple our wind\nmass-loss rates with models for the disc's viscous evolution, we find that, as\nin the pure EUV case, there is a photoevaporative switch, such that an inner\nhole develops at ~ 1 AU at the point that the accretion rate in the disc drops\nbelow the wind mass loss rate. At this point, the remaining disc material is\nquickly removed in the final 15-20% of the disc's lifetime. This is consistent\nwith the 1e5 yr transitional timescale estimated from observations of T-Tauri\nstars. We also caution that although our mass-loss rates are high compared to\nsome accretion rates observed in young stars, our model has a rather large\nX-ray luminosity of 2e30 erg/s; further modeling is required in order to\ninvestigate the evolutionary implications of the large observed spread of X-ray\nluminosities in T-Tauri stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2009 15:27:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

It is\nwell known that at high temperatures, the time it takes this chain to mix in\n$L^1$ on a system of size $n$ is $O(\\log n)$. Whether in this regime there is\ncutoff, i.e. a sharp transition in the $L^1$-convergence to equilibrium, is a\nfundamental open problem: If so, as conjectured by Peres, it would imply that\nmixing occurs abruptly at $(c+o(1))\\log n$ for some fixed $c>0$, thus providing\na rigorous stopping rule for this MCMC sampler. However, obtaining the precise\nasymptotics of the mixing and proving cutoff can be extremely challenging even\nfor fairly simple Markov chains. Already for the one-dimensional Ising model,\nshowing cutoff is a longstanding open problem.\n  We settle the above by establishing cutoff and its location at the high\ntemperature regime of the Ising model on the lattice with periodic boundary\nconditions. Our results hold for any dimension and at any temperature where\nthere is strong spatial mixing: For $\\Z^2$ this carries all the way to the\ncritical temperature. Specifically, for fixed $d\\geq 1$, the continuous-time\nGlauber dynamics for the Ising model on $(\\Z/n\\Z)^d$ with periodic boundary\nconditions has cutoff at $(d/2\\lambda_\\infty)\\log n$, where $\\lambda_\\infty$ is\nthe spectral gap of the dynamics on the infinite-volume lattice. To our\nknowledge, this is the first time where cutoff is shown for a Markov chain\nwhere even understanding its stationary distribution is limited.\n  The proof hinges on a new technique for translating $L^1$ to $L^2$ mixing\nwhich enables the application of log-Sobolev inequalities. The technique is\ngeneral and carries to other monotone and anti-monotone spin-systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2009 21:13:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

An initial collapse phase is\nimmediately followed by an increase in temperature which represents the switch\non of a central massive star and the subsequent evolution of the chemistry in a\nhot, dense gas cloud (the hot core). During the collapse phase, gas species are\nallowed to accrete on to grain surfaces where they can participate in further\nreactions.

A fundamental question is what\nsymmetries are broken when that phase sets in below a temperature T*. There is\nevidence from both polarized neutron diffraction and polar Kerr effect\nmeasurements that time- reversal symmetry is broken, but at temperatures that\ndiffer significantly. Broken rotational symmetry was detected by both\nresistivity and inelastic neutron scattering at low doping and by scanning\ntunnelling spectroscopy at low temperature, but with no clear connection to T*.\nHere we report the observation of a large in-plane anisotropy of the Nernst\neffect in YBa2Cu3Oy that sets in precisely at T*, throughout the doping phase\ndiagram.

In this setting, we study how to\nfind a solution which is optimal irrespective of the missing preferences. In\nthe process of finding such a solution, we may elicit preferences from the user\nif necessary. However, our goal is to ask the user as little as possible. We\ndefine a combined solving and preference elicitation scheme with a large number\nof different instantiations, each corresponding to a concrete algorithm which\nwe compare experimentally. We compute both the number of elicited preferences\nand the \"user effort\", which may be larger, as it contains all the preference\nvalues the user has to compute to be able to respond to the elicitation\nrequests. While the number of elicited preferences is important when the\nconcern is to communicate as little information as possible, the user effort\nmeasures also the hidden work the user has to do to be able to communicate the\nelicited preferences. Our experimental results show that some of our algorithms\nare very good at finding a necessarily optimal solution while asking the user\nfor only a very small fraction of the missing preferences. The user effort is\nalso very small for the best algorithms. Finally, we test these algorithms on\nhard constraint problems with possibly missing constraints, where the aim is to\nfind feasible solutions irrespective of the missing constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2009 13:54:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}

The ability of the perturbative\nmethod to separate the inner and outer contributions of the potential in\ngravitational lenses is tested using SL2S02176-0513. In this lens, the\ngravitational field of the central galaxy is dominated by a nearby group of\ngalaxies located at a distance of a few critical radius. The perturbative\nfunctionals are re-constructed using local polynomials. The polynomial\ninterpolation is smoothed using Fourier series, and numerically fitted to HST\ndata using a non-linear minimization procedure. The potential inside and\noutside the critical circle is derived from the reconstruction of the\nperturbative fields. The inner and outer potential contours are very\ndifferent.The inner contours are consistent with the central galaxy, while the\nouter contours are fully consistent with the perturbation introduced by the\ngroup of galaxies. The ability of the perturbative method to separate the inner\nand outer contribution is confirmed, and indicates that in the perturbative\napproach the field of the central deflector can be separated from outer\nperturbations. The separation of the inner and outer contribution is especially\nimportant for the study of the shape of dark matter halo's as well as for the\nstatistical analysis of the effect of dark matter substructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2009 15:56:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

These succinct\ngraphical descriptions of access allow us to take known results from graph\ntheory to make statements on the generalisation of the previous schemes to\npresent new secret sharing protocols.\n  Second, we give a set of necessary conditions as to when a graph with flow,\ni.e. capable of performing a class of unitary operations, can be extended to\ninclude vertices which can be ignored, pointless measurements, and hence\nconsidered as unauthorised players in terms of secret sharing, or error qubits\nin terms of fault tolerance. This offers a way to extend existing MBQC patterns\nto secret sharing protocols. Our characterisation of pointless measurements is\nbelieved also to be a useful tool for further integrated measurement based\nschemes, for example in constructing fault tolerant MBQC schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2009 15:25:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2009 00:06:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
