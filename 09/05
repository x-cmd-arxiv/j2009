First, this proposal posits that the phenomenon is an apparent\nacceleration, not a real one, caused by a progressive desynchronization of the\nastronomical and the atomic clock-times, after they had been synchronized at a\nprevious instant. The desynchronization could be caused by a coupling between\nthe background gravitation and the quantum vacuum. Therefore, the standard\nargument for the incompatibility of the Pioneer acceleration and the values of\nthe planets' orbits radii cannot be applied. Second, this proposal gives\nexactly the same results for radar ranging observations as standard physics.\nHence, it cannot be in conflict with the very precise cartography of the solar\nsystem determined by NASA's Viking mission. Otherwise stated, while this\nproposal predicts apparent changes in the velocities of the spaceships and in\nthe frequencies of Doppler observations, as really observed, it does not affect\nthe values of the distances in any way whatsoever. Note that an acceleration\nbetween the astronomical and the atomic clock-times ({\\it i. e.} a progressive\ndesynchronization) can not be discarded a priori as long as we will lack a\ntheory of quantum gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Sep 2009 16:10:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-07"}

The observations in the UV are one of the\nearliest of a Type IIb supernova (SN). On approximately day four after the\nexplosion, a dramatic upturn in the u and uvw1 (lambda_c = 2600 Angstroms)\nlight curves occurred after an initial rapid decline which is attributed to\nadiabatic cooling after the initial shock breakout. This rapid decline and\nupturn is reminiscent of the Type IIb SN 1993J on day six after the explosion.\nOptical/near-IR spectra taken around the peak reveal prominent H-alpha, HeI,\nand CaII absorption lines. A fading X-ray source is also located at the\nposition of SN 2008ax, implying an interaction of the SN shock with the\nsurrounding circumstellar material and a mass-loss rate of the progenitor of\nM_dot = (9+/-3)x10^-6 solar masses per year.

Recent Spitzer observations have shown that the\nmid-infrared spectra of protoplanetary disks are covered in emission lines due\nto water and other molecules. Here, we present a non-LTE 2D radiative transfer\nmodel of water lines in the 10-36 mum range that can be used to constrain the\nabundance structure of water vapor, given an observed spectrum, and show that\nan assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) does not accurately\nestimate the physical conditions of the water vapor emission zones. By applying\nthe model to published Spitzer spectra we find that: 1) most water lines are\nsubthermally excited, 2) the gas-to-dust ratio must be one to two orders of\nmagnitude higher than the canonical interstellar medium ratio of 100-200, and\n3) the gas temperature must be higher than the dust temperature, and 4) the\nwater vapor abundance in the disk surface must be truncated beyond ~ 1 AU. A\nlow efficiency of water formation below ~ 300 K may naturally result in a lower\nwater abundance beyond a certain radius. However, we find that chemistry, may\nnot be sufficient to produce an abundance drop of many orders of magnitude and\nspeculate that the depletion may also be caused by vertical turbulent diffusion\nof water vapor from the superheated surface to regions below the snow line,\nwhere the water can freeze out and be transported to the midplane as part of\nthe general dust settling. Such a vertical cold finger effect is likely to be\nefficient due to the lack of a replenishment mechanism of large, water-ice\ncoated dust grains to the disk surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Sep 2009 22:46:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

The carbon, nitrogen and oxygen abundances rely on molecular lines\nwhich form in the outer layers of the stellar atmosphere. It is known that\nconvection in metal-poor stars induces very low temperatures which are not\npredicted by `classical' 1D stellar atmospheres. To obtain the correct\ntemperature structure, one needs full 3D hydrodynamical models. Using CO5BOLD\n3D hydrodynamical model atmospheres and the Linfor3D line formation code,\nmolecular lines of CH, NH, OH and C2 were computed, and 3D carbon, nitrogen and\noxygen abundances were determined. The resulting carbon abundances were\ncompared to abundances derived using atomic CI lines in 1D LTE and NLTE. There\nis not a good agreement between the carbon abundances determined from C2 bands\nand from the CH band, and molecular lines do not agree with the atomic CI\nlines. Although this may be partly due to uncertainties in the transition\nprobabilities of the molecular bands it certainly has to do with the\ntemperature structure of the outer layers of the adopted model atmosphere. We\nexplore the influence of the 3D model properties on the molecular abundance\ndetermination. In particular, the choice of the number of opacity bins used in\nthe model calculations and its subsequent effects on the temperature structure\nand molecular line formation is discussed.

In this paper, we study diversity multiplexing\ntradeoff for both FDD and TDD systems, when both receiver and transmitter\nknowledge about the channel is noisy and potentially mismatched. For FDD\nsystems, we first extend the achievable tradeoff region for 1.5 rounds of\nmessage passing to get higher diversity compared to the best known scheme, in\nthe regime of higher multiplexing gains. We then break the mold of all current\nchannel state based protocols by using multiple rounds of conferencing to\nextract more bits about the actual channel. This iterative refinement of the\nchannel increases the diversity order with every round of communication. The\nprotocols are on-demand in nature, using high powers for training and feedback\nonly when the channel is in poor states. The key result is that the diversity\nmultiplexing tradeoff with perfect training and K levels of perfect feedback\ncan be achieved, even when there are errors in training the receiver and errors\nin the feedback link, with a multi-round protocol which has K rounds of\ntraining and K-1 rounds of binary feedback.

For TDD systems, we also\ndevelop new achievable strategies with multiple rounds of communication between\nthe transmitter and the receiver, which use the reciprocity of the forward and\nthe feedback channel.

By using the\n\"two-dimensional map\" of the cosmic ray intensity produced after removing the\ncontribution from the diurnal anisotropy, we succeed in extracting clear\nsignatures of the precursor. A striking feature of this event is that a weak\nloss-cone signature is first recorded more than a day prior to the Storm Sudden\nCommencement (SSC) onset. This suggests that the loss-cone precursor appeared\nonly 7 hours after the Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) eruption from the Sun, when\nthe Interplanetary (IP) shock driven by the Interplanetary Coronal Mass\nEjection (ICME) located at 0.4 AU from the Sun. We find the precursor being\nsuccessively observed with multiple detectors in the network according to the\nEarth's spin and confirmed that the precursor continuously exists in space. The\nlong lead time (15.6 hours) of this precursor which is almost twice the typical\nvalue indicates that the IMF was more quiet in this event than a typical power\nspectrum assumed for the IMF turbulence. The amplitude (-6.45 %) of the\nloss-cone anisotropy at the SSC onset is more than twice the FD size,\nindicating that the maximum intensity depression behind the IP shock is much\nlarger than the FD size recorded at the Earth in this event. We also find the\nexcess intensity from the sunward IMF direction clearly observed during ~10\nhours preceding the SSC onset.

In this model the propagation of a linearly polarized laser beam\nin the external transverse magnetic field is considered. It was shown that\nthere is the effect of vacuum birefringence, and we evaluate induced\nellipticity. The upper bounds on the combination of parameters introduced from\nthe experimental data of BRST and PVLAS Collaborations were obtained. When two\nparameters are equal to each other, we arrive at Born--Infeld electrodynamics\nand the effect of vacuum birefringence vanishes. We find the canonical and\nsymmetrical Belinfante energy-momentum tensors. The trace of the\nenergy-momentum tensor is not zero and the dilatation symmetry is broken. The\nfour-divergence of the dilatation current is equal to the trace of the\nBelinfante energy-momentum tensor and is proportional to the parameter (with\nthe dimension of the field strength) of the model.

It is\noften believed that Hawking's argument is not precisely formulated, and a more\ncareful accounting of naturally occurring quantum corrections will allow the\nradiation process to become unitary. We show that such is not the case, by\nproving that small corrections to the leading order Hawking computation cannot\nremove the entanglement between the radiation and the hole. We formulate\nHawking's argument as a `theorem': assuming `traditional' physics at the\nhorizon and usual assumptions of locality we will be forced into mixed states\nor remnants. We also argue that one cannot explain away the problem by invoking\nAdS/CFT duality. We conclude with recent results on the quantum physics of\nblack holes which show the the interior of black holes have a `fuzzball'\nstructure. This nontrivial structure of microstates resolves the information\nparadox, and gives a qualitative picture of how classical intuition can break\ndown in black hole physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Sep 2009 15:44:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2011 19:57:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-26"}
