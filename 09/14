Further, our spatially-resolved images should assist in\ncharacterizing the particular solar surface regions associated with TSI\nvariations. Also, since the particular set of MWO data on which this analysis\nis based is available on a daily basis back to at least 1985, and on an\nintermittent basis before then, it will be possible to estimate the TSI\nemission due to identified solar surface features at several solar minima to\nconstrain the role surface magnetic effects have on long-term trends in solar\nenergy output.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2009 01:43:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The ISM also\ncontains neutral hydrogen which has a well known resonance at 1420.4 MHz.\nElectro-magnetic theory predicts that at such a resonance, the induced\ndispersive effects will be drastically different from those of the free\nelectrons. Pulses traveling through a cloud of neutral hydrogen should undergo\n\"anomalous dispersion\", which causes the group velocity of the medium to be\nlarger than the speed of light in vacuum. This superluminal group velocity\ncauses pulses containing frequencies near the resonance to arrive earlier in\ntime with respect to other pulses. Hence, these pulses appear to travel faster\nthan light. This phenomenon is caused by an interplay between the time scales\npresent in the pulse and the time scales present in the medium.

Results are obtained using techniques from Karlin (1982)\nthat overcome the weak selection constraints needed for tractability in prior\nstudies of multilocus event models. A multivariate form of the reduction\nprinciple is found: reduction results at individual loci combine topologically\nto produce a surface of mutation rate alterations that are neutral for a new\nmodifier allele. New mutation rates survive if and only if they fall below this\nsurface - a generalization of the hyperplane found by Zhivotovsky et al. (1994)\nfor a multilocus recombination modifier. Increases in mutation rates at some\nloci may evolve if compensated for by decreases at other loci. The strength of\nselection on the modifier scales in proportion to the number of germline cell\ndivisions, and increases with the number of loci affected. Loci that do not\nmake a difference to marginal fitnesses at equilibrium are not subject to the\nreduction principle, and under fine tuning of mutation rates would be expected\nto have higher mutation rates than loci in mutation-selection balance. Other\nresults include the nonexistence of 'viability analogous, Hardy-Weinberg'\nmodifier polymorphisms under multiplicative mutation, and the sufficiency of\naverage transmission rates to encapsulate the effect of modifier polymorphisms\non the transmission of loci under selection. A conjecture is offered regarding\nsituations, like recombination in the presence of mutation, that exhibit\ndepartures from the reduction principle. Constraints for tractability are:\ntight linkage of all loci, initial fixation at the modifier locus, and mutation\ndistributions comprising transition probabilities of reversible Markov chains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2009 00:33:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2010 22:26:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 19 Aug 2010 01:14:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-04"}

The method was tested using simulated\ndata as well as archived observations made with the WSRT at wavelengths of 92\nand 21 cm. The drifting subpulse phenomenon is a well known property of radio\npulsars. However the properties of the temporal behaviour of drifting subpulses\nare not fully explored. The drifting can also be non-coherent and the presence\nof effects like nulling or drift rate changing can mask the drifting behaviour\nof the pulsar. The S2DFS is a robust method for investigating this phenomenon\nand by introducing it we aim to expand our knowledge of the temporal drifting\nsubpulse properties. Our new analysis method uses horizonally collapsed\nfluctuation spectra obtained with the Two-Dimensional Fluctuation Spectrum\nmethod. Stacking the collapsed spectra obtained in a 256 pulse window which\nslides by a pulse at a time produces a map of the collapsed fluctuation\nspectrum. By analysing the maps one can easily determine the presence of any\ntemporal drift changes. Simulated data showed that the technique can reveal the\npresence of any temporal changes in drift behaviour like mode changing or\nnulling. We have also analysed data of three pulsars, PSRs B0031-07, B1819-22\nand B1944+17, which were selected based on the quality of the data and their\nknown drift properties.

We aim here to contribute to the identification of unassociated bright\nsources of gamma-rays in the recently released catalogue obtained by the Fermi\ncollaboration.\n  Methods. Our work is based on a extensive cross-identification of sources\nfrom different wavelength catalogues and databases.\n  Results. As a first result, we report the finding of a few counterpart\ncandidates inside the 95% confidence error box of the Fermi LAT unidentified\ngamma-ray source 0FGL J1848.6$-$0138. The globular cluster GLIMPSE-C01\nremarkably stands out among the most peculiar objects consistent with the\nposition uncertainty of the gamma-ray source and with a conceivable physical\nscenario for gamma-ray production. The Fermi observed spectrum is compared\nagainst theoretical predictions in the literature making the association\nplausible but not yet certain due to its low X-ray to gamma-ray luminosity\nratio. Other competing counterparts are also discussed. In particular, we pay a\nspecial attention to a possible Pulsar Wind Nebula inside the Fermi error box\nwhose nature is yet to be confirmed.\n  Conclusions.Both a globular cluster and an infrared source resembling a\nPulsar Wind Nebula have been found in positional agreement with 0FGL\nJ1848.6$-$0138. In addition, other interesting objects in the field are also\nreported. Future gamma-ray observations will narrow the position uncertainty\nand we hope to eventually confirm one of the counterpart candidates reported\nhere. If GLIMPSE-C01 is confirmed, together with the Fermi possible detection\nof the well known globular cluster 47 Tuc, then it would provide strong support\nto theoretical predictions of globular clusters as gamma-ray sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2009 11:34:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

We first present the diagrammatic formulation of the technique in\nQCD, deriving at one loop the gauge independent gluon self-energy, quark-gluon\nvertex, and three-gluon vertex, together with their Abelian Ward identities.\nThe generalization to theories with spontaneous symmetry breaking is carried\nout in detail, and the connection with the optical theorem and the dispersion\nrelations are explained within the electroweak sector of the Standard Model.\nThe equivalence between the PT and the Feynman gauge of the Background Field\nMethod (BFM) is elaborated, and the crucial differences between the two methods\nare critically scrutinized. The Batalin-Vilkovisky quantization method and the\ngeneral formalism of algebraic renormalization are introduced, and the\nall-order generalization of the PT is thoroughly examined. The extension of the\nPT to the non-perturbative domain of the QCD Schwinger-Dyson equations is\npresented systematically, and the main advantages of the resulting\nself-consistent truncation scheme are discussed. A plethora of physical\napplications relying on the PT are reviewed, such as the definition of\ngauge-independent off-shell form-factors, the construction of non-Abelian\neffective charges, the gauge-invariant treatment of resonant transition\namplitudes and unstable particles, and the dynamical generation of an effective\ngluon mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2009 12:58:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-15"}

Such delays are expected to lead to non trivial\nstability issues and lack of robustness of control solutions. However, such\ndifficulties are not observed in biological systems under normal operating\nconditions. Based on early suggestions in the control literature, a possible\nsolution to this conundrum has been the suggestion that the motor system\ncontains within itself a forward model of the plant (e.g., the arm), which\nallows the system to `simulate' and predict the effect of applying a control\nsignal. In this work we formally define the notion of a forward model for\ndeterministic control problems, and provide simple conditions that imply its\nexistence for tasks involving delayed feedback control. As opposed to previous\nwork which dealt mostly with linear plants and quadratic cost functions, our\nresults apply to rather generic control systems, showing that any controller\n(biological or otherwise) which solves a set of tasks, \\emph{must} contain\nwithin itself a forward plant model. We suggest that our results provide strong\ntheoretical support for the necessity of forward models in many delayed control\nproblems, implying that they are not only useful, but rather, mandatory, under\ngeneral conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2009 13:01:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-15"}

In general, the mass of a hot subdwarf is derived with\nasteroseismology or dynamical methods, for which it is often difficult to\nobtain the necessary data from observations. We intend to find an approach to\nderiving the masses of hot subdwarfs from observational data in the literature.\nWe presented full evolutionary calculations for hot subdwarfs in a wide mass\nrange (0.33 $M_\\odot$ to 1.4 $M_\\odot$) for a Population I metallicity of\n$Z$=0.02, and obtained a relation between $M_{\\rm p}$ and $\\log (\\frac{T_{\\rm\neff}^4}{g})$, where $M_{\\rm p}$, $T_{\\rm eff}$, and $g$ are the most probable\nmass, effective temperature, and gravity. This relation is used to study the\nmasses of some observed hot subdwarfs. We proposed a method of determining the\nmasses of hot subdwarfs. Using this method, we studied the masses of hot\nsubdwarfs from the ESO supernova Ia progenitor survey and Hamburg quasar\nsurvey. The study shows that most of subdwarf B stars have masses between 0.42\nand 0.54 $M_\\odot$, whilst most sdO stars are in the range 0.40 $\\sim$ 0.55\n$M_\\odot$. Comparing our study to the theoretical mass distributions of Han et\nal.

In the special\ncase when the theory admits a unique maximally symmetric solution, apart from\nthe mass and the angular momentum, the black hole is described by an\nindependent \"gravitational hair\" parameter, which provides a negative lower\nbound for the mass. This bound is saturated at the extremal case and, since the\ntemperature and the semiclassical entropy vanish, it is naturally regarded as\nthe ground state. The absence of a global charge associated with the\ngravitational hair parameter reflects through the first law of thermodynamics\nin the fact that the variation of this parameter can be consistently reabsorbed\nby a shift of the global charges, giving further support to consider the\nextremal case as the ground state. The rotating black hole fits within relaxed\nasymptotic conditions as compared with the ones of Brown and Henneaux, such\nthat they are invariant under the standard asymptotic symmetries spanned by two\ncopies of the Virasoro generators, and the algebra of the conserved charges\nacquires a central extension. Then it is shown that Strominger's holographic\ncomputation for general relativity can also be extended to the BHT theory;\ni.e., assuming that the quantum theory could be consistently described by a\ndual conformal field theory at the boundary, the black hole entropy can be\nmicroscopically computed from the asymptotic growth of the number of states\naccording to Cardy's formula, in exact agreement with the semiclassical result.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2009 15:03:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-25"}

We then compute the Ashtekar variables for a\nslightly simplified torus such that the Gauss constraint can be solved easily.\nWe perform a canonical transformation so that the holomies along the edges of\nthe torus reduce to a product between almost and strictly periodic functions of\nthe new variables. The drawback of this transformation is that the components\nof the densitized triad become complicated functions of these variables.\nNevertheless we find two ways of quantizing these components, which in both\ncases leads surprisingly to a continuous spectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2009 15:34:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-15"}

In this paper I review our current\nunderstanding of these topics. I begin by considering whether AGN and BHBs show\nthe same X-ray spectral-timing `states' (e.g. low-flux, hard-spectrum or `hard'\nand high-flux, soft-spectrum or `soft'). Observational selection effects mean\nthat most of the AGN which we have monitored will probably be `soft state'\nobjects, but AGN are found in the other BHB states, although possibly with\ndifferent critical transition accretion rates. I examine timescale scaling\nrelationships between AGN and BHBs. I show that characteristic power spectral\n`bend' timescales, T_B, scale approximately with black hole mass, M_BH, but\ninversely with accretion rate, mdot_E, (in units of the Eddington accretion\nrate) probably signifying that T_B, arises at the inner edge of the accretion\ndisc. The relationship T_B proportional to M_BH/mdot_E is a good fit, implying\nthat no other potential variable, e.g. black hole spin, varies significantly.\nLags between hard and soft X-ray bands as a function of Fourier timescale\nfollow similar patterns in AGN and BHBs.

We then present a brief summary of the classical Blandford-Znajek\nmechanism and its conceptual foundations. Recently, it has become possible to\nstudy these effects in much greater detail using numerical simulation. After\ndiscussing which aspects of the problem can be handled well by numerical means\nand which aspects remain beyond the grasp of such methods, we summarize their\nresults so far. Simulations have confirmed that processes akin to the classical\nBlandford-Znajek mechanism can launch powerful electromagnetically-dominated\njets, and have shown how the jet luminosity can be related to black hole spin\nand concurrent accretion rate. However, they have also shown that the\nluminosity and variability of jets can depend strongly on magnetic field\ngeometry. We close with a discussion of several important open questions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2009 15:37:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

In contrast to the\nconsensus of the last decade, we show that the time derivative of the\ncosmological scale factor, is a constant. We derive H(z), the Hubble parameter,\nas a function of the redshift, z. Based on H(z), we derive a curve of the\nDistance Modulus versus log(z). This curve fits data from supernovae\nobservations, without any free parameters. This fit is as good as that obtained\nby current cosmology, which needs the free parameters Omega_M and Omega_Lambda.\nWe obtain these results by using the hitherto un-noticed fact that the global\ngravitational energy density in our Hubble Sphere (HS) is equal to the\nCosmological Microwave Background (CMB) energy density. We derive the dynamic\nand kinematic relations that govern the motions of celestial bodies in and\naround galaxies. This derivation does not require any gravitating matter beyond\nthe observed baryonic matter. The theoretical Rotation Curves (RC), resulting\nfrom these relations, fit observed RCs. We obtain these results by examining\nthe interplay between the local gravitational energy density, around a galaxy,\nand the CMB energy density. This interplay causes the inhomogeneous and\nanisotropic space expansion around a galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2009 15:38:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-15"}

The necessary ingredients for a compact object of stellar\nmass to qualify as a microquasar seem to be: accretion, rotation and magnetic\nfield. The presence of a black hole may help, but is not strictly required,\nsince neutron star X-ray binaries and dwarf novae can be powerful jet sources\nas well. The above issues are broadly discussed throughout this Chapter, with a\na rather trivial question in mind: why do we care? In other words: are jets a\nnegligible phenomenon in terms of accretion power, or do they contribute\nsignificantly to dissipating gravitational potential energy? How do they\ninfluence their surroundings? The latter point is especially relevant in a\nbroader context, as there is mounting evidence that outflows powered by\nsuper-massive black holes in external galaxies may play a crucial role in\nregulating the evolution of cosmic structures. Microquasars can also be thought\nof as a form of quasars for the impatient: what makes them appealing, despite\ntheir low number statistics with respect to quasars, are the fast variability\ntime-scales. In the first approximation, the physics of the jet-accretion\ncoupling in the innermost regions should be set by the mass/size of the\naccretor: stellar mass objects vary on 10^5-10^8 times shorter time-scales,\nmaking it possible to study variable accretion modes and related ejection\nphenomena over average Ph.D. time-scales.
