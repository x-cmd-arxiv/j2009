Non-passive red early-type galaxies (REGs) have larger\nmetallicity and younger age than passive REGs, which implies that non-passive\nREGs have suffered recent SF adding young and metal-rich stars to them. The\nradio detection fraction of REGs strongly depends on their optical absolute\nmagnitudes, while that of most late-type galaxies does not, implying the\ndifference in their radio sources: AGN and SF. The UV - optical colours and the\nradio detection fraction of passive RLGs show that they have properties similar\nto REGs rather than non-passive RLGs. Dust extinction may not be a dominant\nfactor making RLGs red, because RLGs are detected in the mid- and far-infrared\nbands less efficiently than blue late-type galaxies (BLGs).

Over the past several years, a number of supernova identification\nschemes have been proposed that rely on photometric information only. Some of\nthese schemes use color-color or color-magnitude diagrams; others simply fit\nsupernova data to models. Both of these approaches suffer a number of drawbacks\npartially addressed in the so-called Bayesian-based supernova classification\ntechniques. However, Bayesian techniques are also problematic in that they\ntypically require that the supernova candidate be one of a known set of\nsupernova types. This presents a number of problems, the most obvious of which\nis that there are bound to be objects that do not conform to any presently\nknown model in large supernova candidate samples. We propose a new photometric\nclassification scheme that uses a Bayes factor based on color in order to\nidentify supernovae by type. This method does not require knowledge of the\ncomplete set of possible astronomical objects that could mimic a supernova\nsignal. Further, as a Bayesian approach, it accounts for all systematic and\nstatistical uncertainties of the measurements in a single step. To illustrate\nthe use of the technique, we apply it to a simulated dataset for a possible\nfuture large-scale space-based Joint Dark Energy Mission and demonstrate how it\ncould be used to identify Type Ia supernovae. The method's utility in\npre-selecting and ranking supernova candidates for possible spectroscopic\nfollow-up -- i.e., its usage as a supernova trigger -- will be briefly\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Sep 2009 19:37:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-22"}

In this picture probability is a bi-valuation\ndefined on a lattice of statements that quantifies the degree to which one\nstatement implies another. The sum rule is a constraint equation that ensures\nthat valuations are assigned so as to not violate associativity of the lattice\njoin and meet.

Given that a\nprecise measurement of the scattering polarization profile of the lithium\ndoublet lies at the limit of the present observational possibilities, it is\nworthwhile to clarify the physical origin of the observed polarization, its\ndiagnostic potential and what kind of Q/I shapes can be expected from theory.\nTo this end, we have applied the quantum theory of atomic level polarization\ntaking into account the hyperfine structure of the two stable isotopes of\nlithium, as well as the Hanle effect of a microturbulent magnetic field of\narbitrary strength. We find that quantum interferences between the sublevels\npertaining to the upper levels of the D_2 and D_1 line transitions of lithium\ndo not cause any observable effect on the emergent Q/I profile. Our theoretical\ncalculations show that only two Q/I peaks can be expected, with the strongest\none caused by the D_2 line of ^7Li I and the weakest one due to the D_2 line of\n^6Li I. Interestingly, we find that these two peaks in the theoretical Q/I\nprofile stand out clearly only when the kinetic temperature of the thin\natmospheric region that produces the emergent spectral line radiation is lower\nthan 4000 K. The fact that such region is located around a height of 200 km in\nstandard semi-empirical models, where the kinetic temperature is about 5000 K,\nleads us to suggest that the most likely Q/I profile produced by the sun in the\nlithium doublet should be slightly asymmetric and dominated by the ^7Li I peak.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2009 13:06:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

The entropy profiles are robustly measured at least out to\nR_1000 in all systems and out to R_500 in 13 systems. Compared to theoretical\nexpectations, the observed distributions show a radial and mass-dependent\nexcess entropy that is greater and extends to larger radii in lower mass\nsystems. At R_500, the mass dependence and entropy excess are both negligible\nwithin the uncertainties. Mirroring this behaviour, the scaling of gas entropy\nis shallower than self-similar in the inner regions, but steepens with radius,\nbecoming consistent with self-similar at R_500. The dispersion in scaled\nentropy in the inner regions is linked to the presence of cool cores and\ndynamical activity; at larger radii the dispersion decreases by a factor of two\nand the dichotomy between subsamples disappears. Parameterising the profiles\nwith a power law plus constant model, there are two peaks in central entropy\nK_0; however, we cannot distinguish between a bimodal or a left-skewed\ndistribution. The outer slopes are correlated with system temperature; their\ndistribution is unimodal with a median value of 0.98. Renormalising the\ndimensionless entropy profiles by the gas mass fraction profile f_gas(< R),\nleads to a remarkable reduction in the scatter, implying that gas mass fraction\nvariations with radius and mass are the cause of the observed entropy\nproperties. We discuss a tentative scenario to explain the behaviour of the\nentropy and gas mass fraction in the REXCESS sample, in which extra heating and\nmerger mixing maintains an elevated central entropy level in the majority of\nthe population, and a smaller fraction of systems develops a cool core.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2009 14:02:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2009 12:35:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-22"}

LID causes levitation of an isotope with a red-shifted spectral line\nand sinking of an isotope with a blue-shifted line, generating thus diffusive\nseparation of isotopes. We have studied diffusion of mercury as a typical\nwell-studied isotope-rich heavy metal.
