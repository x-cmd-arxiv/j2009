For an isopedic magnetic field in a gas\ndisc, the ratio f between the DM and baryon potentials depends strongly on the\nmagnetic field strength.

The data has been reduced homogeneously. Our overriding goal is to\nlearn the properties of the ensemble of comets. More than 30 parameters are\nlisted, of which over ~20 are new and measured from the plots. We define two\nages for a comet using activity as a proxy, the photometric age P-AGE, and the\ntime-age, T-AGE. It is shown that these two parameters are robust, implying\nthat the input data can have significant errors but P-AGE and T-AGE come out\nwith small errors. This is due to their mathematical definition. It is shown\nthat P-AGE classifies comets by shape of their light curve. The value of this\nAtlas is twofold: The SLCs not only show what we know, but also show what we do\nnot know, thus pointing the way to meaningful observations. Besides their\nscientific value, these plots are useful for planning observations. The SLCs\nhave not been modeled, and there is no cometary light curve standard model as\nthere is for some variable stars (i.e. eclipsing binaries). Comets are\nclassified by age and size.

There\nthe main interest is to identify a small number of infected people among a\nlarge population using collective samples. In viral epidemics, one way to\nacquire collective samples is by sending agents inside the population. While in\nclassical group testing, it is assumed that the sampling procedure is fully\nknown to the reconstruction algorithm, in this work we assume that the decoder\npossesses only partial knowledge about the sampling process.

The combined data revealed a total of 30 point sources in the two primary\nmerger nuclei. Twenty-five of these are found in the northeastern nucleus\n(component \"A\"=IC 694) over a region ~100 pc in diameter, while five are in the\nsouthwestern nucleus (component \"B1\"=NGC 3690) within a region ~30 pc in size.\nThese objects are interpreted as young supernovae and supernova remnants; the\nratio of the source counts in nuclei A and B1 is approximately equal to the\nratio of their predicted supernova rates. An approximate luminosity function\nhas been derived for nucleus A, and indicates that it might contain as many as\n500-1000 compact radio sources more powerful than Cas A; the integrated flux\ndensity of these sources would be about 20% of the total flux density seen at\nlower resolution. A new supernova occurred in nucleus B1 in the first half of\n2005, having a peak radio power at least 2,000 times the present power of\nCassiopeia A. This supernova is located within 0.4 pc (projected distance) of\nan apparently older supernova remnant, making it very likely that this\nindicates the presence of a massive super star cluster within nucleus B1.\nComparison of the typical radio flux densities of our compact radio sources to\nthe observed X-ray luminosities of nuclei A and B1 indicates that it is\npossible that one radio source in each nucleus actually could be associated\nwith an active galactic nucleus rather than being a supernova remnant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2009 21:06:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

In the Curie-Weiss regime (x >= 0.40), on the other\nhand, various phase transitions are observed. For x = 0.40, a susceptibility\nhump is seen at 30 K, suggesting the onset of static AF order. A magnetic jump,\nwhich is likely to be triggered by charge ordering, is clearly observed at Tt =\n175 K in samples with x = 0.50 (= 1/2) and 0.67 (= 2/3), while only a tiny kink\nappears at T = 210 K in the sample with an intermediate Li composition, x =\n0.60. Thus, the phase diagram of the LixCoO2 system is complex, and the\nelectronic properties are sensitively influenced by the Li content (x).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Sep 2009 04:14:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 17 Oct 2009 02:18:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-17"}

A scanning near field microwave\nmicroscope probes a sample and acquires data in the form of the frequency and\nquality factor shifts of a resonant cavity coupled to the sample.

Cavity perturbation theory\nconnects the measured frequency shifts to changes in the computed energy stored\nin the electromagnetic field.

The\nusual description of the color superconducting state violates color\nsinglet-ness. On the other hand, the color superconducting state here proposed,\nis color symmetric in the sense that an arbitrary color rotation leads to an\nequivalent state, with precisely the same physical properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Sep 2009 15:19:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-10"}

The purpose of this article is to make available\nto the linguistic community the standard mathematical definition of recursion\nand to apply it to discuss linguistic recursion. As a byproduct, we obtain an\ninsight into certain \"soft universals\" of human languages, which are related to\ncognitive constructs necessary to implement mathematical reasoning, i.e.\nmathematical model theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Sep 2009 15:38:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-22"}

We solve the\nSchrodinger equation within the Hartree type mean field approximation using\nThomas Fermi Poisson nonlinear screening theory. We observe that the two\ndimensional electron system splits into compressible and incompressible regions\nfor certain magnetic field intervals, where the Hall resistance is quantized\nand the longitudinal resistance vanishes, if an external current is imposed. We\nfound that the strong current imposed, induces an asymmetry on the IS width\ndepending linearly on the current intensity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Sep 2009 15:47:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2009 10:47:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}
