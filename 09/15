By\ncomparing these images of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field with the ACS z'-band\n(0.85micron), we identify objects with red colours, (z'-Y)_AB>1.3), consistent\nwith the Ly-alpha forest absorption at z~6.7-8.8. We identify 12 of these\nz'-drops down to a limiting magnitude Y_AB<28.5 (equivalent to a star formation\nrate of 1.3M_sun/yr at z=7.1), which are undetected in the other ACS filters.\nWe use the WFC3 J-band image to eliminate contaminant low mass Galactic stars,\nwhich typically have redder colours than z~7 galaxies. One of our z'-drops is a\nprobably a T-dwarf star. The z~7 z'-drops have much bluer spectral slopes than\nLyman-break galaxies at lower redshift. Our brightest z'-drop is not present in\nthe NICMOS J-band image of the same field taken 5 years before, and is a\npossible transient object. From the 10 remaining z~7 candidates we determine a\nlower limit on the star formation rate density of 0.0017M_sun/yr/Mpc^3 for a\nSalpeter initial mass function, which rises to 0.0025-0.0034M_sun/yr/Mpc^3\nafter correction for luminosity bias. The star formation rate density is a\nfactor of ~10 less than that at z=3-4, and is about half the value at z~6.\nWhile based on a single deep field, our results suggest that this star\nformation rate density would produce insufficient Lyman continuum photons to\nreionize the Universe unless the escape fraction of these photons is extremely\nhigh (f_esc>0.5), and the clumping factor of the Universe is low. Even then, we\nneed to invoke a large contribution from galaxies below our detection limit.\nThe apparent shortfall in ionizing photons might be alleviated if stellar\npopulations at high redshift are low metallicity or have a top-heavy IMF.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2009 19:58:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2009 20:03:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2009 20:21:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

We show by\nrigorous bounds, physical arguments and numerical simulations that the spectral\nSGS flux is dominated by local triadic interactions in an extended turbulent\ninertial-range. Inter-band energy transfers are also shown to be dominated by\nlocal triads if the spectral bands have constant width on a logarithmic scale.\nWe disprove in particular an alternative picture of ``local transfer by\nnonlocal triads,'' with the advecting wavenumber mode at the energy peak.\nAlthough such triads have the largest transfer rates of all {\\it individual}\nwavenumber triads, we show rigorously that, due to their restricted number,\nthey make an asymptotically negligible contribution to energy flux and\nlog-banded energy transfers at high wavenumbers in the inertial-range. We show\nthat it is only the aggregate effect of a geometrically increasing number of\nlocal wavenumber triads which can sustain an energy cascade to small scales.\nFurthermore, non-local triads are argued to contribute even less to the\nspace-average energy flux than is implied by our rigorous bounds, because of\nadditional cancellations from scale-decorrelation effects. We can thus recover\nthe -4/3 scaling of nonlocal contributions to spectral energy flux predicted by\nKraichnan's ALHDIA and TFM closures. We support our results with numerical data\nfrom a $512^3$ pseudospectral simulation of isotropic turbulence with\nphase-shift dealiasing.

Most important are the imperfectly subtracted seeing halos of\nneighboring stars, residual image distortions and unrecognized confusion of the\ntarget source with fainter sources in the background. Further contributors to\nthe error budget are the uncertainty in estimating the point spread function,\nthe signal-to-noise ratio induced statistical uncertainty, coordinate\ntransformation errors, the chromaticity of refraction in Earth's atmosphere,\nthe post adaptive optics differential tilt jitter and anisoplanatism. For stars\nas bright as mK=14, residual image distortions limit the astrometry, for\nfainter stars the limitation is set by the seeing halos of the surrounding\nstars. In order to improve the astrometry substantially at the current\ngeneration of telescopes, an adaptive optics system with high performance and\nweak seeing halos over a relatively small field (r<=3\") is suited best.\nFurthermore, techniques to estimate or reconstruct the seeing halo could be\npromising.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2009 16:56:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

A standard but heuristic procedure is to use the flux of (components\nof) the wave function in a WKB approximation. This gives sensible semiclassical\nresults but lacks an underlying operator formalism. In this paper, we address\nthe issue of constructing probability distributions linked to the\nWheeler-DeWitt equation using the decoherent histories approach to quantum\ntheory. We show that the appropriate class operators (the generalization of\nstrings of projectors) in quantum cosmology are readily constructed using a\ncomplex potential. We derive the class operator for entering or not entering\none or more regions in configuration space. They commute with the Hamiltonian,\nhave a sensible classical limit and are closely related to intersection number\noperators. We show that oscillatory WKB solutions to the Wheeler-DeWitt\nequation give approximate decoherence of histories, as do superpositions of WKB\nsolutions, as long as the regions of configuration space are sufficiently\nlarge. The corresponding probabilities coincide, in a semiclassical\napproximation, with standard heuristic procedures.

Experiments have been\nperformed in a channel mounted in the large-scale 'Coriolis' rotating platform,\nand measurements have been carried out in the planes normal and parallel to the\nrotation axis using particle image velocimetry. After a short period of about\n0.4 tank rotation where the energy decays as $t^{-6/5}$, as in classical\nisotropic turbulence, the energy follows a shallower decay law compatible with\n$t^{-3/5}$, as dimensionally expected for energy transfers governed by the\nlinear timescale $\\Omega^{-1}$. The crossover occurs at a Rossby number $Ro\n\\simeq 0.25$, without noticeable dependence with the grid Rossby number. After\nthis transition, anisotropy develops in the form of vertical layers where the\ninitial vertical velocity remains trapped. These layers of nearly constant\nvertical velocity become thinner as they are advected and stretched by the\nlarge-scale horizontal flow, producing significant horizontal gradient of\nvertical velocity which eventually become unstable. After the $Ro \\simeq 0.25$\ntransition, the vertical vorticity field first develops a cyclone-anticyclone\nasymmetry, reproducing the growth law of the vorticity skewness, $S_\\omega(t)\n\\simeq (\\Omega t)^{0.7}$, reported by Morize, Moisy & Rabaud [{\\it Phys.\nFluids} {\\bf 17} (9), 095105 (2005)].

The present results indicate\nthat the shear instability of the vertical layers contribute significantly to\nthe re-symmetrisation of the vertical vorticity at large time, by re-injecting\nvorticity fluctuations of random sign at small scales.

This chapter aims at establishing\nconnections between certain quantum information protocols and foundational\nissues in quantum theory. After a brief discusion of the most common\nmisinterpretations of Bell's theorem and a discussion of what its real meaning\nis, it will be demonstrated how quantum contextuality and violations of local\nrealism can be used as useful resources in quantum information applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2009 18:25:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-15"}

We find that the predicted epicyclic overdensities arise in any\ntidal tail no matter which orbit the cluster follows as long as the cluster\nlives long enough for the overdensities to build up.\n  The distance of the overdensities along the tidal tail from the cluster\ncentre depends for circular orbits only on the mass of the cluster and the\nstrength of the tidal field, and therefore decreases monotonically with time,\nwhile for eccentric orbits the orbital motion influences the distance, causing\na periodic compression and stretching of the tails and making the distance\noscillate with time. We provide an approximation for estimating the distance of\nthe overdensities in this case.\n  We describe an additional type of overdensity which arises in extended tidal\ntails of clusters on eccentric orbits, when the acceleration of the tidal field\non the stellar stream is no longer homogeneous. Moreover, we conclude that a\npericentre passage or a disk shock is not the direct origin of an overdensity\nwithin a tidal tail. Escape due to such tidal perturbations does not take place\nimmediately after the perturbation but is rather delayed and spread over the\norbit of the cluster. All observable overdensities are therefore of the\nmentioned two types.

We survey those results, and then--based on joint work with M.\nDaws--outline a proof that establishes the non-amenability of $B(\\ell^p)$ for\nall $p \\in [1,\\infty]$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2009 19:18:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2009 15:52:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2009 20:07:23 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2009 01:38:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-22"}

We discuss in detail special challenges of distortion and\nnonlinearity that must be addressed when performing PSF subtraction with data\nfrom these telescopes and their IR cameras, especially in very good seeing. We\nderive black hole masses from emission-line spectroscopy, and we calculate\naccretion rates from our K_s-band photometry, which directly samples the\nrest-frame B for these objects. We introduce a new isophotal diameter technique\nfor estimating host galaxy luminosities.

We argue that the most massive hosts plateau at <~10L*. We\nestimate the importance of selection effects on this survey and the subsequent\nlimitations of our conclusions.

We find that the X-ray light curve followed an\nexponential decay, leveling off towards its quiescent level. The exponential\ndecay timescale is ~4 days and the quiescent flux corresponds to a luminosity\nof 3x10^32 (d/7.5 kpc)^2 erg/s. This together with the relation between\nquiescent X-ray luminosity and orbital period reported in the literature\nsuggests that H1743-322 has an orbital period longer than ~10 hours. Both the\nradio and X-ray light curve show evidence for flares. The radio - X-ray\ncorrelation can be well described by a power-law with index ~0.18. This is much\nlower than the index of 0.6-0.7 found for the decay of several black hole\ntransients before. The radio spectral index measured during one of the radio\nflares while the source is in the low-hard state, is -0.5+-0.15, which\nindicates that the radio emission is optically thin. This is unlike what has\nbeen found before in black hole sources in the low-hard state. We attribute the\nradio flares and the low index for the radio - X-ray correlation to the\npresence of shocks downstream the jet flow, triggered by ejection events\nearlier in the outburst. We find no evidence for a change in X-ray power law\nspectral index during the decay, although the relatively high extinction of N_H\n=2.3x10^22 cm^-2 limits the detected number of soft photons and thus the\naccuracy of the spectral fits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2009 19:47:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Our goal is to figure out which of three giant\nplanet formation mechanisms--core accretion (with or without migration),\nscattering from the inner disk, or gravitational instability--could be\nresponsible for Fomalhaut b, HR 8799 b, c and d, and similar planets discovered\nin the future. This paper presents the results of numerical experiments\ncomparing the long-period planet formation efficiency of each possible\nmechanism in model A star, G star and M star disks.\n  First, a simple core accretion simulation shows that planet cores forming\nbeyond 35 AU cannot reach critical mass, even under the most favorable\nconditions one can construct. Second, a set of N-body simulations demonstrates\nthat planet-planet scattering does not create stable, wide-orbit systems such\nas HR 8799. Finally, a linear stability analysis verifies previous work showing\nthat global spiral instabilities naturally arise in high-mass disks. We\nconclude that massive gas giants on stable orbits with semimajor axes greater\nthan 35 AU form by gravitational instability in the disk. We recommend that\nobservers examine the planet detection rate as a function of stellar age,\ncontrolling for planet dimming with time. If planet detection rate is found to\nbe independent of stellar age, it would confirm our prediction that\ngravitational instability is the dominant mode of producing detectable planets\non wide orbits. We also predict that the occurrence ratio of long-period to\nshort-period gas giants should be highest for M dwarfs due to the inefficiency\nof core accretion and the expected small fragment mass in their disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2009 20:53:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 2009 15:46:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

The value of\nthis parameter varies greatly between species, but the cause for these\ndifferences is not entirely clear. A constraining factor of overall $RR$ in a\nspecies, which may cause increased $RR$ for smaller chromosomes, is the\nrequirement of at least one chiasma per chromosome (or chromosome-arm) per\nmeiosis. In the present study, we quantify the relative excess of recombination\nevents on smaller chromosomes by a linear regression model, which relates the\ngenetic length of chromosomes to their physical length. We find for several\nspecies that the two-parameter regression, $G= G_0 + k \\cdot P$ provides a\nbetter characterization of the relationship between genetic and physical map\nlength than the one-parameter regression that runs through the origin. A\nnon-zero intercept ($G_0$) indicates a relative excess of recombination on\nsmaller chromosomes in a genome. Given $G_0$, the parameter $k$ predicts the\nincrease of genetic map length over the increase of physical map length. The\nobserved values of $G_0$ have a similar magnitude for diverse species, whereas\n$k$ varies by two orders of magnitude. The implications of this strategy for\nthe genetic maps of human, mouse, rat, chicken, honeybee, worm and yeast are\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2009 22:26:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-16"}

We show how the low-energy sector\nof the chiral QCD Lagrangian, once embedded in a non-trivial spacetime, gives\nrise to a cosmological vacuum energy density which can be can be presented\nentirely in terms of QCD parameters and the Hubble constant $H$ as\n$\\rho_\\Lambda \\simeq H \\cdot m_q\\la\\bar{q}q\\ra /m_{\\eta'} \\sim (4.3\\cdot\n10^{-3} \\text{eV})^4$. In this work we focus on the dynamics of the ghost\nfields that are essential ingredients of the aforementioned Lagrangian. In\nparticular, we argue that the Veneziano ghost, being unphysical in the usual\nMinkowski QFT, becomes a physical degree of freedom if the universe is\nexpanding. As an immediate consequence, all relevant effects are naturally very\nsmall as they are proportional to the rate of expansion $H/ \\Lqcd \\sim\n10^{-41}$. The co-existence of these two drastically different scales ($\\Lqcd\n\\sim 100 $ MeV and $H \\sim 10^{-33}$ eV) is a direct consequence of the\nauxiliary conditions on the physical Hilbert space that are necessary to keep\nthe theory unitary. The exact cancellation taking place in Minkowski space due\nto this auxiliary condition is slightly violated when the system is upgraded to\nan expanding background. Nevertheless, this \"tiny\" effect is in fact the\ndriving force accelerating the universe today. We also derive the time\ndependent equation of state $w(t)$ for the dark energy component which tracks\nthe dynamics of the Veneziano ghost in a FLRW universe. Finally, we comment on\nhow the same physical phenomena can be recovered in Witten's approach to the\nU(1) problem when the ghost degree of freedom is not even present in the\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2009 22:39:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2009 20:57:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2009 21:00:08 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 2010 19:53:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

Using both numerical solutions of continuum\nequations to Navier-Stokes order and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we\nfind that standing waves form stripe patterns above a critical acceleration of\nthe cell. Changing the frequency of oscillation of the cell changes the\nwavelength of the resulting pattern; MD and continuum simulations both yield\nwavelengths in accord with previous experimental results. The value of the\ncritical acceleration for ordered standing waves is approximately 10% higher in\nmolecular dynamics simulations than in the continuum simulations, and the\namplitude of the waves differs significantly between the models. The delay in\nthe onset of order in molecular dynamics simulations and the amplitude of noise\nbelow this onset are consistent with the presence of fluctuations which are\nabsent in the continuum theory. The strength of the noise obtained by fit to\nSwift-Hohenberg theory is orders of magnitude larger than the thermal noise in\nfluid convection experiments, and is comparable to the noise found in\nexperiments with oscillated granular layers and in recent fluid experiments on\nfluids near the critical point. Good agreement is found between the mean field\nvalue of onset from the Swift-Hohenberg fit and the onset in continuum\nsimulations. Patterns are compared in cells oscillated at two different\nfrequencies in MD; the layer with larger wavelength patterns has less noise\nthan the layer with smaller wavelength patterns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2009 01:02:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-10"}

The link, if any, between macroscopic properties and the\nturbulent spectrum remains missing. Might it be found by contrasting the\nfrictional drag in flows with differing types of spectra? Here we perform\nunprecedented measurements of the frictional drag in soap-film flows, where the\nspectral exponent \\alpha = 3 and compare the results with the frictional drag\nin pipe flows, where the spectral exponent \\alpha = 5/3. For moderate values of\nthe Reynolds number Re (a measure of the strength of the turbulence), we find\nthat in soap-film flows the frictional drag scales as Re^{-1/2}, whereas in\npipe flows the frictional drag scales as Re^{-1/4} .

The quality of an\nancestry labeling scheme is measured by its label size, that is the maximal\nnumber of bits in a label of a tree node.\n  In addition to its theoretical appeal, the design of efficient ancestry\nlabeling schemes is motivated by applications in web search engines. For this\npurpose, even small improvements in the label size are important. In fact, the\nliterature about this topic is interested in the exact label size rather than\njust its order of magnitude. As a result, following the proposal of a simple\ninterval-based ancestry scheme with label size $2\\log_2 n$ bits (Kannan et al.,\nSTOC '88), a considerable amount of work was devoted to improve the bound on\nthe size of a label.

As a consequence, WDs of lower masses are\nusually identified as He-core remnants. However, when the initial mass of the\nprogenitor star is in between 1.8 and 3 Msun, which corresponds to the so\ncalled red giant (RGB) phase transition, the mass of the H-exhausted core at\nthe tip of the RGB is 0.3 < M_H/Msun < 0.5. Prompted by this well known result\nof stellar evolution theory, we investigate the possibility to form C-O WDs\nwith mass M < 0.5 Msun. The pre-WD evolution of stars with initial mass of\nabout 2.3 Msun, undergoing anomalous mass-loss episodes during the RGB phase\nand leading to the formation of WDs with He-rich or CO-rich cores have been\ncomputed. The cooling sequences of the resulting WDs are also described. We\nshow that the minimum mass for a C-O WD is about 0.33 Msun, so that both He and\nC-O core WDs can exist in the mass range 0.33-0.5 Msun. The models computed for\nthe present paper provide the theoretical tools to indentify the observational\ncounterpart of very low mass remnants with a C-O core among those commonly\nascribed to the He-core WD population in the progressively growing sample of\nobserved WDs of low mass. Moreover, we show that the central He-burning phase\nof the stripped progeny of the 2.3 Msun star lasts longer and longer as the\ntotal mass decreases. In particular, the M= 0.33 Msun model takes about 800 Myr\nto exhausts its central helium, which is more than three time longer than the\nvalue of the standard 2.3 Msun star: it is, by far, the longest core-He burning\nlifetime. Finally, we find the occurrence of gravonuclear instabilities during\nthe He-burning shell phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2009 08:28:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

This scenario is motivated by\nthe observational indications that the equation of state of dark energy across\nthe cosmological constant boundary is mildly favored, although the data are\nstill far from being conclusive. As a theoretical setup we introduce a no-go\ntheorem existing in quintom cosmology, and based on it we discuss the\nconditions for the equation of state of dark energy realizing the quintom\nscenario. The simplest quintom model can be achieved by introducing two scalar\nfields with one being quintessence and the other phantom. Based on the\ndouble-field quintom model we perform a detailed analysis of dark energy\nperturbations and we discuss their effects on current observations. This type\nof scenarios usually suffer from a manifest problem due to the existence of a\nghost degree of freedom, and thus we review various alternative realizations of\nthe quintom paradigm. The developments in particle physics and string theory\nprovide potential clues indicating that a quintom scenario may be obtained from\nscalar systems with higher derivative terms, as well as from non-scalar\nsystems. Additionally, we construct a quintom realization in the framework of\nbraneworld cosmology, where the cosmic acceleration and the phantom divide\ncrossing result from the combined effects of the field evolution on the brane\nand the competition between four and five dimensional gravity.

To tackle such a deconvolution\nproblem in a blind and unsupervised context, the Markov Chain Monte Carlo\n(MCMC) framework is usually adopted, and the chosen sampling scheme is most\noften the Gibbs sampler. However, such a sampling scheme fails to explore the\nstate space efficiently. Our first alternative, the $K$-tuple Gibbs sampler, is\nsimply a grouped Gibbs sampler. The second one, called partially marginalized\nsampler, is obtained by integrating the Gaussian amplitudes out of the target\ndistribution. While the mathematical validity of the first scheme is obvious as\na particular instance of the Gibbs sampler, a more detailed analysis is\nprovided to prove the validity of the second scheme.\n  For both methods, optimized implementations are proposed in terms of\ncomputation and storage cost. Finally, simulation results validate both schemes\nas more efficient in terms of convergence time compared with the plain Gibbs\nsampler. Benchmark sequence simulations show that the partially marginalized\nsampler takes fewer iterations to converge than the $K$-tuple Gibbs sampler.\nHowever, its computation load per iteration grows almost quadratically with\nrespect to the data length, while it only grows linearly for the $K$-tuple\nGibbs sampler.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2009 12:29:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2009 14:58:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-18"}

We use the first four years of public SPI data\nand extract spectra between 25 keV and 1 MeV for the 20 catalog sources\ndetected by Bouchet et al. at 200 - 600 keV with >= 2.5 sigma. In order to\nverify our analysis, we also extract spectra for the same sources from the\ncorresponding INTEGRAL/ISGRI data. We fit adequate spectral models to the\nenergy range 25-1000 keV for SPI and 25-600 keV for ISGRI. We use our spectra\nfrom the Crab (which is among the 20 sources studied here) and an empty\nlocation in a crowded field to derive an estimation of the systematic errors.\n  The agreement between our SPI and ISGRI measurements is good if we normalise\nthem on the Crab spectrum. Our SPI flux measurements also agree well with those\nby Bouchet et al. (2008). All 20 sources in our sample are detected\nindependently in the bands 25-100 keV and 100-200 keV. At 200-600 keV we detect\neight sources, at 600-1000 keV we detect two sources. Our spectra agree well\nwith the results from previous publications where available. For six of the 14\nXRBs in our sample we find evidence for a hard powerlaw-component which becomes\ndominant above the cutoff energy of the thermal Comptonization component. In\ntwo of these cases, our study provides the first indication of such emission.\nFor the others, our results confirm previous studies. Our Crab spectrum (from\n1.3 Ms exposure), shows a significant flux in all points and is well described\nby a powerlaw with a break near 100 keV and spectral indices 2.11 and 2.20.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2009 14:36:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

From the obtained polarizability, we study the screening effects\nand the collective excitations (plasmon, magneto-excitons, upper-hybrid mode\nand linear magneto-plasmons).

Such splitting of the probability amplitude into\nseveral channels is the analogue of a quantum waveguide. Thus, the appropriate\nmatching conditions for the wave function at the N/MBS interface are derived\nfrom an extension of quantum waveguide theory. Interference effects between the\ntransmitted waves inside the superconductor manifest themselves in the\nconductance. We provide results for a FeAs superconductor, in the framework of\na recently proposed effective two-band model and two recently proposed gap\nsymmetries: in the sign-reversed s-wave ($\\Delta\\cos(k_x)\\cos(k_y)$) scenario\nresonant transmission through surface Andreev bound states (ABS) at nonzero\nenergy is found as well as destructive interference effects that produce zeros\nin the conductance; in the extended s-wave ($\\Delta[\\cos(k_x)+\\cos(k_y)]$)\nscenario no ABS at finite energy are found.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2009 15:25:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

In spite of the prominent role\nthat the model has played in the development of this branch of physics, there\nstill remain some aspects of its quantization which deserve a more detailed\ndiscussion. These aspects include the kinematical resolution of the\ncosmological singularity, the precise relation between the solutions of the\ndensitized and non-densitized versions of the quantum Hamiltonian constraint,\nthe possibility of identifying superselection sectors which are as simple as\npossible, and a clear comprehension of the Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) limit\nassociated with the theory in those sectors. We propose an alternative operator\nto represent the Hamiltonian constraint which is specially suitable to deal\nwith these issues in a satisfactory way. In particular, with our constraint\noperator, the singularity decouples in the kinematical Hilbert space and can be\nremoved already at this level. Thanks to this fact, we can densitize the\nquantum Hamiltonian constraint in a rigorous manner. Besides, together with the\nphysical observables, this constraint superselects simple sectors for the\nuniverse volume, with a support contained in a single semiaxis of the real line\nand for which the basic functions that encode the information about the\ngeometry possess optimal physical properties. Namely, they provide a\nno-boundary description around the cosmological singularity and admit a\nwell-defined WDW limit in terms of standing waves. Both properties explain the\npresence of a generic quantum bounce replacing the singularity at a fundamental\nlevel, in contrast with previous studies where the bounce was proved in\nconcrete regimes and focusing on states with a marked semiclassical behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2009 15:34:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2010 08:54:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-23"}

Like Milagro, HAWC utilizes the\nwater Cherenkov technique to measure extensive air showers. Instead of a pond\nfilled with water (as in Milagro) an array of closely packed water tanks is\nused. The event direction will be reconstructed using the times when the PMTs\nin each tank are triggered. Therefore, the timing calibration will be crucial\nfor reaching an angular resolution as low as 0.25 degrees.We propose to use a\nlaser calibration system, patterned after the calibration system in Milagro.\nLike Milagro, the HAWC optical calibration system will use ~1 ns laser light\npulses. Unlike Milagro, the PMTs are optically isolated and require their own\noptical fiber calibration. For HAWC the laser light pulses will be directed\nthrough a series of optical fan-outs and fibers to illuminate the PMTs in\napproximately one half of the tanks on any given pulse. Time slewing\ncorrections will be made using neutraldensity filters to control the light\nintensity over 4 orders of magnitude.

We conjecture that the early functional peptides\nwere short (3 to 8 amino acids long), were made of those amino acids, Gly, Ala,\nVal and Asp, that are abundantly produced in many prebiotic synthesis\nexperiments and observed in meteorites, and that the neutralization of Asp's\nnegative charge is achieved by metal ions. We further assume that some traces\nof these prebiotic peptides still exist, in the form of active sites in\npresent-day proteins. Searching these proteins for prebiotic peptide candidates\nled us to identify three main classes of motifs, bound mainly to Mg^{2+} ions:\nD(F/Y)DGD corresponding to the active site in RNA polymerases, DGD(G/A)D\npresent in some kinds of mutases, and DAKVGDGD in dihydroxyacetone kinase. All\nthree motifs contain a DGD submotif, which is suggested to be the common\nancestor of all active peptides. Moreover, all three manipulate phosphate\ngroups, which was probably a very important biological function in the very\nfirst stages of life. The statistical significance of our results is supported\nby the frequency of these motifs in today's proteins, which is three times\nhigher than expected by chance, with a P-value of 3 10^{-2}. The implications\nof our findings in the context of the appearance of life and the possibility of\nan experimental validation are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2009 15:55:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-03"}
