Precursor variability in the decade before outburst indicates that\nboth of the progenitor stars were LBVs. Their pre-outburst light curves\nresemble the S Doradus phases that preceded giant eruptions of eta Carinae and\nSN1954J (V12 in NGC2403), with intermediate progenitor luminosities. HST\ndetections a decade before discovery indicate that the SN2009ip and U2773-OT\nprogenitors were supergiants with likely initial masses of 50-80 Msun and\n$\\ga$20 Msun, respectively. Both outbursts had spectra befitting known LBVs,\nalthough in different physical states. SN 2009ip exhibited a hot LBV spectrum\nwith characteristic speeds of 550 km/s, plus faster material up to 5000 km/s,\nresembling the slow Homunculus and fast blast wave of eta Carinae. U2773-OT\nshows a forest of narrow absorption and emission lines comparable to that of S\nDor in its cool state, plus [CaII] emission and an IR excess indicative of\ndust, similar to SN2008S and N300-OT. [CaII] emission is probably tied to a\ndusty pre-outburst environment, and not the outburst mechanism. SN2009ip and\nU2773-OT may provide a critical link between historical LBV eruptions, while\nU2773-OT may provide a link between LBVs and SN2008S and N300-OT.

A remarkable property of mean-field coalescent processes is that\nthey may come down from infinity, meaning that, starting with an infinite\nnumber of particles, only a finite number remains after any positive amount of\ntime, almost surely. We show here however that, in the spatial setting, on any\ninfinite and bounded-degree graph, the total number of particles will always\nremain infinite at all times, almost surely. Moreover, if G=Z^d, and the\ncoalescing mechanism is Kingman's coalescent, then starting with N particles at\nthe origin, the total number of particles remaining is of order (log* N)^d at\nany fixed positive time (where log* is the inverse tower function).

The Laplacian Lap[p,h] of p is a\npolynomial in x and in a noncommuting variable h. When all variables commute we\nhave Lap[p,h]=h^2\\Delta_x p where \\Delta_x p is the usual Laplacian. A\nsymmetric polynomial in symmetric variables will be called harmonic if\nLap[p,h]=0 and subharmonic if the polynomial q(x,h):=Lap[p,h] takes positive\nsemidefinite matrix values whenever matrices X_1,..., X_g, H are substituted\nfor the variables x_1,...,x_g, h. In this paper we classify all homogeneous\nsymmetric harmonic and subharmonic polynomials in two symmetric variables. We\nfind there are not many of them: for example, the span of all such subharmonics\nof any degree higher than 4 has dimension 2 (if odd degree) and 3 (if even\ndegree). Hopefully, the approach here will suggest ways of defining and\nanalyzing other partial differential equations and inequalities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Sep 2009 18:33:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}

Here we\nanalyze a generic model based on such type of intermittent motion, in which the\nsearcher alternates phases of slow motion allowing detection, and phases of\nfast motion without detection. We present full and systematic results for\ndifferent modeling hypotheses of the detection mechanism in space dimension 1,\n2 and 3. Our study completes and extends the results of our recent letter\n[Loverdo {\\it et al.} Nature Physics {\\bf 4}, 134 (2008)] and gives the\nnecessary calculation details. In addition, a new modeling of the detection\nphase is presented. We show that the mean target detection time can be\nminimized as a function of the mean duration of each phase in dimension 1, 2\nand 3. Importantly, this optimal strategy does not depend on the details of the\nmodeling of the slow detection phase, which shows the robustness of our\nresults. We believe that this systematic analysis can be used as a basis to\nstudy quantitatively various real search problems involving intermittent\nbehaviors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Sep 2009 18:37:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Long-range\nmagnetic-dipolar interactions are at the heart of the explanation of many\npeculiar phenomena observed in nuclear magnetic resonance, ferromagnetic\nresonance, and Bose-Einstein-condensate structures. In this paper we show that\nmagnetic-dipolar-modes (MDMs) in quasi-2D ferrite disks are characterized by\nsymmetry breaking effects. Our analysis is based on postulates about a physical\nmeaning of the magnetostatic-potential function as a complex scalar wave\nfunction, which presumes the long-range phase correlations. An important\nfeature of the MDM oscillations in a ferrite disk concerns the fact that a\nstructure with symmetric parameters and symmetric basic equations goes into\neigenstates that are not space-time symmetric. The proper solutions are found\nbased on an analysis of magnetostatic-wave propagation in a helical coordinate\nsystem. For a ferrite disk, we show that while a composition of two helical\nwaves may acquire a geometrical phase over-running of during a period, every\nseparate helical wave has a dynamical phase over-running of and so behaves as a\ndouble-valued function. We demonstrate that unique topological structures of\nthe fields in a ferrite disk are intimately related to the symmetry breaking\nproperties of MDM oscillations. The solutions give the MDM power-flow-density\nvortices with cores at the disk center and azimuthally running waves of\nmagnetization. One can expect that the proposed models of long-range ordered\nphases and space-time violation properties of magnetic-dipolar interactions can\nbe used in other magnetic structures, different from the\nferromagnetic-resonance system with reduced dimensionality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Sep 2009 08:32:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}

A motivation is the bypass of\nany hypothetical earth-bound medium as an explanation for the earlier null\nfindings.

The characteristic equation, the solution of which\nyields the effective wave numbers of coherent elastic waves, is obtained in an\nexplicit form without the use of any renormalisation methods. Two\napproximations are considered. First, formulae are derived for the effective\nwave numbers in a dilute random distribution of identical scatterers.

Second, the high frequency approximation is compared with the\nWaterman and Truell approach derived here for elastic waves.
