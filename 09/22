We combine\nthe very deep optical to near-Infrared photometry from the HST ACS and NICMOS\ncameras with mid-Infrared Spitzer IRAC imaging available through the GOODS\nprogram. After carefully removing the flux from contaminating foreground\nsources we have obtained reliable photometry in the 3.6 and 4.5 micron IRAC\nchannels. The spectral shapes of these sources, including their rest frame\noptical colors, strongly support their being at z~7 with a mean photometric\nredshift of <z>=7.2+/-0.5. We use Bruzual & Charlot (2003) synthetic stellar\npopulation models to constrain their stellar masses and star formation\nhistories. We find stellar masses that range over 0.1 -12x10^9 M_sol and\naverage ages from 20 Myr to up to 425 Myr with a mean of ~300 Myr, suggesting\nthat in some of these galaxies most of the stars were formed at z>8 (and\nprobably at z>~10). The best fits to the observed SEDs are consistent with\nlittle or no dust extinction, in agreement with recent results at z~4-8. The\nstar formation rates (SFR) are in the range from 5-20 M_sol/yr. From this\nsample we measure a stellar mass density of 6.6_{-3.3}^{+5.4}x10^5 M_sol/Mpc^3\nto a limit of M_{UV,AB}<-20 (or 0.4 L*(z=3)). Combined with a fiducial lower\nlimit for their ages (80 Myr) this implies a maximum SFR density of 0.008\nM_sol/yr/Mpc^3. This is well below the critical level needed to reionize the\nuniverse at z~8 using standard assumptions. However, this result is based on\nluminous sources (>L*) and does not include the dominant contribution of the\nfainter galaxies. Strikingly, we find that the specific SFR is constant from\nz~7 to z~2 but drops substantially at more recent times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2009 18:32:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2010 21:53:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

We provide the parameterization of these power spectra in terms of\nseparate instrument noise, shot noise, and power law components. Our\nmeasurements of spatial fluctuations of the CIB intensity indicate the mean\nemission from the objects producing the fluctuations is quite low (>~1 nW m-2\nsr-1 at 3-5 micron), and thus consistent with current gamma-ray absorption\nconstraints. The source of the fluctuations may be high-z Population III\nobjects, or a more local component of very low luminosity objects with\nclustering properties that differ from the resolved galaxies.

An analysis of the\nnear-IR spectrum with a non-LTE model atmosphere code demonstrated that it was\nan highly luminous WN9h star, for which comparison to evolutionary tracks\nsuggests an age of 2-2.5Myr and an initial mass of ~110Msun.

Replacing charge with the \"spin\" of an electron to encode\ninformation may eliminate much of this dissipation and lead to more\nenergy-efficient \"green electronics\".

We touch on several\nprocesses, but concentrate on low and high flow rate extremes, perhaps the most\nlikely. We model explosive outgassing for the smallest gas overpressure at the\nregolith base that releases the regolith plug above it. This disturbance's\ntimescale and affected area are consistent with observed TLPs; we also discuss\nother effects. For slow flow, escape through the regolith is prolonged by low\ndiffusivity. Water, found recently in deep magma samples, is unique among\ncandidate volatiles, capable of freezing between the regolith base and surface,\nespecially near the lunar poles. For major outgassing sites, we consider the\npossible accumulation of water ice. Over geological time ice accumulation can\nevolve downward through the regolith. Depending on gases additional to water,\nregolith diffusivity might be suppressed chemically, blocking seepage and\nforcing the ice zone to expand to larger areas, up to square km scales, again,\nparticularly at high latitudes. We propose an empirical path forward, wherein\ncurrent and forthcoming technologies provide controlled, sensitive probes of\noutgassing. The optical transient/outgassing connection, addressed via\nEarth-based remote sensing, suggests imaging and/or spectroscopy, but aspects\nof lunar outgassing might be more covert, as indicated above. TLPs betray some\noutgassing, but does outgassing necessarily produces TLPs? We also suggest more\nintrusive techniques from radar to in-situ probes.

The HI distribution and kinematics of the disc are\nanalyzed and basic dynamical properties are given. The rotation curve is\nmeasured out to 38 kpc, showing a nuclear peak, a dip around 4 kpc, two\ndistinct flat parts and an increase in the outermost regions. Except for the\ninnermost regions, the axisymmetry of the gas rotation is very good. A very\nstrong warp of the HI disc is evidenced. The central regions appear less\ninclined than the average disc inclination, while the outer regions appear more\ninclined. Mass distribution models by LCDM NFW, Einasto or pseudo-isothermal\ndark matter halos with baryonic components are presented. They fail to\nreproduce the exact shape of the rotation curve. No significant differences are\nmeasured between the various shapes of halo. The dynamical mass of M31 enclosed\nwithin a radius of 38 kpc is (4.7 +/- 0.5) x 10^11 Msol. The dark matter\ncomponent is almost 4 times more massive than the baryonic mass inside this\nradius. A total mass of 1.0 x 10^12 Msol is derived inside the virial radius.\nNew HI structures are discovered in the datacube, like the detection of up to\nfive HI components per spectrum, which is very rarely seen in other galaxies.\nThe most remarkable new HI structures are thin HI spurs and an external arm in\nthe disc outskirts. A relationship between these spurs and outer stellar clumps\nis evidenced. The external arm is 32 kpc long, lies on the far side of the\ngalaxy and has no obvious counterpart on the other side of the galaxy. Its\nkinematics clearly differs from the outer adjacent disc. Both these HI\nperturbations could result from tidal interactions with galaxy companions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2009 20:00:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

As the\neffective Yang-Mills Lagrangian is completely determined by the quantum field\ntheory, there is no adjustable parameter in the model except the energy scale.\nIn this model, the equation-of-state (EOS) of the YMC dark energy, $w_y > -1$\nand $w_y < -1$, can both be naturally realized. By studying the evolution of\nvarious components in the model, we find that, in the early stage of the\nuniverse, dark energy tracked the evolution of the radiation, i.e. $w_y \\to\n1/3$. However, in the late stage, $w_y$ naturally runs to the critical state\nwith $w_y = -1$, and the universe transits from matter-dominated into dark\nenergy dominated stage only at recently $z \\sim 0.3$. These characters are\nindependent of the choice of the initial condition, and the cosmic coincidence\nproblem is avoided in the models. We also find that, if the possible\ninteraction between YMC and dust matter is considered, the late time attractor\nsolution may exist. In this case, the EOS of YMC must evolve from $w_y>0$ into\n$w_y < -1$, which is slightly suggested by the observations. At the same time,\nthe total EOS in the attractor solution is $w_{tot} = -1$, the universe being\nthe de Sitter expansion in the late stage, and the cosmic big rip is naturally\navoided.

So, it is possible to use this result as a test for a LIV and\nexplore the possibility that the boson that started the baryogenesis explains,\nin part, the dark matter. We will obtain estimates about the beginning time of\nthe baryogenesis and the boson mass too, that come directly from the LIV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2009 00:56:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-23"}

Light-front\nholography allows hadronic amplitudes in the AdS fifth dimension to be mapped\nto frame-independent light-front wavefunctions of hadrons in physical\nspace-time, thus providing a relativistic description of hadrons at the\namplitude level. We identify the AdS coordinate $z$ with an invariant\nlight-front coordinate $\\zeta$ which separates the dynamics of quark and gluon\nbinding from the kinematics of constituent spin and internal orbital angular\nmomentum. The result is a single-variable light-front Schr\\\"odinger equation\nwith a confining potential which determines the eigenspectrum and the\nlight-front wavefunctions of hadrons for general spin and orbital angular\nmomentum. The mapping of electromagnetic and gravitational form factors in AdS\nspace to their corresponding expressions in light-front theory confirms this\ncorrespondence. Some novel features of QCD are discussed, including the\nconsequences of confinement for quark and gluon condensates. The distinction\nbetween static structure functions, such as the probability distributions\ncomputed from the square of the light-front wavefunctions, versus dynamical\nstructure functions which include the effects of rescattering, is emphasized.

The approach is\nto apply a combination of replica methods and field theoretic techniques\ndeveloped for superfluid Bose systems. This leads to an equation for the\nlow-temperature Bose-Einstein condensate which is derived in the Hartree-Fock\napproximation. The equation is similar to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, but\nthe hard-core coupling constant is renormalised by the presence of the random\ninteractions in a position dependent way. The amorphous contribution contains\nthe replica diagonal and off-diagonal Green's functions, for which the Dyson\nequations are formulated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2009 06:53:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-23"}

Our forcing is tidal like, but its main property is\nthat it is on the large scales. Our solutions first confirm some analytical\nresults obtained on a two-dimensional model by Ogilvie (2005). We also note\nthat as the frequency of the forcing varies, the dissipation varies drastically\nif the Ekman number E is low (as is usually the case). We then investigate the\nthree-dimensional case and compare the results to the foregoing model. These\nsolutions show, like their 2D counterpart, a spiky dissipation curve when the\nfrequency of the forcing is varied; they also display small frequency intervals\nwhere the viscous dissipation is independent of viscosity. However, we show\nthat the response of the fluid in these frequency intervals is crucially\ndominated by the shear layer that is emitted at the critical latitude on the\ninner sphere. The asymptotic regime is reached when an attractor has been\nexcited by this shear layer. This property is not shared by the two-dimensional\nmodel. Finally, resonances of the three-dimensional model correspond to some\nselected least-damped eigenmodes. Unlike their two-dimensional counter parts\nthese modes are not associated with simple attractors; instead, they show up in\nfrequency intervals with a weakly contracting web of characteristics. Besides,\nwe show that the inner core is negligible when its relative radius is less than\nthe critical value 0.4E^{1/5}. For these spherical shells, the full sphere\nsolutions give a good approximation of the flows (abridged abstract).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2009 07:11:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

We model the Spectral Energy\nDistributions (SEDs) employing a revised version of the Bruzual and Charlot\nsynthesis population code that incorporates a new treatment of the TP--AGB\nphase (CB07). Our primary aim is to investigate the impact of the AGB phase in\nthe stellar masses of the LBGs, and compare our new results with previous\nstellar mass estimates. Based on the new CB07 code we find that the stellar\nmasses of LBGs are smaller on average by a factor of ~1.4 compared to previous\nestimates. LBGs with 8um and/or 24um detections show higher masses (M~10^11 Mo)\nthan LBGs faint in the IRAC bands (M~10^9 Mo). The ages of these massive LBGs\nare considerably higher than the rest of the population, indicating that they\nhave been star-forming for at least ~1 Gyr. We also show how the addition of\nthe IRAC bands, improves the accuracy of the estimated stellar masses and\nreduced the scatter on the derived M/L ratios. In particular, we present a\ntight correlation between the 8um IRAC band (rest-frame K for galaxies at z~3)\nand the stellar mass.

We investigate the nuclear region of the\nstarbust galaxy IC 694 (=Arp 299-A) at radio wavelengths, aimed at discovering\nrecently exploded CCSNe, as well as to determine their rate of explosion, which\ncarries crucial information on star formation rates, the initial mass function\nand starburst scenarios at work. Methods. We use the electronic European VLBI\nNetwork to image with milliarcsecond resolution the 5.0 GHz compact radio\nemission of the innermost nuclear region of IC 694. Results. Our observations\nreveal the presence of a rich cluster of 26 compact radio emitting sources in\nthe central 150 pc of the nuclear starburst in IC 694. The large brightness\ntemperatures observed for the compact sources indicate a non-thermal origin for\nthe observed radio emission, implying that most, if not all, of those sources\nare young radio supernovae (RSNe) and supernova remnants (SNRs). We find\nevidence for at least three relatively young, slowly-evolving, long-lasting\nRSNe (A0, A12, and A15) which appear to display unusual properties; suggesting\nthat the conditions in the local circumstellar medium (CSM) play a significant\nrole in determining the radio behaviour of expanding SNe.

The\nbase station (BS) is equipped with multiple transmit antennas, and each user\nterminal is equipped with one or more receive antennas. The BS employs\nTomlinson-Harashima precoding (THP) for inter-user interference\npre-cancellation at the transmitter. We consider robust transceiver designs\nthat jointly optimize the transmit THP filters and receive filter for two\nmodels of CSIT errors. The first model is a stochastic error (SE) model, where\nthe CSIT error is Gaussian-distributed. This model is applicable when the CSIT\nerror is dominated by channel estimation error. In this case, the proposed\nrobust transceiver design seeks to minimize a stochastic function of the sum\nmean square error (SMSE) under a constraint on the total BS transmit power. We\npropose an iterative algorithm to solve this problem. The other model we\nconsider is a norm-bounded error (NBE) model, where the CSIT error can be\nspecified by an uncertainty set. This model is applicable when the CSIT error\nis dominated by quantization errors. In this case, we consider a worst-case\ndesign. For this model, we consider robust i) minimum SMSE, ii)\nMSE-constrained, and iii) MSE-balancing transceiver designs. We propose\niterative algorithms to solve these problems, wherein each iteration involves a\npair of semi-definite programs (SDP). Further, we consider an extension of the\nproposed algorithm to the case with per-antenna power constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2009 11:24:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

Many previous\ntheoretical studies of flux emergence use a twisted cylindrical tube in the\nsolar interior as the initial condition. Important insights can be gained from\nthis model, however, it does have shortcomings. The axis of the tube never\nfully emerges as dense plasma becomes trapped in magnetic dips and restrains\nits ascent. Also, since the entire tube is buoyant, the main photospheric\nfootpoints (sunspots) continually drift apart. These problems make it difficult\nto produce a convincing sunspot pair. We aim to address these problems by\nconsidering a different initial condition, namely a toroidal flux tube. We\nperform numerical experiments and solve the 3D MHD equations. The dynamics are\ninvestigated through a range of initial field strengths and twists. The\nexperiments demonstrate that the emergence of toroidal flux tubes is highly\ndynamic and exhibits a rich variety of behaviour. In answer to the aims,\nhowever, if the initial field strength is strong enough, the axis of the tube\ncan fully emerge. Also, the sunspot pair does not continually drift apart.\nInstead, its maximum separation is the diameter of the original toroidal tube.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2009 13:27:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-23"}

The data provide the first opportunity to track the evolution of the\nprincipal spectral features. In the early stages of the outburst, the optically\nthick disc dominates the optical and the line components show clear orbital\nradial velocity excursions. In the course of several weeks, optically thin\nregions become more prominent as strong emission lines replace the broad disc\nabsorption.\n  Post-outburst spectroscopy covering the I-band illustrates the advantages of\nCaII relative to the commonly used Balmer lines when attempting to constrain\nbinary parameters. Due to the lower ionisation energy combined with smaller\nthermal and shear broadening of these lines, a sharp emission component is seen\nto be moving in between the accretion disc peaks in the CaII line. No such\ncomponent is visible in the Balmer lines. We interpret this as an emission\ncomponent originating on the hitherto unseen mass donor star.\n  While our conservative dynamical limits place a hard upper limit on the\nbinary mass ratio of q<0.23, we favour a significantly lower value near q~0.06.\nPulsation modeling suggests a WD mass ~1 M_sun.

A\npartial answer to this question is given in Feinberg's deficiency one\nalgorithm. This algorithm can decide about multistationarity by analyzing\nsystems of linear inequalities that are independent of parameter values.\nHowever, the deficiency one algorithm is limited to what its author calls\nregular deficiency one networks. Many realistic networks have a deficiency\nhigher than one, thus the algorithm cannot be applied directly. In a previous\npublication it was suggested to analyze certain well defined subnetworks that\nare guaranteed to be of deficiency one. Realistic reaction networks, however,\noften lead to subnetworks that are irregular, especially if metabolic networks\nare considered. Here the special structure of the subnetworks is used to derive\nconditions for multistationarity.
