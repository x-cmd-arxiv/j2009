These observations allow us\nto characterize the galactic and local environments of short GRBs as a powerful\nconstraint on the nature of their progenitors. Using the HST data for 10 short\nGRB hosts we determine the host morphological properties, measure precise\nphysical and host-normalized offsets relative to the galaxy centers, and study\nthe locations of short GRBs relative to their host light distributions. We find\nthat most short GRB hosts have exponential disk profiles, characteristic of\nlate-type galaxies, but with a median size that is twice as large as that of\nlong GRB hosts, commensurate with their higher luminosities. The observed\ndistribution of projected physical offsets, supplemented by ground-based\nmeasurements, has a median of ~5 kpc, about 5 times larger than for long GRBs,\nand in good agreement with predicted offset distributions for NS-NS binary\nmergers. For the short GRB population as a whole we find the following robust\nconstraints: (i) >25% have projected offsets of <10 kpc; and (ii) >5% have\nprojected offsets of >20 kpc. We find no clear systematic trends for the offset\ndistribution of short GRBs with and without extended soft emission. While the\nphysical offsets are larger than for long GRBs, the distribution of\nhost-normalized offsets is nearly identical due to the larger size of short GRB\nhosts. Finally, unlike long GRBs, which are concentrated in the brightest\nregions of their host galaxies, short GRBs appear to under-represent the light\ndistribution of their hosts; this is true even in comparison to core-collapse\nand Type Ia supernovae. Based on these results, we conclude that short GRBs are\nconsistent with a progenitor population of NS-NS binaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2009 19:32:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2009 19:05:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

A key stage in evolution, however, appears to be\nrepresented by post-starburst galaxies. To investigate their impact on galaxy\nevolution, we initiated a multiwavelength study of galaxies with k+a spectral\nfeatures in the COSMOS field. We examine a mass-selected sample of k+a galaxies\nat z=0.48-1.2 using the spectroscopic zCOSMOS sample. K+a galaxies occupy the\nbrightest tail of the luminosity distribution. They are as massive as quiescent\ngalaxies and populate the green valley in the colour versus luminosity (or\nstellar mass) distribution. A small percentage (<8%) of these galaxies have\nradio and/or X-ray counterparts (implying an upper limit to the SFR of\n~8Msun/yr). Over the entire redshift range explored, the class of k+a galaxies\nis morphologically a heterogeneous population with a similar incidence of\nbulge-dominated and disky galaxies. This distribution does not vary with the\nstrength of the Hdelta absorption line but instead with stellar mass in a way\nreminiscent of the well-known mass-morphology relation. Although k+a galaxies\nare also found in underdense regions, they appear to reside typically in a\nsimilarly rich environment as quiescent galaxies on a physical scale of\n~2-8Mpc, and in groups they show a morphological early-to-late type ratio\nsimilar to the quiescent galaxy class. With the current data set, we do not\nfind evidence of statistical significant evolution in either the number/mass\ndensity of k+a galaxies at intermediate redshift with respect to the local\nvalues, or the spectral properties.

Here we recast the associated boundary data as 3-dimensional\ntensor fields intrinsic to the boundary. This provides a geometric presentation\nof the boundary data analogous to the 3-dimensional presentation of Cauchy data\nin terms of 3-metric and extrinsic curvature. In particular, diffeomorphisms of\nthe boundary data lead to vacuum spacetimes with isometric geometries. The\nproof of well-posedness is valid for the harmonic formulation and its\ngeneralizations. The Sommerfeld conditions can be directly applied to existing\nharmonic codes which have been used in simulating binary black holes, thus\nensuring boundary stability of the underlying analytic system. The geometric\nform of the boundary conditions also allows them to be formally applied to any\nmetric formulation of Einstein's equations, although well-posedness of the\nboundary problem is no longer ensured.

As a consequence, the companion star\nwill face eta Carinae on the orbital plane at different latitudes for different\norbital phases and, since both the mass loss rate and the wind velocity are\nlatitude dependent, they would produce the observed asymmetries in the X-ray\nflux. We were able to reproduce the main features of the X-ray light curve\nassuming that the rotation axis of eta Carinae forms an angle of 29 degrees\nwith the axis of the binary orbit. We also explained the short quasi-periodic\noscillations by assuming nutation of the rotation axis, with amplitude of about\n5 degrees and period of about 22 days.

Here we investigate\nthe communication patterns in two social Internet communities in search of\nstatistical laws in human interaction activity. This research reveals that\nhuman communication networks dynamically follow scaling laws that may also\nexplain the observed trends in economic growth. Specifically, we identify a\ngeneralized version of Gibrat's law of social activity expressed as a scaling\nlaw between the fluctuations in the number of messages sent by members and\ntheir level of activity. Gibrat's law has been essential in understanding\neconomic growth patterns, yet without an underlying general principle for its\norigin.

The string is assumed to have distributed mass\nand elasticity that permits axial deformations. The rigid body is attached to\nthe string at an arbitrary point, and the resulting string pendulum system\nexhibits nontrivial coupling between the elastic wave propagation in the string\nand the rigid body dynamics. Variational methods are used to develop coupled\nordinary and partial differential equations of motion. Computational methods,\nreferred to as Lie group variational integrators, are then developed, based on\na finite element approximation and the use of variational methods in a\ndiscrete-time setting to obtain discrete-time equations of motion.

The spectral analysis of this\nproblem allows us to specify the best sampling strategy in electromagnetic\nfrequency and predicts a spatially anisotropic distribution of posterior\nerrors. The reconstruction method is illustrated for reference fields extracted\nfrom realistic magneto-hydrodynamical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2009 07:23:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2009 19:34:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The accretion of stars onto the central supermassive black hole at the\ncenter of the Milky Way is predicted to generate large fluxes of\nsubrelativistic ions in the Galactic center region. We analyze the intensity,\nshape and spatial distribution of de-excitation gamma-ray lines produced by\nnuclear interactions of these energetic particles with the ambient medium.\n  Methods. We first estimate the amount and mean kinetic energy of particles\nreleased from the central black hole during star disruption. We then calculate\nfrom a kinetic equation the energy and spatial distributions of these particles\nin the Galactic center region. These particle distributions are then used to\nderive the characteristics of the main nuclear interaction gamma-ray lines.\n  Results. Because the time period of star capture by the supermassive black\nhole is expected to be shorter than the lifetime of the ejected fast particles\nagainst Coulomb losses, the gamma-ray emission is predicted to be stationary.\nWe find that the nuclear de-excitation lines should be emitted from a region of\nmaximum 5$^\\circ$ angular radius.

A partial\nsolution to this problem was given by Carlos Beltran and Luis Miguel Pardo who\nexhibited a randomized algorithm doing so. In this paper we further extend this\nresult in several directions. Firstly, we exhibit a linear homotopy algorithm\nthat efficiently implements a non-constructive idea of Mike Shub. This\nalgorithm is then used in a randomized algorithm, call it LV, a la\nBeltran-Pardo. Secondly, we perform a smoothed analysis (in the sense of\nSpielman and Teng) of algorithm LV and prove that its smoothed complexity is\npolynomial in the input size and $\\sigma^{-1}$, where $\\sigma$ controls the\nsize of of the random perturbation of the input systems. Thirdly, we perform a\ncondition-based analysis of LV. That is, we give a bound, for each system $f$,\nof the expected running time of LV with input $f$. In addition to its\ndependence on $N$ this bound also depends on the condition of $f$. Fourthly,\nand to conclude, we return to Smale's 17th problem as originally formulated for\ndeterministic algorithms.

Since they have been\nimplicated in providing hot plasma to coronal loops, their formation, evolution\nand properties are important ingredients for a better understanding of the mass\nand energy balance of the low solar atmosphere. Here we report on the discovery\nof the disk counterparts of type II spicules using spectral imaging data in the\nCa II 854.2 nm and Halpha lines with the CRisp Imaging SpectroPolarimeter\n(CRISP) at the Swedish Solar Telescope (SST) in La Palma.

These blueward excursions seem to form a separate absorbing component\nwith Doppler shifts of order 20 and 50 km/s for the Ca II 854.2 nm and Halpha\nline respectively. We show that the appearance, lifetimes, longitudinal and\ntransverse velocities and occurrence rate of these rapid blue excursions on the\ndisk are very similar to those of the type II spicules at the limb. A detailed\nstudy of the spectral line profiles in these events suggests that plasma is\naccelerated along the jet, and plasma is being heated throughout the short\nlifetime of the event.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2009 09:04:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

As an example, I will focus in this review on two major\nrecent observational results on the cosmic evolution of supermassive black\nholes, focusing on the novel contribution given to the field by the COSMOS\nsurvey. First of all, I will discuss the evidence for the so-called\n\"downsizing\" in the AGN population as derived from large X-ray surveys. I will\nthen present new constraints on the evolution of the black hole-galaxy scaling\nrelation at 1<z<2 derived by exploiting the full multi-wavelength coverage of\nthe survey on a complete sample of ~90 type 1 AGN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2009 09:16:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

This paper contains a theory which utilizes the\nstability to estimate the distance between the true and approximate posterior\ndistributions, in the Hellinger metric, in terms of error estimates for\napproximation of the underlying forward problem. This is potentially useful as\nit allows for the transfer of estimates from the numerical analysis of forward\nproblems into estimates for the solution of the related inverse problem.

We present a new mechanism for\ngeneration of large-scale magnetic field, based on the power-counting\nrenormalizable theory of gravitation recently proposed by Horava. Contrary to\nthe usual case in general relativity, the U(1) gauge symmetry of a Maxwell\naction in this theory permits terms breaking conformal invariance in the\nultraviolet. Moreover, for high frequency modes, the anisotropic scaling\nintrinsic to the theory inevitably makes the sound horizon far outside the\nHubble horizon. Consequently, non-inflationary cosmic expansion in the early\nuniverse naturally generates super-horizon quantum fluctuations of the magnetic\nfield. Specializing our consideration to the case with the dynamical critical\nexponent $z=3$, we show an explicit set of parameters for which (i) the\namplitude of generated magnetic field is large enough as a seed for the dynamo\nmechanism; (ii) backreaction to the cosmic expansion is small enough; and (iii)\nthe high-energy dispersion relation is consistent with the most recent\nobservational limits from MAGIC and FERMI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2009 11:29:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2009 11:19:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-07"}

The differences in parameter correlations, and in the allowed\nregions in likelihood space, reveal the impact of the new physics on the basic\ningredients of the model, such as the star-formation laws, feedback recipes and\nthe black hole growth model. With satellite disruption in place, we get a model\nlikelihood four times higher than in the original model, indicating that the\nnew process seems to be favoured by observations. This is achieved mainly due\nto a reduction in black hole growth that produces a better agreement between\nthe properties of central black holes and host galaxies.

When the environment\nis homogeneous and the impurities are confined in a potential consisting of a\nset of double wells, the system can be described in terms of an effective\nspin-boson model, where the occupation of the left or right well of each site\nrepresents the two (pseudo)-spin states. The irreversible dynamics of such\nsystem is here studied exactly, i.e., not in terms of a Markovian master\nequation. The dynamics of one and two impurities is remarkably different in\nrespect of the standard decoherence of the spin - boson system.

Our analytical theory for the GNFW lenses with parametrized\ncusp slope (alpha) gives us a relation connecting the cusp slope of the lensing\nprofile to the observed magnification ratio of the produced images and location\nof the optical axis. The relation does not depend on cosmology, total lens\nmass, concentration or redshifts of the the lens and the lensed object. Simple\ngeometry of axially symmetric lensing and aforementioned relation enables us to\ndefine a threshold value alpha_CSL for the cusp slope, independent from\nlocation of the optical axis. The threshold cusp slope value alpha=alpha_CSL is\nthe shallowest slope for the inner part of the GNFW profile that can produce\nthe observed magnification ratio with any lensing configuration. We use\ndistribution of these threshold values in a statistical study of the double\nimage lenses in order to limit the possible cusp slope values, and identify\nwhether there exists a population of haloes with similar profiles. Our\ntheoretical fit indicates that within our sample of double image gravitational\nlenses, most of the haloes have cusp slope alpha=-1.95 +/- 0.02.

The NLTE abundance of Co in solar photosphere is\n4.95 +/- 0.04 dex, which is in agreement with that in C I meteorites within the\ncombined uncertainties. The spectral lines of Co I were calculated using the\nresults of recent measurements of hyperfine interaction constants by UV Fourier\ntransform spectrometry.

A differential\nabundance analysis of Co is carried out for 18 stars in the metallicity range\n-3.12 < [Fe/H] < 0. The abundances are derived by method of spectrum synthesis.\nAt low [Fe/H], NLTE abundance corrections for Co I lines are as large as +0.6\n>... +0.8 dex. Thus, LTE abundances of Co in metal-poor stars are severely\nunderestimated. The stellar NLTE abundances determined from the single UV line\nof Co II are lower by ~0.5-0.6 dex. The discrepancy might be attributed to\npossible blends that have not been accounted for in the solar Co II line and\nits erroneous oscillator strength. The increasing [Co/Fe] trend in metal-poor\nstars, as calculated from the Co I lines under NLTE, can be explained if Co is\noverproduced relative to Fe in massive stars.

We\nperform global self-consistent geodynamo simulations and calculate the\nevolution of a kinematically advanced tracer field. The self-consistent\nvelocity field enters the induction equation in each time step, but the tracer\nfield does not contribute to the Lorentz force. This experiment has been\nperformed by Cattaneo & Tobias (2009) and is closely related to the test field\nmethod by Schrinner et al. (2005, 2007). We find two dynamo regimes in which\nthe tracer field either grows exponentially or approaches a state aligned with\nthe actual self-consistent magnetic field after an initial transition period.\nBoth regimes can be distinguished by the Rossby number and coincide with the\ndipolar and multipolar dynamo regimes identified by Christensen & Aubert\n(2006). Dipolar dynamos with low Rossby number are kinematically stable whereas\nthe tracer field grows exponentially in the multipolar dynamo regime. This\ndifference in the saturation process for dynamos in both regimes comes along\nwith differences in their time variability. Within our sample of 20 models,\nsolely kinematically unstable dynamos show dipole reversals and large\nexcursions. The complicated time behaviour of these dynamos presumably relates\nto the alternating growth of several competing dynamo modes. On the other hand,\ndynamos in the low Rossby number regime exhibit a rather simple time dependence\nand their saturation merely results in a fluctuation of the fundamental dynamo\nmode about its critical state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2009 14:40:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

We investigate the long-term evolution of the large-scale photospheric\nmagnetic field geometry of the solar-type star HD 190771. With fundamental\nparameters very close to those of the Sun except for a shorter rotation period\nof 8.8 d, HD 190771 provides us with a first insight into the specific impact\nof the rotation rate in the dynamo generation of magnetic fields in 1 $M_\\odot$\nstars.\n  Methods. We use circularly polarized, high-resolution spectra obtained with\nthe NARVAL spectropolarimeter (Observatoire du Pic du Midi, France) and compute\ncross-correlation line profiles with high signal-to-noise ratio to detect\npolarized Zeeman signatures. From three phase-resolved data sets collected\nduring the summers of 2007, 2008, and 2009, we model the large-scale\nphotospheric magnetic field of the star by means of Zeeman-Doppler imaging and\nfollow its temporal evolution.\n  Results. The comparison of the magnetic maps shows that a polarity reversal\nof the axisymmetric component of the large-scale magnetic field occurred\nbetween 2007 and 2008, this evolution being observed in both the poloidal and\ntoroidal magnetic components. Between 2008 and 2009, another type of global\nevolution occured, characterized by a sharp decrease of the fraction of\nmagnetic energy stored in the toroidal component. These changes were not\naccompanied by significant evolution in the total photospheric magnetic energy.\nUsing our spectra to perform radial velocity measurements, we also detect a\nvery low-mass stellar companion to HD 190771.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2009 15:45:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 2009 14:38:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}
