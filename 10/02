We determine the\nUV-continuum slope beta in these galaxies, and compare the slopes with galaxies\nat later times to measure the evolution in beta. For luminous L*(z=3) galaxies,\nwe measure a mean UV-continuum slope beta of -2.0+/-0.2, which is comparable to\nthe beta~-2 derived at similar luminosities at z~5-6. However, for the lower\nluminosity 0.1L*(z=3) galaxies, we measure a mean beta of -3.0+/-0.2. This is\nsubstantially bluer than is found for similar luminosity galaxies at z~4, just\n800 Myr later, and even at z~5-6. In principle, the observed beta of -3.0 can\nbe matched by a very young, dust-free stellar population, but when nebular\nemission is included the expected beta becomes >~-2.7. To produce these very\nblue beta's (i.e., beta~-3), extremely low metallicities and mechanisms to\nreduce the red nebular emission are likely required. For example, a large\nescape fraction (i.e., f_{esc}>~0.3) could minimize the contribution from this\nred nebular emission. If this is correct and the escape fraction in faint z~7\ngalaxies is >~0.3, it may help to explain how galaxies reionize the universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2009 19:42:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2009 17:23:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 20 Dec 2009 03:13:03 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 9 Jan 2010 04:06:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

In response, we have developed an economical\napproach to identifying SNe Ia and their redshifts using an uncommon type of\noptical filter which has multiple, discontinuous passbands on a single\nsubstrate. Observation of a supernova through a specially designed pair of\nthese `cross-correlation filters' measures the approximate amplitude and phase\nof the cross-correlation between the spectrum and a SN Ia template, a quantity\ntypically used to determine the redshift and type of a high-redshift SN Ia.\nSimulating the use of these filters, we obtain a sample of SNe Ia which is ~98%\npure with individual redshifts measured to 0.01 precision. The advantages of\nthis approach over standard broadband photometric methods are that it is\ninsensitive to reddening, independent of the color data used for subsequent\ndistance determinations which reduces selection or interpretation bias, and\nbecause it makes use of the spectral features its reliability is greater. A\ngreat advantage over long-slit spectroscopy comes from increased throughput,\nenhanced multiplexing and reduced set-up time resulting in a net gain in speed\nof up to ~30 times. This approach is also insensitive to host galaxy\ncontamination. Prototype filters were built and successfully used on Magellan\nwith LDSS-3 to characterize three SNLS candidates.

The surface densities of the\nz-dropouts are close to what predicted by earlier studies, however, those of\nthe Y- and J-dropouts are quite unexpected. While no Y- or J-dropouts have been\nfound at AB < 28.0 mag, their surface densities seem to increase sharply at\nfainter levels.

Analysis of\nthe HXR time profiles in different energy channels made with the Lomb\nperiodogram indicates two statistically significant time periods of about 16\nand 36 seconds. The 36-second QPP were observed only in the nonthermal HXR\nemission in the impulsive phase of the flare.

The electric force is relatively weaker but not negligible in the\n2D simulation, where the electron temperature is set higher to reduce the\ncomputational cost. The magnetic pressure gradient is the principal source of\nthe electrostatic field, when and after the instability saturates in the 1D\nsimulation and in the 2D simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2009 18:57:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

We find that the break from the\nsteep large object power-law causes a divot, or depletion of objects at r\n~10-20 km, which in-turn greatly reduces the disruption rate of objects with r>\n25-50 km, preserving the steep power-law behavior for objects at this size. Our\ncalculations demonstrate that the roll-over observed in the Kuiper belt size\ndistribution is naturally explained as an edge of a divot in the size\ndistribution; the radius at which the size distribution transitions away from\nthe power-law, and the shape of the divot from our simulations are consistent\nwith the size of the observed roll-over, and size distribution for smaller\nbodies.

The best way to test\nthis hypothesis is to measure the disk surface mass density directly via the\nkinematics of old disk stars. To this end, we have used planetary nebulae (PNe)\nas test particles and have measured the vertical velocity dispersion (sigma_z)\nthroughout the disks of five nearby, low-inclination spiral galaxies: IC 342,\nM74 (NGC 628), M83 (NGC 5236), M94 (NGC 4736), and M101 (NGC 5457). By using HI\nto map galactic rotation and the epicyclic approximation to extract sigma_z\nfrom the line-of-sight dispersion, we find that, with the lone exception of\nM101, our disks do have a constant M/L out to ~3 optical scale lengths.\nHowever, once outside this radius, sigma_z stops declining and becomes flat\nwith radius. Possible explanations for this behavior include an increase in the\ndisk mass-to-light ratio, an increase in the importance of the thick disk, and\nheating of the thin disk by halo substructure. We also find that the disks of\nearly type spirals have higher values of M/L and are closer to maximal than the\ndisks of later-type spirals, and that the unseen inner halos of these systems\nare better fit by pseudo-isothermal laws than by NFW models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2009 21:12:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

This\nhas predictive value because, while the transport coefficients of dense fluids\nare difficult to estimate from first principles, excess entropy can often be\naccurately predicted from liquid-state theory. Here, we use molecular\nsimulations to investigate whether Rosenfeld's observation is a special case of\na more general scaling law relating mobility of particles in mixtures to excess\nentropy. Specifically, we study tracer diffusivities, static structure, and\nthermodynamic properties of a variety of one- and two-component model fluid\nsystems with either additive or non-additive interactions of the hard-sphere or\nGaussian-core form. The results of the simulations demonstrate that the effects\nof mixture concentration and composition, particle-size asymmetry and\nadditivity, and strength of the interparticle interactions in these fluids are\nconsistent with an empirical scaling law relating the excess entropy to a new\ndimensionless (generalized Rosenfeld) form of tracer diffusivity, which we\nintroduce here. The dimensionless form of the tracer diffusivity follows from\nknowledge of the intermolecular potential and the transport / thermodynamic\nbehavior of fluids in the dilute limit. The generalized Rosenfeld scaling\nrequires less information, and provides more accurate predictions, than either\nEnskog theory or scalings based on the pair-correlation contribution to the\nexcess entropy.

Our results are the following. Structural results: We extend the\ntechnique of uncrossing, usually applied to families of sets, to families of\npartitions. As a consequence we show that any basic feasible solution to the\npartition LP formulation has sparse support. Although the number of variables\ncould be exponential, the number of positive variables is at most the number of\nterminals. Relations with other relaxations: We show the equivalence of the\npartition LP relaxation with other known hypergraphic relaxations. We also show\nthat these hypergraphic relaxations are equivalent to the well studied\nbidirected cut relaxation, if the instance is quasibipartite. Integrality gap\nupper bounds: We show an upper bound of sqrt(3) ~ 1.729 on the integrality gap\nof these hypergraph relaxations in general graphs. In the special case of\nuniformly quasibipartite instances, we show an improved upper bound of 73/60 ~\n1.216. By our equivalence theorem, the latter result implies an improved upper\nbound for the bidirected cut relaxation as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2009 21:57:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Mar 2010 01:21:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

This\nfollows that the information rate of the communication system is alternatively\ngiven by the decay rate of the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) of the estimation system\nand by the Bode integral (BI) of the control system. Furthermore, the optimal\ntradeoff between the channel input power and information rate in feedback\ncommunication is alternatively characterized by the optimal tradeoff between\nthe (causal) one-step prediction mean-square error (MSE) and (anti-causal)\nsmoothing MSE (of an appropriate form) in estimation, and by the optimal\ntradeoff between the regulated output variance with causal feedback and the\ndisturbance rejection measure (BI or degree of anti-causality) in feedback\ncontrol.

There is growing evidence that jets in radio galaxies consist of a fast\nlow density outflow at the jet axis, surrounded by a slower, denser, extended\njet. The inner and outer jet components then have a different origin and\nlaunching mechanism, making their effective inertia, magnetization, associated\nenergy flux and angular momentum content different as well. Their interface\nwill develop differential rotation, where disruptions may occur. We here\ninvestigate the stability of rotating, two-component relativistic outflows\ntypical for jets in radio galaxies. For this purpose, we parametrically explore\nthe long term evolution of a transverse cross-section of radially stratified\njets numerically With grid-adaptive relativistic MHD simulations, augmented\nwith approximate linear stability analysis. We study the influence of\ndynamically important poloidal magnetic fields, with varying contributions of\nthe inner component jet to the total kinetic energy flux of the jet, on their\nnon-linear azimuthal stability. We demonstrate that two-component jets with\nhigh kinetic energy flux, and an inner jet effective inertia which is higher\nthan the outer jet effective inertia are subject to the development of a\nrelativistically enhanced, rotation-induced Rayleigh-Taylor type instability.\nThis instability plays a major role in decelerating the inner jet and the\noverall jet decollimation. This novel deceleration scenario can partly explain\nthe radio source dichotomy, relating it directly to the efficiency of the\ncentral engine in launching the inner jet component. The FRII/FRI transition\ncould then occur when the relative kinetic energy flux of the inner to the\nouter jet grows beyond a certain treshold.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 2009 06:49:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

In the present paper it is argued that the mentioned\nwidespread expectation need not be seen as being betrayed by what actually\nhappens.

Applications\nwhich illustrate these new methods focus on single and double qubits (quantum\ngates) whereby the environment is modeled either within the Lindblad equation\nor a bath of bosons (spin-boson model).

In\nthe first case the geometry is completely smooth and the spectrum of metric\nfluctuations shows a single massless bound state, corresponding to the 4D\ngraviton, and a tower of massive states described by a continuous spectrum of\nKaluza-Klein excitations starting from zero mass, indicating the lack of a mass\ngap. In the second case, there are two bound states, a massless 4D graviton and\na massive excitation, separated by a mass gap from a continuous spectrum of\nmassive modes; nevertheless, the presence of a mass gap in the graviton\nspectrum of the theory is responsible for a naked singularity at the boundaries\n(or spatial infinity) of the Riemannian manifold.

Null\npoints appear as the reconnection begins and persist throughout the rest of the\nemergence, where they can be found mostly in the model photosphere and\ntransition region, forming two loose clusters on either side of the emerging\nflux tube.

At thermal equilibrium\nsuperdiffusive behavior can emerge if the total integral of the memory kernel\nvanishes. Such a situation of vanishing static friction is caused by a\nsuper-Ohmic thermal bath. One of the simplest models of ballistic\nsuperdiffusion is determined by a bi-exponential memory kernel that was\nproposed by Bao [J.-D. Bao, J. Stat. Phys. 114, 503 (2004)]. We show that this\nnon-Markovian model has infinitely many different 4-dimensional Markovian\nembeddings. Implementing numerically the simplest one, we demonstrate that (i)\nthe presence of a periodic potential with arbitrarily low barriers changes the\nasymptotic large time behavior from free ballistic superdiffusion into normal\ndiffusion; (ii) an additional biasing force renders the asymptotic dynamics\nsuperdiffusive again. The development of transients that display a\nqualitatively different behavior compared to the true large-time asymptotics\npresents a general feature of this non-Markovian dynamics. These transients\nthough may be extremely long. As a consequence, they can be even mistaken as\nthe true asymptotics. We find that such intermediate asymptotics exhibit a\ngiant enhancement of superdiffusion in tilted washboard potentials and it is\naccompanied by a giant transient superballistic current growing proportional to\n$t^{\\alpha_{{\\rm eff}}}$ with an exponent $\\alpha_{\\rm eff}$ that can exceed\nthe ballistic value of two.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 2009 14:20:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2010 08:39:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-08"}

Fe occupies a distinct\nposition at the border between regimes (ii) and (iii) and shows a more complex\nbehavior: while is non-magnetic at the level of GGA calculations, its spin\nmoment can be switched on using GGA+U calculations with moderate values of the\nU parameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 2009 14:38:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The\nproblem with the latter is that they require gas temperatures (above $10^5$ K)\nmuch higher than the temperatures of the cold and warm components of the\nextra-planar gas layer. In this paper, we attempt to overcome this problem by\ndescribing the extra-planar gas as a system of gas clouds obeying the Jeans\nequations.

The exponent $\\gamma$, characterizing\nthe number of polymer configurations, crosses over from a value of $\\gamma_1$ -\ncharacteristic of a planar boundary - at small $s$ to one reflecting the\noverall shape of the probe at large $s$. For a spherical probe the crossover is\nto an unencumbered polymer, while for a parabolic probe we cannot rule out a\nnew exponent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 2009 15:16:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}
