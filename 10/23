These techniques have two main applications: simulating sparse\nHamiltonians and implementing black-box unitary operations. In particular, we\ngive the best known simulation of sparse Hamiltonians with constant precision.\nOur method has complexity linear in both the sparseness D (the maximum number\nof nonzero elements in a column) and the evolution time t, whereas previous\nmethods had complexity scaling as D^4 and were superlinear in t. We also\nconsider the task of implementing an arbitrary unitary operation given a\nblack-box description of its matrix elements. Whereas standard methods for\nperforming an explicitly specified N x N unitary operation use O(N^2)\nelementary gates, we show that a black-box unitary can be performed with\nbounded error using O(N^{2/3} (log log N)^{4/3}) queries to its matrix\nelements. In fact, except for pathological cases, it appears that most\nunitaries can be performed with only O(sqrt{N}) queries, which is optimal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2009 19:55:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Aug 2010 21:45:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2011 15:09:13 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2011 04:53:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-02"}

An exchange\nprotocol is fair if it ensures that delivery of new values is balanced: If one\nparticipant obtains a new possession via the protocol, then all other\nparticipants will, too. Fair exchange requires progress assumptions, unlike\nsome other protocol properties. The strand space model is a framework for\ndesign and verification of cryptographic protocols. A strand is a local\nbehavior of a single principal in a single session of a protocol. A bundle is a\npartially ordered global execution built from protocol strands and adversary\nactivities. The strand space model needs two additions for fair exchange\nprotocols. First, we regard the state as a multiset of facts, and we allow\nstrands to cause changes in this state via multiset rewriting. Second, progress\nassumptions stipulate that some channels are resilient-and guaranteed to\ndeliver messages-and some principals are assumed not to stop at certain\ncritical steps. This method leads to proofs of correctness that cleanly\nseparate protocol properties, such as authentication and confidentiality, from\ninvariants governing state evolution. G.

At strong\ncoupling, an ultrarelativistic character of electron dynamics reveals and the\nbands which are remote from Fermi surfaces (valence band of electron-doped\nlayer and conduction band of hole-doped layer) are also affected by the\npairing.

The\npresence of baryons produces the concentration of the DM halo with respect to\nits corresponding dissipationless run, but we found that this response does not\nonly depend on the amount of baryons gathered in the central region but also on\nthe way they have been assembled. DM and baryons affect each other in a complex\nway so the formation history of a galaxy plays an important role on its final\ntotal mass distribution. Supernova (SN) feedback regulates the star formation\nand triggers galactic outflows not only in the central galaxy but also in its\nsatellites. Our results suggest that, as the effects of SN feedback get\nstronger, satellites get less massive and can even be more easily disrupted by\ndynamical friction, transferring less angular momentum. We found indications\nthat this angular momentum could be acquired not only by the outer part of the\nDM halo but also by the inner ones and by the stellar component in the central\ngalaxy.

Despite this, the nature of some of\nthese systems, and of the accelerated particles producing the VHE emission, is\nunclear. To answer some of these open questions, we conducted a multiwavelength\ncampaign of the VHE gamma-ray emitting X-ray binary LS I +61 303 including the\nMAGIC telescope, XMM-Newton, and Swift during 60% of an orbit in 2007\nSeptember. We detect a simultaneous outburst at X-ray and VHE bands, with the\npeak at phase 0.62 and a similar shape at both wavelengths. A linear fit to the\nsimultaneous X-ray/VHE pairs obtained during the outburst yields a correlation\ncoefficient of r=0.97, while a linear fit to all simultaneous pairs provides\nr=0.81. Since a variable absorption of the VHE emission towards the observer is\nnot expected for the data reported here, the correlation found indicates a\nsimultaneity in the emission processes. Assuming that they are dominated by a\nsingle particle population, either hadronic or leptonic, the X-ray/VHE flux\nratio favors leptonic models. This fact, together with the detected photon\nindices, suggests that in LS I +61 303 the X-rays are the result of synchrotron\nradiation of the same electrons that produce VHE emission as a result of\ninverse Compton scattering of stellar photons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2009 19:10:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-04"}

We also show, that the cosmology dependence of the\ncorrections to the recombination history modeled with RICO has a negligible\nimpact on the posterior distributions obtained for the case of the Planck\nsatellite.

We calculate the amount of extra heating in the envelope that is\nthen required to fit the radius of each planet, and we explore how this\nadditional power depends on the planetary atmospheric opacity and on the mass\nof a heavy-element central core. There is a degeneracy between the core mass\n$M_{\\rm core}$ and the heating $\\dot{E}_{\\rm heating}$. Therefore, in the case\nof tidal heating, there is for each planet a range of the couple $\\{M_{\\rm\ncore},e^2/Q'_p\\}$ that can lead to the same radius, where $Q'_p$ is the tidal\ndissipation factor and $e$ is the eccentricity. With this in mind, we also\ninvestigate the case of the non-inflated planet HAT-P-12b, which can admit\nsolutions combining a heavy-element core and tidal heating.

Here we\nrevisit the structure and evolution of rotationally-stabilized supermassive\nstars, taking into account their continuous accumulation of mass and their\nthermal relaxation. We show that the outer layers of supermassive stars are not\nthermally relaxed during much of the star's main sequence lifetime.

Beryllium abundances in stars with lithium abundance\ndeterminations can offer valuable complementary information on the nature of\nthese mechanisms. Our aim is to derive beryllium abundances along the whole\nevolutionary sequence of an open cluster, IC 4651. These Be abundances are used\ntogether with previously determined Li abundances, in the same sample stars, to\ninvestigate the mixing mechanisms in a range of stellar masses and evolutionary\nstages. New beryllium abundances are determined from high-resolution, high\nsignal-to-noise UVES spectra using spectrum synthesis and model atmospheres.\nThe careful synthetic modelling of the Be lines region is used to calculate\nreliable abundances in rapidly rotating stars. The observed behavior of Be and\nLi is compared to theoretical predictions from stellar models including\nrotation-induced mixing, internal gravity waves, atomic diffusion, and\nthermohaline mixing. Beryllium is detected in all the main sequence and\nturn-off sample stars, both slow- and fast-rotating stars, including the Li-dip\nstars, but was not detected in the red giants. Confirming previous results, we\nfind that the Li dip is also a Be dip, although the depletion of Be is more\nmodest than that of Li in the corresponding effective temperature range. For\npost-main-sequence stars, the Be dilution starts earlier within the Hertzsprung\ngap than expected from classical predictions as does the Li dilution. A clear\ndispersion in the Be abundances is also observed.

At different scales\nalong the outflows, i.e. $\\sim 10-10^{10} R_{\\rm Sch}$ from the black hole, the\nlocal conditions can lead to the generation of non-thermal populations of\nparticles via, e.g., magnetic reconnection, magneto-centrifugal mechanisms,\ndiffusive processes, or the so-called converter mechanism. These non-thermal\npopulations of particles, interacting with dense matter, magnetic, and\nradiation fields, could yield radio-to-gamma-ray emission via synchrotron\nprocess, inverse Compton scattering, relativistic Bremsstrahlung, proton-proton\nand photo-hadron colissions, and even heavy nuclei photo-disintegration. Other\nprocesses, like pair creation or the development of electromagnetic cascades,\ncould be also relevant in black-hole jets and their surroundings. Black holes\nof different masses, accretion rates and environments show different\nphenomenologies, as can be observed in AGNs, GRBs or microquasars. Nonetheless,\nthese sources basically share the same fundamental physics: accretion,\nblack-hole rotation, plus an environment, but they are individualized due to\ntheir own specific conditions. In this paper, we qualitatively review the main\ncharacteristics of the non-thermal emission produced in jets from black holes,\ngiving also a brief overview on the physical properties of black hole/jet\nsystems. We comment as well on some important differences and similarities\nbetween classes of sources, and on the prospects for the study of the\nnon-thermal emission from astrophysical sources powered by black holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2009 23:07:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-26"}

The cylinder\ntopology allows for non-contractible loops with fugacity alpha that wind around\nthe cylinder or for an arbitrary number ell of defects that propagate along the\nfull length of the cylinder. Using an enlarged periodic Temperley-Lieb algebra,\nwe set up commuting transfer matrices acting on states whose links are\nconsidered distinct with respect to connectivity around the front or back of\nthe cylinder.

Our basic objects are Delone multisets\nand tilings, which are self-replicating under a primitive substitution system\nof affine mappings with a common expansive map $Q$.

Experiments have shown that by\nadding holes the insulating phase breaks into antiferromagnetic (AFM) regions,\nwhich are separated by hole rich clumps (stripes) with a rapid change of the\nphase of the background spins and orbitals. However, recent experiments in\noverdoped manganites of the La(1-x)Ca(x)MnO(3) (LCMO) family have shown that\ninstead of charge stripes, charge in these systems is organized in a uniform\ncharge density wave (CDW). Besides, recent theoretical works predicted that the\nground state is inhomogeneously modulated by orbital and charge solitons, i.e.\nnarrow regions carrying charge (+/-)e/2, where the orbital arrangement varies\nvery rapidly.

In\nthe last part we discuss some topics about spinors and pinors, with particular\nattention to non-orientable manifolds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Oct 2009 14:55:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2013 14:19:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-20"}

We have\nperformed an optical (Ic-band) and near-infrared (J and Ks-band) photometric\nsurvey of Praesepe with a spatial coverage of 3.1deg^2. With 5sigma detection\nlimits of Ic=23.4 and J=20.0, our survey is sensitive to objects with masses\nfrom about 0.6 to 0.05Msol. The mass function of Praesepe rises from 0.6Msol\ndown to 0.1Msol and then turns-over at ~0.1Msol. The rise observed is in\nagreement with the mass function derived by previous studies, including a\nsurvey based on proper motion and photometry. Comparing our mass function with\nthat for another open cluster with a similar age, the Hyades (age ~ 600Myr), we\nsee a significant difference. Possible reasons are that dynamical evaporation\nhas not influenced the Hyades and Praesepe in the same way, or that the\nclusters did not have the same initial mass function, or that dynamical\ninteractions have modified the evolution of one or both clusters. Although a\ndifference in the binary fractions of the clusters could cause the observed\n(i.e. system) mass functions to differ, measurements in the literature give no\nevidence for a significant difference in the binary fractions of the two\nclusters.

The source displayed activity at all the\nobserved wavelengths: a general decreasing trend from optical to gamma-ray\nfrequencies was followed by an increase of radio emission after less than two\nmonths from the peak of the gamma-ray emission. The largest flux change, about\na factor of about 4, occurred in the X-ray band. The smallest was at\nultraviolet and near-infrared frequencies, where the rate of the detected\nphotons dropped by a factor 1.6-1.9.
