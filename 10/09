In the present contribution a simple but effective\ntheoretical framework is introduced to clarify the connections between a purely\nmechanical description and the thermodynamic characterization of the\nequilibrium state of an isolated quantum system. A salient feature of our\napproach is the very transparent distinction between the statistical aspects\nand the dynamical aspects in the description of isolated quantum systems. Like\nin the classical statistical mechanics, the equilibrium distribution of any\nproperty is identified on the basis of the time evolution of the considered\nsystem. As a consequence equilibrium properties of quantum system appear to\ndepend on the details of the initial state due to the abundance of constants of\nthe motion in the Schr\\\"odinger dynamics. On the other hand the study of the\nprobability distributions of some functions, such as the entropy or the\nequilibrium state of a subsystem, in statistical ensembles of pure states\nreveals the crucial role of typicality as the bridge between macroscopic\nthermodynamics and microscopic quantum dynamics. We shall consider two\nparticular ensembles: the random pure state ensemble and the fixed expectation\nenergy ensemble. The relation between the introduced ensembles, the properties\nof a given isolated system, and the standard quantum statistical description\nare discussed throughout the presentation. Finally we point out the conditions\nwhich should be satisfied by an ensemble in order to get meaningful\nthermodynamical characterization of an isolated quantum system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2009 17:06:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Jul 2010 12:42:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-22"}

In order to analyze their\nconsistency with thermodynamics, these quantities of interest are evaluated in\nthe limit of large number of components of the isolated system. The main\nresults can be summarized as follows: typical values of the entropy and of the\nequilibrium reduced density matrix as functions of the internal energy in the\nfixed expectation energy ensemble do not satisfy the requirement of\nthermodynamics. On the contrary, the thermodynamical description is recovered\nfrom the random pure state ensemble (RPSE), provided that one considers systems\nlarge enough. The thermodynamic limit of the considered properties for the spin\nsystem reveals a number of important features. First canonical statistics (and\nthus, canonical typicality as long as the fluctuations around the average value\nare small) emerges without the need of assuming the microcanonical space for\nthe global pure state. Moreover, we rigorously prove (i) the equivalence of the\n\"global temperature,\" derived from the entropy equation of state, with the\n\"local temperature\" determining the canonical state of the subsystems; and (ii)\nthe equivalence between the RPSE typical entropy and the canonical entropy for\nthe overall system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2009 18:30:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Jul 2010 12:46:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-22"}

While the shape of the Fermi surface (FS) obtained with the\nlocal density approximation (LDA) can be reproduced by a two-orbital model, it\nhas been argued that the bands that cross the chemical potential result from\nthe strong hybridization of three of the Fe 3d orbitals. For this reason, a\nthree-orbital Hamiltonian obtained with the Slater-Koster formalism by\nconsidering the hybridization of the As p orbitals with the Fe d_xz,d_yz, and\nd_xy orbitals is discussed here. This model reproduces qualitatively the FS\nshape and orbital composition obtained by LDA calculations for undoped\npnictides when four electrons per Fe are considered. Within a mean-field\napproximation, its magnetic and orbital properties in the undoped case are\ndescribed.

The control of transcription is the\nmost dominant type of regulation mediated by a complex of molecules such as\ntranscription factors. In general, regulatory molecules are of two types:\nactivator and repressor. Activators promote the initiation of transcription\nwhereas repressors inhibit transcription. In many cases, they regulate the gene\ntranscription on binding the promoter mutually exclusively and the observed\ngene expression response is either graded or binary. In experiments, the gene\nexpression response is quantified by the amount of proteins produced on varying\nthe concentration of an external inducer molecules in the cell. In this paper,\nwe study a gene regulatory network where activators and repressors both bind\nthe same promoter mutually exclusively. The network is modeled by assuming that\nthe gene can be in three possible states: repressed, unregulated and active. An\nexact analytical expression for the steady-state probability distribution of\nprotein levels is then derived. The exact result helps to explain the\nexperimental observations that in the presence of activator molecules the\nresponse is graded at all inducer levels whereas in the presence of both\nactivator and repressor molecules, the response is graded at low and high\ninducer levels and binary at an intermediate inducer level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2009 19:39:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2010 06:54:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-04"}

However, most of such bursts will be\nwashed out in the underlying confusion noise produced by all the other\n'standard' SMBH binaries emitting in the same frequency window. A detailed data\nanalysis study would be required to assess resolvability of such sources.\nImplementing a basic resolvability criterion, we find that the chance of\ncatching a resolvable burst at a one nanosecond precision level is 2-50%,\ndepending on the adopted SMBH evolution model. On the other hand, the\nprobability of detecting bursts produced by massive binaries (masses $\\gtrsim\n10^7\\msun$) with {\\it LISA} is negligible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2009 20:19:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2009 21:02:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

We\nobtained a medium-resolution Keck/OSIRIS J-band spectrum and a low-resolution\nIRTF/SpeX 0.8-2.4 um spectrum of HD 114762B. HD 114762B exhibits spectral\nfeatures common to both late-type dwarfs and subdwarfs, and we assign it a\nspectral type of d/sdM9 +/- 1. We use a Monte Carlo technique to fit\nPHOENIX/GAIA synthetic spectra to the observations, accounting for the\ncoarsely-gridded nature of the models. Fits to the entire OSIRIS J-band and to\nthe metal-sensitive J-band atomic absorption features (Fe I, K I, and Al I\nlines) yield model parameters that are most consistent with the metallicity of\nthe primary star and the high surface gravity expected of old late-type\nobjects. The effective temperatures and radii inferred from the model\natmosphere fitting broadly agree with those predicted by the evolutionary\nmodels of Chabrier & Baraffe, and the model color-absolute magnitude relations\naccurately predict the metallicity of HD 114762B. We conclude that current\nlow-mass, mildly metal-poor atmospheric and evolutionary models are mutually\nconsistent for spectral fits to medium-resolution J-band spectra of HD 114762B,\nbut are inconsistent for fits to low-resolution near-infrared spectra of mild\nsubdwarfs. Finally, we develop a technique for estimating distances to\nultracool subdwarfs based on a single near-infrared spectrum. We show that this\n\"spectroscopic parallax\" method enables distance estimates accurate to < 10% of\nparallactic distances for ultracool subdwarfs near the hydrogen burning minimum\nmass.

Sixteen\npreviously unknown pulsars were discovered by searching for pulsed signals at\nthe positions of bright gamma-ray sources seen with the LAT, or at the\npositions of objects suspected to be neutron stars based on observations at\nother wavelengths. Pulsed gamma-ray emission was discovered from twenty-four\nknown pulsars by using ephemerides (timing solutions) derived from monitoring\nradio pulsars. Eight of these new gamma-ray pulsars are millisecond pulsars.\nThe pulsed energy spectra can be described by a power law with an exponential\ncutoff, with cutoff energies in the range 1 to 5 GeV. The rotational energy\nloss rate (\\dot{E}) of these neutron stars spans 5 decades, from ~3x10^{33}\nerg/s to 5x10^{38} erg/s, and the apparent efficiencies for conversion to\ngamma-ray emission range from ~0.1% to unity, although distance uncertainties\ncomplicate efficiency estimates. The pulse shapes show substantial diversity,\nbut roughly 75% of the gamma-ray pulse profiles have two peaks, separated by\n>0.2 of rotational phase. For most of the pulsars, gamma-ray emission appears\nto come mainly from the outer magnetosphere, while polar-cap emission remains\nplausible for a remaining few.

The long wavelength part of the\nspectrum contains a strong contribution from the starburst-heated cool dust;\nthis is used to effectively separate starburst-dominated Seyferts from those\ndominated by the active nuclear continuum. Within the latter category, the\nstrength of the active nuclear continuum drops rapidly beyond ~ 20 micron. On\naverage, type 2 Seyferts have weaker short-wavelength active nuclear continua\nas compared to type 1 Seyferts. Type 2 Seyferts can be divided into two types,\nthose with strong poly-cyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) bands and those\nwithout. The latter type show polarized broad emission lines in their optical\nspectra. The PAH-dominated type 2 Seyferts and Seyfert 1.8/1.9s show very\nsimilar mid-IR spectra.

Recently, computer\nsimulations favored Juttner's as the relativistic generalization of Maxwell's\ndistribution for d=1,2,3 spatial dimensions and pointed to an invariant\ntemperature. In this work we argue an invariant temperature naturally follows\nfrom manifest covariance. We present a new derivation of the manifestly\ncovariant Juttner's distribution and Equipartition Theorem. The standard\nprocedure to get the equilibrium distribution as a solution of the relativistic\nBoltzmann's equation is here adopted. However, contrary to previous analysis,\nwe use cartesian coordinates in d+1 momentum space, with d spatial components.\nThe use of the multiplication theorem of Bessel functions turns crucial to\nregain the known invariant form of Juttner's distribution. Since equilibrium\nkinetic theory results should agree with thermodynamics in the comoving frame\nto the gas the covariant pseudo-norm of a vector entering the distribution can\nbe identified with the reciprocal of temperature in such comoving frame. Then\nby combining the covariant statistical moments of Juttner's distribution a\nnovel form of the Equipartition Theorem is advanced which also accommodates the\ninvariant comoving temperature and it contains, as a particular case, a\nprevious not manifestly covariant form.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2009 22:14:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The\nscale where the transition takes places depends on the strength g of the\ninteraction between phi and a relativistic field varphi. We show that a g\n\\simeq 10^{-12} gives a generation scale E_gen simeq eV with a cross section\nsigma simeq 1 pb close to the WIMPs cross section sigma_w simeq pb at\ndecoupling. The number density n_phi of the \\phi particles are a source term in\nthe eq. of motion of phi and it generates the scalar potential v(phi)\nresponsible for the late time acceleration of our universe. Since the\nappearance of phi may be at very low scales, close to present time, the\ncosmological coincidence problem can be explained simply due to the size of the\ncoupling constant. We unify dark energy with inflation in terms of a single\nscalar field phi, and we use the same potential v for inflation and dark\nenergy. However, after inflation phi decays completely and reheats the universe\nat a scale E_RH propto h^2 m_Pl, where h is the coupling between the SM\nparticles and varphi. The field phi disappears from the spectrum during, from\nreheating until its re-generation, and therefore it does not interfere with the\nstandard decelerating radiation/matter cosmological model allowing for a\nsuccessful unification scheme. The same interaction term that gives rise to the\ninflaton decay accounts for the late time re-generation of phi.

(2009) is used to calculate the line emissivities for a modified\nMaxwellian distribution. We study metal abundances in galaxy groups and\nclusters where hard X-ray excess emission was observed. We found that for\nmodified Maxwellian distributions the argon abundance decreases for the HCG 62\ngroup, the iron abundance decreases for the Centaurus cluster and the oxygen\nabundance decreases for the solar corona with respect to the case of a\nMaxwellian distribution. Therefore, metal abundance measurements are a\npromising tool to test the presence of high energy electron populations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2009 01:12:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Here we do parametric calculations, based on the tight-binding\nmodel, to study the transport properties through such bridge systems. The\nelectron transport properties are significantly influenced by (a) number of\nquantized energy levels in the dots, (b) dot-to-electrode coupling strength,\n(c) location of the equilibrium Fermi energy $E_F$ and (d) surface disorder. In\nthe limit of weak-coupling, the conductance ($g$) shows sharp resonant peaks\nassociated with the quantized energy levels in the dots, while, they get\nsubstantial broadening in the strong-coupling limit. The behavior of the\nelectron transfer through these systems becomes much more clearly visible from\nour study of current-voltage ($I$-$V$) characteristics. In this context we also\ndescribe the noise power of current fluctuations ($S$) and determine the Fano\nfactor ($F$) which provides an important information about the electron\ncorrelation among the charge carriers. Finally, we explore a novel transport\nphenomenon by studying the surface disorder effect in which the current\namplitude increases with the increase of the surface disorder strength in the\nstrong disorder regime, while, the amplitude decreases in the limit of weak\ndisorder. Such an anomalous behavior is completely opposite to that of bulk\ndisordered system where the current amplitude always decreases with the\ndisorder strength. It is also observed that the current amplitude strongly\ndepends on the system size which reveals the finite quantum size effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2009 03:54:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

The continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) is one such\ngenerative model whose popularity extends to a variety of disciplines ranging\nfrom computational finance to human genetics and genomics. A common theme among\nthese diverse applications is the need to simulate sample paths of a CTMC\nconditional on realized data that is discretely observed. Here we present a\ngeneral solution to this sampling problem when the CTMC is defined on a\ndiscrete and finite state space. Specifically, we consider the generation of\nsample paths, including intermediate states and times of transition, from a\nCTMC whose beginning and ending states are known across a time interval of\nlength $T$. We first unify the literature through a discussion of the three\npredominant approaches: (1) modified rejection sampling, (2) direct sampling,\nand (3) uniformization. We then give analytical results for the complexity and\nefficiency of each method in terms of the instantaneous transition rate matrix\n$Q$ of the CTMC, its beginning and ending states, and the length of sampling\ntime $T$. In doing so, we show that no method dominates the others across all\nmodel specifications, and we give explicit proof of which method prevails for\nany given $Q,T,$ and endpoints. Finally, we introduce and compare three\napplications of CTMCs to demonstrate the pitfalls of choosing an inefficient\nsampler.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2009 08:49:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-12"}

Whenever this is the\ncase, one prefers the causal model X--> Y.\n  Here we justify this method by showing that the causal hypothesis Y--> X is\nunlikely because it requires a specific tuning between P(Y) and P(X|Y) to\ngenerate a distribution that admits an additive noise model from X to Y. To\nquantify the amount of tuning required we derive lower bounds on the\nalgorithmic information shared by P(Y) and P(X|Y). This way, our justification\nis consistent with recent approaches for using algorithmic information theory\nfor causal reasoning.

We use the IBIS/ISGRI telescope on-board INTEGRAL to measure the\nposition of the centroid of the 20-200 keV emission from the Crab region.\nMethods. We find that the astrometry of the IBIS telescope is affected by the\ntemperature of the IBIS mask during the observation. After correcting for this\neffect, we show that the systematic errors in the astrometry of the telescope\nare of the order of 0.5 arcsec. In the case of the Crab nebula and several\nother bright sources, the very large number of photons renders the level of\nstatistical uncertainty in the centroid smaller or comparable to this value.\nResults. We find that the centroid of the Crab nebula in hard X-rays (20-40\nkeV) is shifted by 8.0 arcsec with respect to the Crab pulsar in the direction\nof the X-ray centroid of the nebula. A similar shift is also found at higher\nenergies (40-100 and 100-200 keV). We observe a trend of decreasing shift with\nenergy, which can be explained by an increase in the pulsed fraction. To\ndifferentiate between the contribution of the pulsar and the nebula, we divide\nour data into an on-pulse and off-pulse sample. Surprisingly, the nebular\nemission (i.e., off-pulse) is located significantly away from the X-ray\ncentroid of the nebula. Conclusions. In all 3 energy bands (20-40, 40-100, and\n100-200 keV), we find that the centroid of the nebula is significantly offset\nfrom the predicted position. We interpret this shift in terms of a cut-off in\nthe electron spectrum in the outer regions of the nebula, which is probably the\norigin of the observed spectral break around 100 keV. From a simple\nspherically-symmetric model for the nebula, we estimate that the electrons in\nthe external regions of the torus (d ~ 0.35 pc from the pulsar) reach a maximal\nenergy slightly below 10^14 eV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2009 09:56:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2009 15:31:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

In its widest sense, closure is associated with the\nsearch for self-contained levels of description on which time-evolution\nequations can be formulated in a closed, or autonomous, form. Proper closure\nrequires the identification of the relevant structural variables participating\nin the dominant processes in a system of interest, and closure hence is\nsynonymous with focusing on the essence of a problem and consequently with deep\nunderstanding. The derivation of closed equations may or may not be accompanied\nby the elimination of fast processes in favor of dissipation.

Here we\npresent a molecular dynamics simulation of a peptide composed of nine arginines\n(Arg-9) that shows that this peptide follows the same translocation pathway\npreviously found for the Tat peptide. We test this hypothesis experimentally by\nmeasuring ionic currents across phospholipid bilayers and cell membranes\nthrough the pores induced by Arg-9 peptides. We find that Arg-9 peptides, in\nthe presence of an electrostatic potential gradient, induce ionic currents\nacross planar phospholipid bilayers, as well as in cultured osteosarcoma cells\nand human smooth muscle cells freshly isolated from the umbilical artery.

A mosaic of 13 fields was observed in the CO(1-0) line with\nthe IRAM-PdB interferometer in the translucent environment of two low-mass\ndense cores. The large size of the mosaic compared to the resolution (4 arcsec)\nis unprecedented in the study of the small-scale structure of diffuse molecular\ngas. Eight weak and elongated structures of thicknesses as small as 3 mpc (600\nAU) and lengths up to 70mpc are found. These are not filaments because once\nmerged with short-spacing data, they appear as the sharp edges of larger-scale\nstructures. Six out of eight form quasi-parallel pairs at different velocities\nand different position angles. This cannot be the result of chance alignment.\nThe velocity-shears estimated for the three pairs include the highest ever\nmeasured far from star forming regions (780 km/s/pc). Because the large scale\nstructures have sharp edges, with little or no overlap, they have to be thin\nCO-layers. Their edges mark a sharp transition between a CO-rich component and\na gas undetected in the CO line because of its low CO abundance, presumably the\ncold neutral medium. We propose that these sharp edges are the first\ndirectly-detected manifestations of the intermittency of interstellar\nturbulence.

Instead, the mass ratio distribution is broadly consistent with\nthe scenario of binary formation via disk fragmentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2009 15:29:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2009 16:07:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

It is well established that,\nfor straight uniform motion, no steady waves appear at velocities below the\nminimum phase velocity $c_\\text{min} = 23 {\\rm cm/s}$. At higher velocities the\nemission of capillary-gravity waves creates an additional drag force. The\nbehavior of this force near the critical velocity is still poorly understood. A\nlinear response theory where the object is replaced by an effective pressure\nsource predicts a singular behavior for the wave drag.

In this article, we show\nthat a proper treatment of the flow equations around the obstacle can\nregularize wave emission, even in the linear wave approximation, thereby\nensuring a continuous behavior of the drag force.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2009 15:23:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2010 17:30:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-13"}

Using full\nthree-dimensional numerical simulations, we observe the collapse induced by\nlocal density fluctuations. For the purpose of future experiments, we present\nthe time dependence of the density distribution, energy per particle and the\nmaximal density of the condensate.

The developed macroscopic theory of phase transitions with\nspontaneous symmetry breaking is applied to the analysis of possible \"thick\"\nbrane structures. The previous considerations were done using the order\nparameter in the form of a multiplet in a target space of scalar fields. The\ndifference of these two approaches is analyzed and demonstrated in detail.\n  There are two different symmetries of regular solutions of Einstein equations\nfor a hedgehog type vector order parameter. Both solutions are analyzed in\nparallel analytically and numerically. Regular configurations in cases of\nvector order parameter have one more free parameter in comparison with the\nscalar multiplet solutions. It is shown that the existence of a negative\ncosmological constant is sufficient for the spontaneous symmetry breaking of\nthe initially plain bulk. Regular configurations have a growing gravitational\npotential and are able to trap the matter to the brane. Among others there are\nsolutions with the gravitational potential having several points of minimum.\nIdentical in the uniform bulk spin-less particles, being trapped within\nseparate points of minimum, acquire different masses and appear to an observer\nwithin the brane as different particles with integer spins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2009 15:25:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-15"}
