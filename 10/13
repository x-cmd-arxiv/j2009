Using three-dimensional direct numerical simulations (DNS)\nof forced turbulence we show that an imposed mean magnetic field leads to a\ndecrease of the turbulent hydromagnetic pressure and tension. This phenomenon\nis quantified by determining the relevant functions that relate the sum of the\nturbulent Reynolds and Maxwell stresses with the Maxwell stress of the mean\nmagnetic field. Using such a parameterization, we show by means of\ntwo-dimensional and three-dimensional mean-field numerical modelling that an\nisentropic density stratified layer becomes unstable in the presence of a\nuniform imposed magnetic field. This large-scale instability results in the\nformation of loop-like magnetic structures which are concentrated at the top of\nthe stratified layer. In three dimensions these structures resemble the\nappearance of bipolar magnetic regions in the Sun. The results of DNS and\nmean-field numerical modelling are in good agreement with theoretical\npredictions. We discuss our model in the context of a distributed solar dynamo\nwhere active regions and sunspots might be rather shallow phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2009 19:53:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-03"}

(2) What is the origin of the\ntwo-dimensionality of the normal state? Specifically, based on the t-J model,\nwe derive a renormalized Hamiltonian to describe the properties of underdoped\ncuprates. The theory is constrained to agree with the behavior at half filling,\nwhich is well described by the bosonic RVB state of Arovas and Auerbach. Moving\nholes are assumed to destroy long-range magnetic order, which leads to a gap in\nthe spinon spectrum. The presence of the spin gap allows us to derive a\nconstrained Hamiltonian which describes sublattice-preserving hopping by\nrenormalized holons and holon pairs, accompanied by spinon singlet backflows.\nBelow the singlet condensation, i.e, the psudogap (as distinct from the spin\ngap), temperature T*, holons form a spinless Fermi liquid without an observable\nsmall Fermi surface. Above T* holons are localized, giving rise to a (gauge)\ninsulator, which we identify with the strange metal phase. Holon pair hopping\nleads to a robust d-wave superconductor, its symmetry determined primarily by\nthe symmetry of the RVB state at half filling. The predictions of the theory\nare shown to be consistent with the results of nmr, tunneling and transport\nexperiments. Remarkably, the existence of the spin gap provides a natural\nexplanation for the two-dimensionality of the normal state.

Band structure calculations confirm the\nidentification of ferromagnetic J(1), J(1)' and antiferromagnetic J(2), J(2)'\nin PbZnVO(PO4)2 and yield J(1)'-J(1) ~ 1.1 K in excellent agreement with the\nexperimental value of 1.1 K, deduced from the difference between the expected\nand experimentally measured saturation fields. Based on the comparison of\nlayered vanadium phosphates with different metal cations, we show that a\nmoderate spatial anisotropy of the frustrated square lattice has minor\ninfluence on the thermodynamic properties of the model. We discuss relevant\ngeometrical parameters, controlling the exchange interactions in these\ncompounds, and propose a new route towards strongly frustrated square lattice\nmaterials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2009 21:54:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-28"}

In this work, we propose a boosting-based\ntechnique, termed \\BoostMetric, for learning a Mahalanobis distance metric. One\nof the primary difficulties in learning such a metric is to ensure that the\nMahalanobis matrix remains positive semidefinite. Semidefinite programming is\nsometimes used to enforce this constraint, but does not scale well.\n\\BoostMetric is instead based on a key observation that any positive\nsemidefinite matrix can be decomposed into a linear positive combination of\ntrace-one rank-one matrices. \\BoostMetric thus uses rank-one positive\nsemidefinite matrices as weak learners within an efficient and scalable\nboosting-based learning process. The resulting method is easy to implement,\ndoes not require tuning, and can accommodate various types of constraints.\nExperiments on various datasets show that the proposed algorithm compares\nfavorably to those state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy\nand running time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2009 00:54:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-14"}

Specifically, we study the optimal BD precoder design to maximize the\nweighted sum-rate of all the MSs subject to a set of per-BS power constraints.\nThis design problem is formulated in an auxiliary MIMO broadcast channel (BC)\nwith a set of transmit power constraints corresponding to those for individual\nBSs in the multi-cell system. By applying convex optimization techniques, this\npaper develops an efficient algorithm to solve this problem, and derives the\nclosed-form expression for the optimal BD precoding matrix.

Finally we show that a quantum phase transition of a different\nnature, but displaying similar characteristics, may arise also within a single\nchain just by including higher order terms in the hamiltonian.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2009 09:21:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

Offering a\nhigh contrast in intensity with respect to the background (either bright in\nemission if observed at the limb, or dark in absorption if observed on disk)\nthese cool blobs are often observed falling down from high coronal heights\nabove active regions. A physical explanation for this spectacular phenomenon\nhas been put forward thanks to numerical simulations of loops with footpoint\nconcentrated heating, a heating scenario in which cool condensations naturally\nform in the corona. This effect has been termed 'catastrophic cooling' and is\nthe predominant explanation for coronal rain. In this work we further\ninvestigate the link between this phenomenon and the heating mechanisms acting\nin the corona. We start by analyzing observations of coronal rain at the limb\nin the Ca II H line performed by the SOT instrument on board of the Hinode\nsatellite. We then compare the observations with 1.5-dimensional MHD\nsimulations of loops being heated by small-scale discrete events concentrated\ntowards the footpoints (that could come, for instance, from magnetic\nreconnection events), and by Alfven waves generated at the photosphere. It is\nfound that if a loop is heated predominantly from Alfven waves coronal rain is\ninhibited due to the characteristic uniform heating they produce. Hence coronal\nrain may not only point to the spatial distribution of the heating in coronal\nloops but also to the agent of the heating itself. We thus propose coronal rain\nas a marker for coronal heating mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2009 12:51:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

The model assumes that the residential agent, located in the neighborhood\nwhere the fraction of 'friends' is less than a predefined threshold value F,\ntries to relocate to a neighborhood for which this fraction is above F. It is\nwell known that for the equal groups, depending on F, Schelling's residential\npattern converges either to complete integration (random pattern) or\nsegregation. We investigate Schelling model pattern dynamics as dependent on F,\nthe ratio of the group numbers and the size of the neighborhood and demonstrate\nthat the traditional integrate-segregate dichotomy is incomplete.

We also\ndemonstrate that Schelling model dynamics essentially depends on the\ndescription of agents' residential behavior.

At low\nredshifts, the average correction is not zero but decays with the peculiar\nvelocities and redshift. Its upper bound is provided by the maximal average\ncorrection which assumes no random cancelations between different voids. It is\ndescribed well by a linear perturbation formula and, for the voids considered,\nis 20% of the correction corresponding to the maximal peculiar velocity. The\naverage correction calculated in random and simple cubic void lattices is\nseverely damped below the predicted maximal one after a single void diameter.\nThat is traced to cancellations between the corrections from the fronts and\nbacks of different voids. All that implies that voids cannot imitate the effect\nof dark energy unless they have radii and peculiar velocities much larger than\nthe currently observed. The results obtained allow one to readily predict the\nredshift above which the direction-averaged fluctuation in the Hubble diagram\nfalls below a required precision and suggest a method to extract the background\nHubble constant from low redshift data without the need to correct for peculiar\nvelocities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2009 22:54:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2009 13:36:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 25 Mar 2010 02:07:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}
