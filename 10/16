But as these surveys become more\nambitious, and as we seek to perform increasingly accurate measurements, it\nbecomes crucial to take proper account of the photometric redshift\nuncertainties. Ideally the uncertainties can be directly measured using a\ncomparison to spectroscopic redshifts, but this may yield misleading results\nsince spectroscopic samples are frequently small and not representative of the\nparent photometric samples. We present a simple and powerful empirical method\nto constrain photometric redshift uncertainties in the absence of spectroscopic\nredshifts. Close pairs of galaxies on the sky have a significant probability of\nbeing physically associated, and therefore of lying at nearly the same\nredshift. The difference in photometric redshifts in close pairs is therefore a\nmeasure of the redshift uncertainty. Some observed close pairs will arise from\nchance projections along the line of sight, but it is straightforward to\nperform a statistical correction for this effect. We demonstrate the technique\nusing both simulated data and actual observations, and discuss how its\nusefulness can be limited by the presence of systematic photometric redshift\nerrors. Finally, we use this technique to show how photometric redshift\naccuracy can depend on galaxy type.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2009 19:34:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-23"}

The model introduces Lya radiative\ntransfer as the single factor for transforming the intrinsic Lya emission\nproperties into the observed ones. Spatial diffusion of Lya photons from\nradiative transfer results in extended Lya emission and only the central part\nwith high surface brightness can be observed. Because of radiative transfer,\nthe appearance of LAEs depends on density and velocity structures in\ncircumgalactic and intergalactic media as well as the viewing angle, which\nleads to a broad distribution of apparent (observed) Lya luminosity for a given\nintrinsic Lya luminosity. Radiative transfer also causes frequency diffusion of\nLya photons. The resultant Lya line is asymmetric with a red tail. The peak of\nthe Lya line shifts towards longer wavelength and the shift is anti-correlated\nwith the apparent to intrinsic Lya luminosity ratio. The simple radiative\ntransfer model provides a new framework for studying LAEs. It is able to\nexplain an array of observed properties of z~5.7 LAEs in Ouchi et al. (2008),\nproducing Lya spectra, morphology, and apparent Lya luminosity function (LF)\nsimilar to those seen in observation. The broad distribution of apparent Lya\nluminosity at fixed UV luminosity provides a natural explanation for the\nobserved UV LF, especially the turnover towards the low luminosity end. The\nmodel also reproduces the observed distribution of Lya equivalent width (EW)\nand explains the deficit of UV bright, high EW sources. Because of the broad\ndistribution of the apparent to intrinsic Lya luminosity ratio, the model\npredicts effective duty cycles and Lya escape fractions for LAEs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2009 18:18:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 24 Apr 2010 04:09:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

While this works in some applications, the model\nfails when one is interested in discovering {\\it changes in scene dynamics}\nrather than those in a static background; detection of unusual pedestrian and\nmotor traffic patterns is but one example. We propose a new model and\ncomputational framework that address this failure by considering stationary\nscene dynamics as a ``background'' with which observed scene dynamics are\ncompared. Central to our approach is the concept of an {\\it event}, that we\ndefine as short-term scene dynamics captured over a time window at a specific\nspatial location in the camera field of view. We compute events by\ntime-aggregating motion labels, obtained by background subtraction, as well as\nobject descriptors (e.g., object size).

Thanks to the approximately 2 year long baseline of data, we can\nconstrain the magnetic field of the neutron star to be 0.4x10^8 G < B < 9x10^8\nG, which is within the range of typical accreting millisecond pulsars. The 2009\ntiming analysis allows us to put constraints on the accretion torque: the spin\nfrequency derivative within the outburst has an upper limit of $|\\dot{\\nu}| <\n3x10^-13 Hz/s at the 95% confidence level. A study of pulse profiles and their\nevolution during the outburst is analyzed, suggesting a systematic change of\nshape that depends on the outburst phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2009 16:10:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The extent to which M31's\nsatellites have left battle scars upon it is unknown; to answer this we need\naccurate orbits and masses of the perturbers. I focus here on M31's\n150-kpc-long Giant Southern Stream (GSS) as an example of how these can be\ndetermined even in the absence of a visible progenitor. Comparing N-body models\nto photometric and spectroscopic data, I find this stream resulted from the\ndisruption of a large satellite galaxy by a close passage about 750 Myr ago.\nThe GSS is connected to several other debris structures in M31's halo. Bayesian\nsampling of the simulations estimates the progenitor's initial mass as\nlog(Mstar/Msun) = 9.5 +- 0.2, showing it was one of the most massive Local\nGroup galaxies until quite recently. The stream model constrains M31's halo\nmass to be (1.8+-0.5)x10^{12} Msun. While these small uncertainties neglect\nseveral important degrees of freedom, they are likely to remain good even with\na more complete model.

High\nquality spectra (S/N>50 and R~8A) of H$\\alpha$ and H$\\beta$ were investigated.\nWe analyzed line profile variations during monitoring period. Comparing the\nline profiles of H$\\alpha$ and H$\\beta$, we studied different details (bumps,\nabsorption features) in the line profiles. The variations of the different\nH$\\alpha$ and H$\\beta$ line profile segments have been investigated. Also, we\nanalyzed the Balmer decrement for whole line and for line segments. We found\nthat the line profiles were strongly changing during the monitoring period,\nshowing blue and red asymmetries. This indicates a complex BLR geometry of NGC\n4151 with, at least, three kinematically distinct regions: one that contributes\nto the blue line wing, one to the line core and one to the red line wing. Such\nvariation can be caused by an accelerating outflow starting very close to the\nblack hole, where the red part may come from the region {closer to the black\nhole than the blue part, which is coming} from the region having the highest\noutflow velocities. Taking into account the fact that the BLR of NGC 4151 has a\ncomplex geometry (probably affected by an outflow) and that a portion of the\nbroad line emission seems to have not a pure photoionization origin, one can\nask the question whether the study of the BLR by reverberation mapping may be\nvalid in the case of this galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2009 20:43:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Here we use these data to estimate projected\nautocorrelation functions w_p(r_p) for the light of galaxies in the five SDSS\nphotometric bands. Comparison with the analogous stellar mass autocorrelation,\nestimated in a previous paper, shows that stellar luminosity is less strongly\nclustered than stellar mass in all bands and on all scales. Over the full\nnonlinear range 10 kpc/h < r_p < 10 Mpc/h our autocorrelation estimates are\nextremely well represented by power laws. The parameters of the corresponding\nspatial functions \\xi(r) = (r/r_0)^\\gamma vary systematically from r_0=4.5\nMpc/h and \\gamma=-1.74 for the bluest band (the u band) to r_0=5.8 Mpc/h and\n\\gamma=-1.83 for the reddest one (the z band). These may be compared with\nr_0=6.1 Mpc/h and \\gamma=-1.84 for the stellar mass. Ratios of w_p(r_p) between\ntwo given wavebands are proportional to the mean colour of correlated stars at\nprojected distance r_p from a randomly chosen star. The ratio of the stellar\nmass and luminosity autocorrelations measures an analogous mean stellar\nmass-to-light ratio (M*/L). All colours get redder and all mass-to-light ratios\nget larger with decreasing r_p, with the amplitude of the effects decreasing\nstrongly to redder passbands. Even for the u-band the effects are quite modest,\nwith maximum shifts of about 0.1 in u-g and about 25% in M*/L_u.

A catalog is presented of 414\ndiffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) measured between 3900 and 8100 A in this\nspectrum.

The principal result of this study is that the great majority of the\nbands in the catalog are very weak and fairly narrow.

We consider two crystalline substrates, SiO2 (or alpha-quartz)\nand Al2O3 (alpha-alumina or sapphire), each with two surface terminations. We\nfocus on the role of substrate surface dangling states and their passivation in\nperturbing the linear energy spectrum of graphene. On non-passivated surface\nterminations, with the relaxation of top surface layers, only Si-terminated\nquartz retains the linear band structure of graphene due to relatively large\nequilibrium separation from the graphene layer whereas the other three surface\nterminations considerably distort it. However, without relaxations of the top\nsurface layer atoms, linear bands appear in the electronic spectrum but with\nthe Dirac point shifted away from the Fermi level. Interestingly, with a second\ncarbon layer on non-passivated oxygen terminated Quartz, with top surface\nlayers relaxation, graphene features appear in the spectrum but sapphire with\nboth surface terminations shows perturbed features even with two carbon layers.\nBy passivating the surface dangling states with hydrogen atoms and without top\nlayer atomic relaxations, the electron-hole symmetry occurs exactly at the\nFermi level. This suggests that surface dangling states play a less important\nrole than the atomic relaxations of the top surface layers in distorting the\nlinear spectrum. In all cases we find that the first layer of graphene forms\nripples, much like in suspended graphene, but the strength of rippling is found\nto be weaker probably due to the presence of the substrate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2009 21:32:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2010 22:08:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-29"}

We\nemploy the photoionization code XSTAR to compute the ionic abundances of a\nlarge number of ions of different elements and then compile their line-of-sight\n(LOS) absorption columns. Particular attention is paid to the absorption\nmeasure distribution (AMD), namely their Hydrogen-equivalent column per\nlogarithmic ionization parameter \\xi interval, d N_H/(d \\log \\xi), which\nprovides a measure of the winds' radial density profiles. For n(r)~1/r the AMD\nis found to be independent of \\xi, in good agreement with its behavior inferred\nfrom the X-ray spectra of several AGNs.

The probability of obscuration of the X-ray\nionizing source in these winds decreases with increasing \\dot{m} and increases\nsteeply with \\theta. As such, we concur with previous authors that these wind\nconfigurations, viewed globally, incorporate all the requisite properties of\nthe parsec scale \"torii\" invoked in AGN unification schemes. We indicate that a\ncombination of the AMD and absorption line profile observations can uniquely\ndetermine these model parameters and their bearing on AGN population\ndemographics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2009 21:35:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Apr 2010 18:41:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

The fragile state separates the two conditions that define $\\phi_c$\nwith an exponential rise in pressure starting at $\\phi_1$ and an exponential\nfall in disk displacements ending at $\\phi_2$.

This phenomenon of reversible quantum tunneling\nbetween two classically separable states, known as Macroscopic Quantum\nCoherence (MQC), is regarded crucial for precision tests of whether macroscopic\nsystems such as circuits fully obey quantum mechanics. In this article, we\nreport the observation of such oscillations with sub-GHz frequency and quality\nfactor larger than 500. We achieved this result with two innovations. First,\nour ring has an inductance four orders of magnitude larger than that considered\nby Leggett, combined with a junction in the charging regime, a parameter choice\nnever addressed in previous experiments. Second, readout is performed with a\nnovel dispersive scheme which eliminates the electromagnetic relaxation process\ninduced by the measurement circuit (Purcell effect). Moreover, the reset of the\nsystem to its ground state is naturally built into this scheme, working even if\nthe transition energy is smaller than that of temperature fluctuations. As we\nargue, the MQC transition could therefore be, contrary to expectations, the\nbasis of a superconducting qubit of improved coherence and readout fidelity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 2009 06:27:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-19"}

The spine is an isolated field\nline which approaches the null (or recedes from it), while the fan is a surface\nof field lines which recede from it (or approach it).\n  So-called \"torsional spine reconnection\" occurs when field lines in the\nvicinity of the fan rotate, with current becoming concentrated along the spine,\nso that nearby field lines undergo rotational slippage. In \"torsional fan\nreconnection\" field lines near the spine rotate and create a current that is\nconcentrated in the fan with a rotational flux mismatch and rotational\nslippage. In both of these regimes, the spine and fan are perpendicular and\nthere is no flux transfer across spine or fan. The third regime, called\n\"spine-fan reconnection\", is the most common in practice and combines elements\nof the previous spine and fan models. In this case, in response to a generic\nshearing motion, the null point collapses to form a current sheet that is\nfocused at the null itself, in a sheet that locally spans both the spine and\nfan.

For plausible water abundances (3-5 times solar on Jupiter/Saturn\nand 30 times solar on Uranus/Neptune), our simulations produce ~20 zonal jets\nfor Jupiter and Saturn and 3 zonal jets on Uranus and Neptune, similar to the\nnumber of jets observed on these planets. Moreover, these Jupiter/Saturn cases\nproduce equatorial superrotation whereas the Uranus/Neptune cases produce\nequatorial subrotation,consistent with the observed equatorial jet direction on\nthese planets.Sensitivity tests show that water abundance, planetary rotation\nrate,and planetary radius are all controlling factors, with water playing the\nmost important role; modest water abundances, large planetary radii, and fast\nrotation rates favor equatorial superrotation, whereas large water abundances\nfavor equatorial subrotation regardless of the planetary radius and rotation\nrate. Given the larger radii, faster rotation rates, and probable lower water\nabundances of Jupiter and Saturn relative to Uranus and Neptune, our\nsimulations therefore provide a possible mechanism for the existence of\nequatorial superrotation on Jupiter and Saturn and the lack of superrotation on\nUranus and Neptune.

This pulsar is most\nlikely associated with the bright Chandra X-ray point source lying at the\ncenter of G310.6-1.6, a previously unrecognised Galactic composite supernova\nremnant with a bright central non-thermal radio and X-ray nebula, taken to be\nthe pulsar wind nebula (PWN). PSR J1400-6325 is amongst the most energetic\nrotation-powered pulsars in the Galaxy, with a spin-down luminosity of Edot =\n5.1E+37 erg.s-1. In the rotating dipole model, the surface dipole magnetic\nfield strength is B_s = 1.1E+12 G and the characteristic age tau_c = P/2Pdot =\n12.7 kyr. The high spin-down power is consistent with the hard spectral indices\nof the pulsar and the nebula of 1.22 +/- 0.15 and 1.83 +/- 0.08, respectively,\nand a 2-10 keV flux ratio F_PWN/F_PSR ~ 8. Follow-up Parkes observations\nresulted in the detection of radio emission at 10 and 20 cm from PSR J1400-6325\nat a dispersion measure of ~ 560 cm-3 pc, which implies a relatively large\ndistance of 10 +/- 3 kpc.

The\nmassive Wilson coefficients in the asymptotic region are given as convolutions\nof massive operator matrix elements (OMEs) and the known light flavor Wilson\ncoefficients. The former derive from the twist--2 operators emerging in the\nlight--cone--expansion and are calculated at the 3--loop level for fixed\nmoments. We also compute the massive OMEs which are needed to evaluate heavy\nflavor parton distributions in the variable flavor number scheme to the same\norder. All contributions to the Wilson coefficients and OMEs but the genuine\nconstant terms at O(a_s^3) of the OMEs are derived in terms of quantities,\nwhich are known for general values in the Mellin variable N. For the OMEs\nA_{Qg}^(3), A_{qg,Q}^(3) and A_{gg,Q}^(3) the moments N = 2 to 10, for\nA_{Qq}^{(3), PS} to N = 12, and for A_{qq,Q}^{(3), NS}, A_{qq,Q}^{(3), PS},\nA_{gq,Q}^(3)}to N=14 are computed. These terms contribute to the light flavor\n'+'-combinations. For the flavor non-singlet terms, we calculate as well the\nodd moments N=1 to 13, corresponding to the light flavor '-'-combinations. We\nalso obtain moments of the terms ~ T_F of the 3-loop anomalous dimensions in an\nindependent calculation, which agree with results given in the literature.

The novelty of quantum\ncryptography is that whenever a spy tries to eavesdrop the communication he\ncauses disturbances in the transmission of the message. Ultimately this\nunavoidable disturbance is a consequence of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle\nthat limits the joint knowledge of complementary observables. Now, a problem\nremains: in order to initialize quantum key distribution, Alice and Bob need to\nshare a short shared key in order to be able to identify each other\nunambiguously. Therefore a trusted courier is needed. We propose in this paper\na solution to the trusted courrier problem that was inspired by quantum\ncryptography. The idea is to encode the key that Alice sends to Bob into\nunstable nuclei in such a way that the message gets revealed only after the\ncourrier has delivered it to Bob. In this approach, we replace Heisenberg\nuncertainties by another type of uncertainty, that characterizes the knowledge\nof the time at which an unstable nucleus decays. As we shall show, this scheme\nmakes it possible to refresh a key even in the case that we do not trust the\ncourier who carries the key.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 2009 14:35:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-19"}
