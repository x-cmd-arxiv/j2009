In\nrotational delivery, the beam is on while the gantry is rotating and the MLC\nleaves are moving, thus treating the patient more efficiently (regarding time)\nthan in IMRT. A consideration that should be examined when evaluating this new\ntype of delivery method is the tradeoff between treatment plan quality and\ndelivery time: what do we sacrifice in terms of plan quality by guaranteeing a\n2 minute delivery, for example? In this paper we examine this question by\nstudying a simplified 2D phantom where leaf and gantry motion are directly\nincluded in the optimization model. We formulate the model as a linear mixed\ninteger program. Because of the difficulty in solving to optimality, we employ\nadditional models which allow us to trap the true optimal solution between\nupper and lower bounds. The lower bound solutions reveal which beam directions\nare most useful for treatment (i.e. where the gantry should slow down), and\nthis information is used to produce deliverable solutions close to the lower\nbound solutions.

While\nthese are the best characterized networks in living systems, understanding\ntheir evolutionary history and complex wiring constitutes one of the most\nfascinating open questions in biology, intimately related to the enigma of\nlife's origin itself. Is the evolution of metabolism subject to general\nprinciples, beyond the unpredictable accumulation of multiple historical\naccidents? Here we search for such principles by applying to an artificial\nchemical universe some of the methodologies developed for the study of genome\nscale models of cellular metabolism. In particular, we use metabolic flux\nconstraint-based models to exhaustively search for artificial chemistry\npathways that can optimally perform an array of elementary metabolic functions.\nDespite the simplicity of the model employed, we find that the ensuing pathways\ndisplay a surprisingly rich set of properties, including the existence of\nautocatalytic cycles and hierarchical modules, the appearance of universally\npreferable metabolites and reactions, and a logarithmic trend of pathway length\nas a function of input/output molecule size. Some of these properties can be\nderived analytically, borrowing methods previously used in cryptography. In\naddition, by mapping biochemical networks onto a simplified carbon atom\nreaction backbone, we find that several of the properties predicted by the\nartificial chemistry model hold for real metabolic networks. These findings\nsuggest that optimality principles and arithmetic simplicity might lie beneath\nsome aspects of biochemical complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2009 19:47:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Apr 2010 14:49:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-05"}

Thermal coupling to the tachocline, baroclinic effects and\nlatitudinal transport of heat have been advocated to explain this peculiar\nstate of rotation. Aims: To test the validity of thermal wind balance in the\nsolar convection zone using helioseismic inversions for both the angular\nvelocity and fluctuations in entropy and temperature. Methods: Entropy and\ntemperature fluctuations obtained from 3-D hydrodynamical numerical simulations\nof the solar convection zone are compared with solar profiles obtained from\nhelioseismic inversions. Results: The temperature and entropy fluctuations in\n3-D numerical simulations have smaller amplitude in the bulk of the solar\nconvection zone than those found from seismic inversions.

Within growing neutrino\nmodels the coupling becomes effective only in recent times, when neutrinos\nbecome non-relativistic, stopping the evolution of the cosmon. This can explain\nwhy dark energy dominates the universe only in a rather recent epoch by\nrelating the present dark energy density to the small mass of neutrinos. Such\nmodels predict the presence of stable neutrino lumps at supercluster scales\n(~200 Mpc and bigger), caused by an attractive force between neutrinos which is\nstronger than gravity and mediated by the cosmon.

The effect is particularly pronounced if the\nstatistical non-Gaussianity is inherently large, such as in models of inflation\nwith a small speed of sound, e.g. DBI. First reviewing the motivations for a\nmodified vacuum, we calculate the non-Gaussianity for a general action with a\nsmall speed of sound. The shape of its bispectrum is found to most resemble the\n'orthogonal' or 'local' templates depending on the phase of the Bogolyubov\nparameter. In particular, for DBI models of inflation the bispectrum can have a\nprofound 'local' template feature, in contrast to previous results. Determining\nthe projection into the observational templates allows us to derive constraints\non the absolute value of the Bogolyubov parameter. In the small sound speed\nlimit, the derived constraints are generally stronger than the existing\nconstraint derived from the power spectrum. The bound on the absolute value of\nthe Bogolyubov parameter ranges from the 10^-6 to the 10^-3 level for\nH/\\Lambda_c = 10^-3, depending on the specific details of the model, the sound\nspeed and the phase of the Bogolyubov parameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2009 13:15:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2009 16:15:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-05"}

The\nevolution of the central accretion rate exhibits phases reminiscent of the long\nGRB gamma-ray and X-ray light curve, which lends support to the proposal that\nthe luminosity is modulated by the central accretion rate. After a few tens of\nseconds, an accretion shock sweeps outward through the star. The formation and\noutward expansion of the accretion shock is accompanied with a sudden and rapid\npower-law decline in the central accretion rate Mdot ~ t^{-2.8}, which\nresembles the L_X ~ t^{-3} decline observed in the X-ray light curves. The\ncollapsed, shock-heated stellar envelope settles into a thick, low-mass\nequatorial disk embedded within a massive, pressure-supported atmosphere. After\na few hundred seconds, the inflow of low-angular-momentum material in the axial\nfunnel reverses into an outflow from the surface of the thick disk. Meanwhile,\nthe rapid decline of the accretion rate slows down, or even settles a in steady\nstate with Mdot ~ 5x10^{-5} Msun/s, which resembles the \"plateau\" phase in the\nX-ray light curve. While the duration of the \"prompt\" phase depends on the\nresolution in our simulations, we provide an analytical model taking into\naccount neutrino losses that estimates the duration to be ~20 s. The model\nsuggests that the steep decline in GRB X-ray light curves is triggered by the\ncircularization of the infalling stellar envelope at radii where the virial\ntemperature is below ~10^{10} K, such that neutrino cooling shuts off and an\noutward expansion of the accretion shock becomes imminent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2009 21:44:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

A\nparticularly challenging instance of this problem occurs in the case when the\ndegradation phenomenon is modeled by an ill-conditioned operator. In such a\ncase, the presence of noise makes it impossible to recover a valuable\napproximation of the image of interest without using some a priori information\nabout its properties. Such a priori information is essential for image\nrestoration, rendering it stable and robust to noise. Particularly, if the\noriginal image is known to be a piecewise smooth function, one of the standard\npriors used in this case is defined by the Rudin-Osher-Fatemi model, which\nresults in total variation (TV) based image restoration. The current arsenal of\nalgorithms for TV-based image restoration is vast. In the present paper, a\ndifferent approach to the solution of the problem is proposed based on the\nmethod of iterative shrinkage (aka iterated thresholding). In the proposed\nmethod, the TV-based image restoration is performed through a recursive\napplication of two simple procedures, viz. linear filtering and soft\nthresholding. Therefore, the method can be identified as belonging to the group\nof first-order algorithms which are efficient in dealing with images of\nrelatively large sizes. Another valuable feature of the proposed method\nconsists in its working directly with the TV functional, rather then with its\nsmoothed versions. Moreover, the method provides a single solution for both\nisotropic and anisotropic definitions of the TV functional, thereby\nestablishing a useful connection between the two formulae.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2009 22:50:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

We find a strong correlation with a non-unity slope between shifts in real\nspace and in redshift space and a weak correlation between the initial redshift\nand low redshift. Density-field reconstruction not only removes the mean shifts\nand reduces errors on the mean, but also tightens the correlations: after\nreconstruction, we recover a slope of near unity for the correlation between\nthe real and redshift space and restore a strong correlation between the low\nand the initial redshifts. We derive propagators and mode-coupling terms from\nour N-body simulations and compared with Zeldovich approximation and the shifts\nmeasured from the chi^2 fitting, respectively. We interpret the propagator and\nthe mode-coupling term of a nonlinear density field in the context of an\naverage and a dispersion of its complex Fourier coefficients relative to those\nof the linear density field; from these two terms, we derive a signal-to-noise\nratio of the acoustic peak measurement. We attempt to improve our\nreconstruction method by implementing 2LPT and iterative operations: we obtain\nlittle improvement. The Fisher matrix estimates of uncertainty in the acoustic\nscale is tested using 5000 (Gpc/h)^3 of cosmological PM simulations from\nTakahashi et al. (2009).

The complexity associated with a richly scattering\nenvironment implies that the short-term fading process is inherently hard to\npredict and best modeled stochastically, with rapid decorrelation properties in\nspace, time and frequency. In this paper, we demonstrate how the channel state\nbetween a wireless transmitter and receiver can be used as the basis for\nbuilding practical secret key generation protocols between two entities. We\nbegin by presenting a scheme based on level crossings of the fading process,\nwhich is well-suited for the Rayleigh and Rician fading models associated with\na richly scattering environment. Our level crossing algorithm is simple, and\nincorporates a self-authenticating mechanism to prevent adversarial\nmanipulation of message exchanges during the protocol. Since the level crossing\nalgorithm is best suited for fading processes that exhibit symmetry in their\nunderlying distribution, we present a second and more powerful approach that is\nsuited for more general channel state distributions. This second approach is\nmotivated by observations from quantizing jointly Gaussian processes, but\nexploits empirical measurements to set quantization boundaries and a heuristic\nlog likelihood ratio estimate to achieve an improved secret key generation\nrate. We validate both proposed protocols through experimentations using a\ncustomized 802.11a platform, and show for the typical WiFi channel that\nreliable secret key establishment can be accomplished at rates on the order of\n10 bits/second.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2009 02:01:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

So far, theoretical explanations for body-size patterns in periodic\npopulation dynamics have received little attention. In particular, tuning and\ntesting of allometric models on empirical data and regressions has not been\ncarried out yet. Here, oscillations expected from a one-species (delayed\nlogistic) and a two-species (Rosenzweig-MacArthur) model were compared to\ncycles observed in laboratory experiments and field surveys for a wide range of\ninvertebrates and vertebrates. The parameters in the equations were linked to\nbody mass, using a consistent set of allometric relationships that was\ncalibrated on 230 regressions. Oscillation period and amplitude predicted by\nthe models were validated with data taken from literature. Results. The\ncollected data showed that cycle times of herbivores scaled to species body\nmass with a slope up to 1/4 as expected from the models. With exception of\naquatic herbi-detritivores, intercepts were observed at the level calculated by\nthe two-species model. Remarkably, oscillation periods were size-independent\nfor predatory invertebrates, fishes, birds and mammals. Average cycles were of\n4 to 5 years, similar to those predicted by the one-species model with a\nsize-independent delay of 1 year. The consistent difference between herbivores\nand the carnivores could be explained by the models from the small parameter\nspace for consumer-resource cycles in generalist predators. As expected,\namplitudes recorded in the field did not scale to size. Observed oscillation\nperiods were generally within a factor of about 2 from the values expected from\nthe models. This demonstrates that a set of slopes and intercepts for age and\ndensity parameters applicable to a wide range of species allows a reasonable\nestimate of independently measured cycle times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2009 08:25:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-24"}

The\nstandard scenario to form planetary commensurabilities is convergent migration\nof two planets embedded in a protoplanetary disc. When the planets are\ninitially separated by a period ratio larger than two, convergent migration\nwill most likely lead to a very stable 2:1 resonance for moderate migration\nrates. To avoid this fate, formation of the planets close enough to prevent\nthis resonance may be proposed. However, such a simultaneous formation of the\nplanets within a small annulus, seems to be very unlikely.\n  Rapid type III migration of the outer planet crossing the 2:1 resonance is\none possible way around this problem. In this paper, we investigate this idea\nin detail. We present an estimate for the required convergent migration rate\nand confirm this with N-body and hydrodynamical simulations. If the dynamical\nhistory of the planetary system had a phase of rapid inward migration that\nforms a resonant configuration, we predict that the orbital parameters of the\ntwo planets are always very similar and hence should show evidence of that.\n  We use the orbital parameters from our simulation to calculate a radial\nvelocity curve and compare it to observations. Our model can explain the\nobservational data as good as the previously reported fit. The eccentricities\nof both planets are considerably smaller and the libration pattern is\ndifferent. Within a few years, it will be possible to observe the planet-planet\ninteraction directly and thus distinguish between these different dynamical\nstates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2009 10:44:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-29"}

Through-going muon tracks have been used\nto determine the free electron lifetime in liquid Argon against\nelectro-negative impurities. The short path length here observed (30 cm) is\ncompensated by the high accuracy in the observation of the specific ionization\nof cosmic ray muons at sea level as a function of the drift distance. A free\nelectron lifetime of (21.4+7.3-4.3) ms, namely > 15.8 ms at 90 % C.L. has been\nobserved over several weeks under stable conditions, corresponding to a\nresidual Oxygen equivalent of about 15 ppt (part per trillion). At 500 V/cm,\nthe free electron speed is 1.5 m/ms. In a LAr-TPC a free electron lifetime in\nexcess of 15 ms corresponds for instance to an attenuation of less than 15 %\nafter a drift path of 5 m, opening the way to the operation of the LAr-TPC with\nexceptionally long drift distances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2009 15:49:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2010 16:21:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

Planet\nformation itself as well as photoevaporation by energetic radiation from the\ncentral young stellar object have been proposed as plausible dispersal\nmechanisms. [abridged]. In this paper we use the different metallicity\ndependance of X-ray photoevaporation and planet formation to discriminate\nbetween these two processes. We study the effects of metallicity, Z, on the\ndispersal timescale, t_phot, in the context of a photoevaporation model, by\nmeans of detailed thermal calculations of a disc in hydrostatic equilibrium\nirradiated by EUV and X-ray radiation from the central source. Our models show\nt_phot \\propto Z^0.52 for a pure photoevaporation model. By means of analytical\nestimates we derive instead a much stronger negative power dependance on\nmetallicity of the disc lifetime for a dispersal model based on planet\nformation. A census of disc fractions in lower metallicity regions should\ntherefore be able to distinguish between the two models. A recent study by\nYasui et al. in low metallicity clusters of the extreme outer Galaxy ([O/H] ~-\n0.7dex and dust to gas ratio of ~0.001) provides preliminary observational\nevidence for shorter disc lifetimes at lower metallicities, in agreement with\nthe predictions of a pure photoevaporation model. [abridged] We finally develop\nan analytical framework to study the effects of metallicity dependent\nphotoevaporation on the formation of gas giants in the core accretion scenario.\nWe show that accounting for this effect strengthens the conclusion that planet\nformation is favoured at higher metallicity.

In\nthis setting, standard CS techniques cannot be applied directly for several\nreasons. First, the usual signal-independent and/or bounded noise models do not\napply to Poisson noise, which is non-additive and signal-dependent. Second, the\nCS matrices typically considered are not feasible in real optical systems\nbecause they do not adhere to important constraints, such as nonnegativity and\nphoton flux preservation. Third, the typical $\\ell_2$--$\\ell_1$ minimization\nleads to overfitting in the high-intensity regions and oversmoothing in the\nlow-intensity areas. In this paper, we describe how a feasible positivity- and\nflux-preserving sensing matrix can be constructed, and then analyze the\nperformance of a CS reconstruction approach for Poisson data that minimizes an\nobjective function consisting of a negative Poisson log likelihood term and a\npenalty term which measures signal sparsity. We show that, as the overall\nintensity of the underlying signal increases, an upper bound on the\nreconstruction error decays at an appropriate rate (depending on the\ncompressibility of the signal), but that for a fixed signal intensity, the\nsignal-dependent part of the error bound actually grows with the number of\nmeasurements or sensors.

Cuckoo hashing is a\ntechnique that extends this concept. There,we are given a table with $n$\nlocations, and we assume that each location can hold one item. Each item to be\ninserted chooses randomly k>1 locations and has to be placed in any one of\nthem. How much load can cuckoo hashing handle before collisions prevent the\nsuccessful assignment of the available items to the chosen locations? Practical\nevaluations of this method have shown that one can allocate a number of\nelements that is a large proportion of the size of the table, being very close\nto 1 even for small values of k such as 4 or 5.\n  In this paper we show that there is a critical value for this proportion:\nwith high probability, when the amount of available items is below this value,\nthen these can be allocated successfully, but when it exceeds this value, the\nallocation becomes impossible.

The notion of a photon anomalous\nmagnetic moment is analyzed and its connection with the quasiparticle character\nof the electromagnetic radiation is established. In the infrared domain the\nmagnetic moment turns out to be a vector with two orthogonal components in\ncorrespondence with the cylindrical symmetry imposed by the external field. The\npossibility of defining such quantity in the high energy limit is studied as\nwell. Its existence suggests that the electromagnetic radiation is a source of\nmagnetization to the whole vacuum and thus its electron-positron zero-point\nenergy is slightly modified. The corresponding contribution to the vacuum\nmagnetization density is determined by considering the individual contribution\nof each vacuum polarization eigenmode in the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian. A\nparamagnetic response is found in one of them, whereas the remaining ones are\ndiamagnetic. Additional issues concerning the transverse pressures are\nanalyzed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2009 15:43:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2009 15:30:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 2010 19:41:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}
