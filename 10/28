The density matrix\nexpansion (DME) of Negele and Vautherin is a convenient method to map highly\nnon-local Hartree-Fock expressions into the form of a quasi-local Skyrme\nfunctional with density-dependent couplings. In this work, we assess the\naccuracy of the DME at reproducing the non-local exchange (Fock) contribution\nto the energy. In contrast to the scalar part of the density matrix for which\nthe original formulation of Negele and Vautherin is reasonably accurate, we\ndemonstrate the necessity to reformulate the DME for the vector part of the\ndensity matrix, which is needed for an accurate description of spin-unsaturated\nnuclei. Phase-space averaging techniques are shown to yield a significant\nimprovement for the vector part of the density matrix compared to the original\nformulation of Negele and Vautherin. The key to the improved accuracy is to\ntake into account the anisotropy that characterizes the local-momentum\ndistribution in the surface region of finite Fermi systems. Optimizing\nseparately the DME for the central, tensor and spin-orbit contributions to the\nFock energy, one reaches a few-percent accuracy over a representative set of\nsemi-magic nuclei. With such an accuracy at hand, one can envision using the\ncorresponding Skyrme-like energy functional as a microscopically-constrained\nstarting point around which future phenomenological parameterizations can be\nbuilt and refined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2009 18:41:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2009 13:47:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2009 06:17:44 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2010 19:13:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

In the first lecture I start from the old\nquestion \"in what sense is gravity a gauge theory?\" I will reformulate the\ntheory of gravity in a general kinematical setting which highlights the\npresence of two Goldstone boson-like fields, and the occurrence of a\ngravitational Higgs phenomenon. The fact that in General Relativity the\nconnection is a derived quantity appears to be a low energy consequence of this\nHiggs phenomenon. From here it is simple to see how to embed the group of local\nframe transformations and a Yang Mills group into a larger unifying group, and\nhow the distinction between these groups, and the corresponding interactions,\nderives from the VEV of an order parameter. I will describe in some detail the\nfermionic sector of a realistic \"GraviGUT\" with SO(3,1)xSO(10) \\subset\nSO(3,11). In the second lecture I will discuss the possibility that the\nrenormalization group flow of gravity has a fixed point with a finite number of\nattractive directions. This would make the theory well behaved in the\nultraviolet, and predictive, in spite of being perturbatively\nnonrenormalizable. There is by now a significant amount of evidence that this\nmay be the case. There are thus reasons to believe that quantum field theory\nmay eventually prove sufficient to explain the mysteries of gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2009 16:35:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

Dynamical ejection by a supermassive black hole is favoured to explain\ntheir origin. Locating the place of birth of an individual HVS is of utmost\nimportance to understanding the ejection mechanism. SDSS J013655.91+242546.0\n(J0136+2425 for short) was found amongst three high-velocity stars (drawn from\na sample of more than 10000 blue stars), for which proper motions were\nmeasured.

We provide\na new interpretation of the observed quiet Sun TR emission in terms of the\nrelentless mass transport between the chromosphere and corona - a mixture of\nemission from dynamic episodic heating and mass injection into the corona as\nwell as that from the previously filled, slowly cooling, coronal plasma.\nAnalysis of the observed upflow component shows that it carries enough hot\nplasma to play a significant role in the energy and mass balance of the quiet\ncorona.

The extremely simple\ndesign of the sample platform, based on a sapphire substrate, and the\nexperimental setup, which makes use only of a lock-in amplifier and a\ntemperature controller, make the construction of such a calorimeter easy and\ninexpensive. The thermal-relaxation method is employed, which utilizes a\npermanent thermal link $k$ between the sample platform and the low-temperature\nbath. The temperature dependence of $k(T)$ is shown for several platforms\nthroughout the entire temperature range: $k(T)/T$ is nearly constant down to 1\nK, where it starts to decrease smoothly. The observed behavior is thoroughly\nexplained by considering the thermal resistances of the platform constituents.\nA comparison between the values of $k(T)/T$ for platforms based on sapphire and\non silver is presented where no significant difference has been observed. Each\nplatform can be assembled to have a particular value of $k/T$ at 1 K. Since the\nsample relaxation time $\\tau \\sim C/k$, $k(T)$ can be adjusted to $C(T)$ to\ngive a reasonably fast measuring time: Here, it is demonstrated how this\ncalorimeter can be used in so-called single-shot refrigerators ($^{3}$He or\ndemagnetization cryostats), where the time for a single measurement is limited.\nIn addition, it can be used in moderate magnetic fields $B \\leq 10$ T, because\nthe platform constituents are weakly field dependent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2009 18:11:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-13"}

In current models of\nstructure formation, it is standard practice to treat baryons and CDM as an\neffective single component fluid. In this approximation, one uses a weighed sum\nof late-time baryon and CDM transfer functions to set initial conditions. Here,\nwe explore whether this approach can be used for high precision work. We show\nthat, even for a pure linear treatment, there is a large-scale scale-dependent\nbias between baryons and CDM for WMAP5 cosmology. This bias is >1% until the\npresent day, when it is driven towards unity through gravitational relaxation.\nUsing the RPT formalism we test this approximation in the non-linear regime,\nand show that the CDM power spectrum in the 2-component fluid differs from that\nobtained from a 1-component fluid by ~3% on scales of order k~0.05 h/Mpc at\nz=10, and by ~0.5% at z=0. However, for the case of baryons the situation is\nworse and we find that the power spectrum is suppressed by ~15% on scales\nk~0.05 h/Mpc at z=10, and by ~3-5% at z=0, relative to the total matter.\nImportantly, besides the suppression of the spectrum, baryonic acoustic\noscillations (BAO) are amplified for baryon and damped for CDM spectra. Thus,\nhigh precision modeling of baryons can not be probed through CDM only\nsimulations; detection significance of BAO will be amplified in probes that\nstudy baryonic matter.

The scattered light intensity\nimage and polarization structure reveal a highly inclined disk with a clear\nasymmetric, swept back component, suggestive of significant interaction with\nthe ambient interstellar medium. The combination of our new data with the\npublished 1.1 micron discovery image shows that the grains are blue scattering\nwith no strong color gradient as a function of radius, implying predominantly\nsub-micron sized grains. We investigate possible explanations that could\naccount for the observed swept back, asymmetric morphology. Previous work has\nsuggested that HD 61005 may be interacting with a cold, unusually dense\ninterstellar cloud. However, limits on the intervening interstellar gas column\ndensity from an optical spectrum of HD 61005 in the Na I D lines render this\npossibility unlikely. Instead, HD 61005 may be embedded in a more typical warm,\nlow-density cloud that introduces secular perturbations to dust grain orbits.\nThis mechanism can significantly distort the ensemble disk structure within a\ntypical cloud crossing time. For a counterintuitive relative flow\ndirection--parallel to the disk midplane--we find that the structures generated\nby these distortions can very roughly approximate the HD 61005 morphology.\nFuture observational studies constraining the direction of the relative\ninterstellar medium flow will thus provide an important constraint for future\nmodeling. Independent of the interpretation for HD 61005, we expect that\ninterstellar gas drag likely plays a role in producing asymmetries observed in\nother debris disk systems, such as HD 15115 and Delta-Velorum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2009 23:31:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

Two observers\ncan make repeated noisy observations of a binary hypothesis on the state of the\nenvironment. At any time, observer 1 can stop and send a final binary message\nto observer 2 or it may continue to take more measurements. Every time observer\n1 postpones its final message to observer 2, it incurs a penalty. Observer 2's\noperation under two different scenarios is explored. In the first scenario,\nobserver 2 waits to receive the final message from observer 1 and then starts\ntaking measurements of its own. It is then faced with a stopping problem on\nwhether to stop and declare a decision on the hypothesis or to continue taking\nmeasurements. In the second scenario, observer 2 starts taking measurements\nfrom the beginning. It is then faced with a different stopping problem. At any\ntime, observer 2 can decide whether to stop and declare a decision on the\nhypothesis or to continue to take more measurements and wait for observer 1 to\nsend its final message. Parametric characterization of optimal policies for the\ntwo observers are obtained under both scenarios. A sequential methodology for\nfinding the optimal policies is presented. The parametric characterizations are\nthen extended to problem with increased communication alphabet for the final\nmessage from observer 1 to observer 2; and to the case of multiple peripheral\nsensors that each send a single final message to a coordinating sensor who\nmakes the final decision on the hypothesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2009 23:07:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-29"}

Several formation scenarios have\nbeen proposed, where most combine the canonical oligarchic picture of core\naccretion with type I migration (e.g. Terquem & Papaloizou 2007) and planetary\natmosphere physics (e.g. Alibert et al. 2006). To date, published studies have\nconsidered only a small number of progenitors at late times. This leaves\nunaddressed important questions about the global viability of the models. We\nseek to determine whether the most natural model -- namely, taking the\ncanonical oligarchic picture of core accretion and introducing type I migration\n-- can succeed in forming objects of 10 Earth masses and more in the innermost\nparts of the disc. This problem is investigated using both traditional\nsemianalytic methods for modelling oligarchic growth as well as a new parallel\nmulti-zone N-body code designed specifically for treating planetary formation\nproblems with large dynamic range (McNeil & Nelson 2009). We find that it is\nextremely difficult for oligarchic tidal migration models to reproduce the\nobserved distribution. Even under many variations of the typical parameters, we\nform no objects of mass greater than 8 Earth masses. By comparison, it is\nrelatively straightforward to form icy super-Earths. We conclude that either\nthe initial conditions of the protoplanetary discs in short-period Neptune\nsystems were substantially different from the standard disc models we used, or\nthere is important physics yet to be understood.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2009 07:35:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

It is well known that massive black holes in active\ngalaxies can release a substantial fraction of their accretion power into\nenergetic particles, producing gamma-rays and relativistic jets. Galactic\nmicroquasars (hosting a compact star of 1-10 solar masses which accretes matter\nfrom a binary companion) also produce relativistic jets. However, no direct\nevidence of particle acceleration above GeV energies has ever been obtained in\nmicroquasar ejections, leaving open the issue of the occurrence and timing of\nextreme matter energization during jet formation. Here we report the detection\nof transient gamma-ray emission above 100 MeV from the microquasar Cygnus X-3,\nan exceptional X-ray binary which sporadically produces powerful radio jets.\nFour gamma-ray flares (each lasting 1-2 days) were detected by the AGILE\nsatellite simultaneously with special spectral states of Cygnus X-3 during the\nperiod mid-2007/mid-2009. Our observations show that very efficient particle\nacceleration and gamma-ray propagation out of the inner disk of a microquasar\nusually occur a few days before major relativistic jet ejections. Flaring\nparticle energies can be thousands of times larger than previously detected\nmaximum values (with Lorentz factors of 105 and 102 for electrons and protons,\nrespectively). We show that the transitional nature of gamma-ray flares and\nparticle acceleration above GeV energies in Cygnus X-3 is clearly linked to\nspecial radio/X-ray states preceding strong radio flares. Thus gamma-rays\nprovide unique insight into the nature of physical processes in microquasars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2009 11:13:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2009 13:49:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

We used these best-fit slopes\nto estimate the mean spectral slope for each object, while we used results from\nthe literature to estimate the average spectral slope of the three objects\nwithout archival, monitorin RXTE data. Our results show that the AGN average\nspectral slopes are not correlated either with the black hole mass or the\ncharacteristic frequencies that were detected in the power spectra.They are\npositively correlated, though, with the characteristic frequency when\nnormalised to the sources black hole mass. This is similar to the\nspectral-timing correlation that has been observed in Cyg X-1, but not the\nsame.The AGN spectral-timing correlation can be explained if we assume that the\naccretion rate determines both the average spectral slope and the\ncharacteristic time scales in AGN. The spectrum should steepen and the\ncharacteristic frequency should increase, proportionally, with increasing\naccretion rate. We also provide a quantitative expression between spectral\nslope and accretion rate. Thermal Comptonisation models are broadly consistent\nwith our result, but only if the ratio of the soft photons' luminosity to the\npower injected to the hot corona is proportionally related to the accretion\nrate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2009 15:31:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-02"}

Because of the spatial\nseparation of the entangled electronic system over two quantum dots, a\nsuccessful verification of entangled photons emitted by this system would imply\nthe detection of nonlocal spin-entanglement of massive particles in a solid\nstate structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2009 14:26:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-24"}

The proposed tissue algorithm is based on\nself-organizing networks, such as self-organizing maps (SOM) developed by\nKohonen (1996) and an analogy of the so called Toll-Like Receptors (TLR)\naffecting the activation function of the clusters developed by the SOM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2009 15:36:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-05"}

As an\napplication, we give new proofs of two theorems of Handel-Mosher, that the\nLipschitz metric is quasi-symmetric when restricted to a thick part of Outer\nspace, and that there is a uniform bound, depending only on the rank, on the\nratio of logs of growth rates of any irreducible outer automorphism f in\nOut(F_n) and its inverse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2009 15:47:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Jun 2010 21:15:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2011 21:05:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-25"}
