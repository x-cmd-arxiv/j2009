Well-sampled, high-precision\noptical (ugriBV) and near-infrared (NIR; YJHKs) light curves obtained in a\nwell-understood photometric system are used to provide light-curve parameters,\nand ugriBVYJH template light curves. The intrinsic colors at maximum light are\ncalibrated to compute optical--NIR color excesses for the full sample, thus\nallowing the properties of the reddening law in the host galaxies to be\nstudied. A low value of Rv~1.7, is derived when using the entire sample of SNe.\nHowever, when the two highly reddened SNe in the sample are excluded, a value\nGalactic standard of Rv~3.2 is obtained. The colors of these two events are\nwell matched by a reddening model due to circumstellar dust. The peak\nluminosities are calibrated using a two-parameter linear fit to the decline\nrates and the colors, or alternatively, the color excesses. In both cases,\ndispersions in absolute magnitude of 0.12--0.16 mag are obtained, depending on\nthe filter-color combination. In contrast to the results obtained from color\nexcesses, these fits give Rv~1--2, even when the two highly reddened SNe are\nexcluded. This discrepancy suggests that, beyond the \"normal\" interstellar\nreddening produced in the host galaxies, there is an intrinsic dispersion in\nthe colors of SNe Ia which is correlated with luminosity but independent of the\ndecline rate. Finally, a Hubble diagram is produced by combining the results of\nthe fits for each filter. The resulting scatter of 0.12 mag appears to be\nlimited by peculiar velocities as evidenced by the strong correlation between\nthe distance-modulus residuals among the different filters. The implication is\nthat the actual precision of SN Ia distances is 3--4%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Oct 2009 17:22:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-07"}

A suitably\ncovariant infinite-component localization is displayed, reflecting Bergmann's\nrealization that there are infinitely many conserved gravitational\nenergy-momenta. Initially use is made of a flat background metric or connection\n(or rather, all of them), because the desired gauge invariance properties are\nobvious. Partial gauge-fixing then yields an appropriate covariant quantity\nwithout any background metric or connection; one version is the collection of\npseudotensors of a given type, such as the Einstein pseudotensor, in_every_\ncoordinate system. This solution to the gauge covariance problem is easily\nadapted to any pseudotensorial expression or to any tensorial expression built\nwith a background metric or connection. Thus the specific functional form can\nbe chosen on technical grounds such as relating to Noether's theorem and\nyielding expected values of conserved quantities in certain contexts and then\nrendered covariant using the procedure described here. The application to\nangular momentum localization is straightforward. Traditional objections to\npseudotensors are based largely on the false assumption that there is only one\ngravitational energy rather than infinitely many.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Oct 2009 19:07:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-20"}

From an observational standpoint, many of these systems\npresent technical difficulties for precise radial-velocity measurements and\nclassical Doppler surveys avoid them accordingly. In spite of these adverse\nfactors, present data support the idea that giant planets residing in binary\nand hierarchical systems provide unique observational constraints on the\nprocesses of planet formation and evolution. The interest and the importance of\nincluding various types of binary stars in extrasolar planet studies have thus\ngrown over time and significant efforts have recently been put into: (i)\nsearching for stellar companions to the known planet-host stars using direct\nimaging, and (ii) extending Doppler planet searches to spectroscopic and\nmoderately close visual binaries. In this contribution we review the\nobservational progresses made over the past years to detect and study\nextrasolar planets in binary systems, putting special emphasis on the two\ndevelopments mentioned above.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Oct 2009 20:09:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Lately, it was found that many of these networks\ndisplay some common topological features, such as high clustering, small\naverage path length (small world networks) and a power-law degree distribution\n(scale free networks). The topological features of a network are commonly\nrelated to the network's functionality. However, the topology alone does not\naccount for the nature of the interactions in the network and their strength.\nHere we introduce a method for evaluating the correlations between pairs of\nnodes in the network. These correlations depend both on the topology and on the\nfunctionality of the network. A network with high connectivity displays strong\ncorrelations between its interacting nodes and thus features small-world\nfunctionality. We quantify the correlations between all pairs of nodes in the\nnetwork, and express them as matrix elements in the correlation matrix. From\nthis information one can plot the correlation function for the network and to\nextract the correlation length. The connectivity of a network is then defined\nas the ratio between this correlation length and the average path length of the\nnetwork. Using this method we distinguish between a topological small world and\na functional small world, where the latter is characterized by long range\ncorrelations and high connectivity. Clearly, networks which share the same\ntopology, may have different connectivities, based on the nature and strength\nof their interactions. The method is demonstrated on metabolic networks, but\ncan be readily generalized to other types of networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Oct 2009 12:19:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-20"}

In this\npaper, we review the proposals for the semantics of these crucial operators.\nFor each of these proposals, we concentrate on the three following problems:\nthe definition of the semantics of the operator, the language needed to express\nthe operator, and the algorithmic issues associated to the problem of computing\nthe operator. It should be pointed out that we primarily consider the\nformalization of schema mappings introduced in the work on data exchange. In\nparticular, when studying the problem of computing the composition and inverse\nof a schema mapping, we will be mostly interested in computing these operators\nfor mappings specified by source-to-target tuple-generating dependencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Oct 2009 13:46:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2009 17:48:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2009 18:22:06 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 2010 18:36:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-04"}

The new paradigm and the simple revised measure uncover the\ntrue complex degree mixing patterns of complex networks with superrich nodes.\nThe new method indicates that some networks show a false disassortative mixing\ninduced by superrich nodes, and have no tendency to be genuinely\ndisassortative.

This substratum represents an\ninertial solution to the nonlinear equations of a geometric unified theory and\nprovides a limit solution to general solutions in the theory. When a solution\napproaches the substratum solution as a limit we physically obtain a newtonian\nlimit of the gravitational sector of the unified theory. The curvature scalar\nis determined by the interaction mass-energy content of the solution. In the\nlimit the equation reduces to Poisson equation and the curvature scalar reduces\nto the constant substratum curvature scalar which determines Newton\ngravitational constant G. Outside the limit the curvature parameter replaces\nthe newtonian constant G as the coupling parameter of Einstein equation of\ngravitation. This new parameter may be approximately constant in certain\nphysical conditions but, in general should be considered a variable which\ndepends on the matter and energy on space-time. This effect and the geometric\nstructure of matter and fields may be interpreted as dark matter effects. The\nsubstratum also determines a constant mass parameter for field excitations\nwhich obey the Dirac equation and behave as particles. Physically we consider\nthat the substratum provides two related mass scales: the gravitational\nconstant G characterizes a macroscopic mass scale and a fundamental particle\nmass m characterizes a microscopic mass scale. The substratum geometrically\nrepresents the physical concept of inertial system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Oct 2009 14:50:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-20"}
