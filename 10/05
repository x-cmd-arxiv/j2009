However, it is\nknown that at high densities the `t Hooft large N_c world looks very different\nfrom the N_c=3 world, which is believed to be in a color superconducting phase\nat high densities. At large N_c, on the other hand, the DGR instability causes\na chiral-density wave phase to dominate over the color superconducting phase.\nThere is an alternative large N_c limit, with the quarks transforming in the\ntwo-index antisymmetric representation of the gauge group, which at N_c=3\nreduces to QCD but looks quite different at large N_c. We show that in this\nalternative large N_c limit, the DGR instability does not occur, so that it may\nbe plausible that the ground state of high-density quark matter is a color\nsuperconductor even when N_c is large. This revives the hope that a large N_c\napproximation might be useful for getting some insights into the high-density\nphenomenology of QCD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Oct 2009 17:50:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

The evaporation of sessile\ndrop is more complicated than it appears due to the coupling by conduction with\nthe heating substrate, the convection and conduction inside the drop and the\nconvection and diffusion with the vapour phase.

Starting from the\nbound-state Hamiltonian equation of motion in QCD, we derive relativistic\nlight-front wave equations in terms of an invariant impact variable zeta which\nmeasures the separation of the quark and gluonic constituents within the hadron\nat equal light-front time. These equations of motion in physical space-time are\nequivalent to the equations of motion which describe the propagation of spin-J\nmodes in anti--de Sitter (AdS) space. Its eigenvalues give the hadronic\nspectrum, and its eigenmodes represent the probability distribution of the\nhadronic constituents at a given scale. Applications to the light meson and\nbaryon spectra are presented. The predicted meson spectrum has a string-theory\nRegge form M^2 = 4 kappa^2(n+L+S/2); i.e., the square of the eigenmass is\nlinear in both L and n, where n counts the number of nodes of the wavefunction\nin the radial variable zeta.

The Gowers norm is based on a natural 2^{d+1}-query test for\nthis property. Alon et al. [AKKLR05] rediscovered this test and showed that it\naccepts every degree d polynomial with probability 1, while it rejects\nfunctions that are Omega(1)-far with probability Omega(1/(d 2^{d})). We give an\nasymptotically optimal analysis of this test, and show that it rejects\nfunctions that are (even only) Omega(2^{-d})-far with Omega(1)-probability (so\nthe rejection probability is a universal constant independent of d and n). This\nimplies a tight relationship between the (d+1)st Gowers norm of a function and\nits maximal correlation with degree d polynomials, when the correlation is\nclose to 1. Our proof works by induction on n and yields a new analysis of even\nthe classical Blum-Luby-Rubinfeld [BLR93] linearity test, for the setting of\nfunctions mapping F_2^n to F_2. The optimality follows from a tighter analysis\nof counterexamples to the \"inverse conjecture for the Gowers norm\" constructed\nby [GT09,LMS08]. Our result has several implications. First, it shows that the\nGowers norm test is tolerant, in that it also accepts close codewords. Second,\nit improves the parameters of an XOR lemma for polynomials given by Viola and\nWigderson [VW07]. Third, it implies a \"query hierarchy\" result for property\ntesting of affine-invariant properties. That is, for every function q(n), it\ngives an affine-invariant property that is testable with O(q(n))-queries, but\nnot with o(q(n))-queries, complementing an analogous result of [GKNR09] for\ngraph properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Oct 2009 21:17:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Apr 2010 05:06:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-12"}

The fact that both patterns emerge\nwithin the framework of the Ginzburg-Landau description of superconductivity\nindicates that the formation of regular structures may be a generic feature of\nany phase transition.

In this paper,\nwe have proposed a general model which explains the noise induced resonance\nphenomenon CCR as well as coherence resonance (CR) and stochastic resonance\n(SR). The simulation has been carried out considering the basic mechanism of\nnoise induced resonance phenomena: noise only perturbs the system control\nparameter to excite coherent oscillations, taking proper precautions so that\nthe destructive effect of noise does not affect the system. In this approach,\nthe CR has been obtained from the interference between the system output and\nnoise, and the SR has been obtained by adding noise and a subthreshold signal.\nThis also explains the observation of the frequency shift of coherent\noscillations in the CCR with noise level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2009 06:53:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2009 16:42:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-17"}

In this paper we show that the main\nobserved properties of this HE emission are those predicted by the cannonball\n(CB) model of GRBs: In the CB model all the observed radiations in a GRB are\nproduced by the interaction of a highly relativistic jet of plasmoids (CBs)\nwith the environment. The prompt X-ray and MeV $\\gamma$-ray pulses are produced\nby inverse Compton scattering (ICS) of glory photons -photons scattered/emitted\ninto a cavity created by the wind/ejecta blown from the progenitor star or a\ncompanion star long before the GRB- by the thermal electrons in the CBs. A\nsimultaneous optical and high energy emission begins shortly after each MeV\npulse when the CB collides with the wind/ejecta, and continues during the\ndeceleration of the CB in the interstellar medium. The optical emission is\ndominated by synchrotron radiation (SR) from the swept-in and knocked-on\nelectrons which are Fermi accelerated to high energies by the turbulent\nmagnetic fields in the CBs, while ICS of these SR photons dominates the\nemission of HE photons.

These emission lines are fitted with composite models of broad and\nnarrow emission, which include combinations of classical broad-line regions of\nfast-moving gas clouds lying outside the quasar nucleus, and/or a theoretical\nmodel of emission from an optically-thick, flattened, rotating accretion disk.\nAll bar one of the nineteen sources are found to have emission consistent with\nthe presence of an optically-emitting accretion disk, with the exception\nappearing to display complex emission including at least three broad\ncomponents. Ten of the quasars have strong Bayesian evidence for broad-line\nemission arising from an accretion disk together with a standard broad-line\nregion, selected in preference to a model with two simple broad lines. Thus the\nbest explanation for the complexity required to fit the broad H-alpha lines in\nthis sample is optical emission from an accretion disk in addition to a region\nof fast-moving clouds.

Together with\npreviously published data, our results allow us to propose a new linear phase\nboundary in the pressure-temperature phase diagram. The data are analyzed in\nthe framework of the Landau theory of phase transitions. With a revised value\nof the coupling coefficient between the order parameter and the volume\nspontaneous strain, the model built from pressure-independent coefficients\nreproduces satisfactorily the boundary in the phase diagram, but fails at\nreflecting the more pronounced second-order character of the pressure-induced\nphase transition as compared to the temperature-induced transition. We propose\na new Landau potential suitable for the description of the pressure-induced\nphase transition. Finally, we show that particular attention has to be paid to\nhydrostatic conditions in the study of the high-pressure phase transition in\nSTO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2009 10:08:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2009 13:38:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2010 18:06:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-03"}

If in\naddition the field has a non-zero rest mass then the mass term effectively\nworks as a mirror, reflecting the scattered wave back towards the black hole.\nIn this physical system, known as a black-hole bomb, the wave may bounce back\nand forth between the black hole and some turning point amplifying itself each\ntime. Consequently, the massive field grows exponentially over time and is\nunstable. Former analytical estimations of the timescale associated with the\ninstability were restricted to the regimes $M\\mu>>1$ and $M\\mu<<1$, where $M$\nand $\\mu$ are the masses of the black hole and the field, respectively. In\nthese two limits the growth rate of the field was found to be extremely weak.\nHowever, subsequent numerical investigations have indicated that the\ninstability is actually greatest in the regime $M\\mu=O(1)$, where the previous\nanalytical approximations break down. Thus, a new analytical study of the\ninstability timescale for the case $M\\mu=O(1)$ is physically well motivated. In\nthis Letter we study analytically for the first time the phenomena of\nsuperradiant instability (the black-hole bomb mechanism) in this physically\ninteresting regime -- the regime of greatest instability. We find an\ninstability growth rate of $\\tau^{-1}=\\omega_I=1.7\\times 10^{-3}M^{-1}$ for the\nfastest growing mode. This instability is four orders of magnitude stronger\nthan has been previously estimated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2009 12:12:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-07"}

A defining\ncharacteristic of the proposed framework is that it is based on two separate\nbut closely intertwined logics: a specification logic that facilitates the\ndescription of computational structure and another logic that exploits the\nspecial characteristics of the specification logic to support reasoning about\nthe computational behavior of systems that are described using it.

We first\nvalidate our approach by calculating the vertical ionization energies of the\nbenzene molecule and then show its potential by addressing the spectrum of a\nlarge molecule such as free-base tetraphenylporphyrin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2009 15:42:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

In our approach a\nseries expansion is constructed in vertices of the corresponding atomic\nHamiltonian problem. This expansion contains a small parameter in two limiting\ncases: in the weak coupling case ($U/t \\to 0$), due to the smallness of the\nirreducible vertices, and near the atomic limit ($U/t \\to \\infty$), when bare\npropagators are small. Reasonable results are obtained also for the most\ninteresting case of strong correlations ($U \\approx t$). The atomic problem of\nthe Anderson impurity model has a degenerate ground state, so the application\nof the perturbation theory is not straightforward. We construct a special\napproach dealing with symmetry-broken ground state of the renormalized atomic\nproblem. Formulae for the first-order dual diagram correction are obtained\nanalytically in the real-time domain. Most of the Kondo-physics is reproduced:\nlogarithmic contributions to the self energy arise, Kondo-like peak at the\nFermi level appears, and the Friedel sum rule is fulfilled. Our approach\ndescribes also renormalization of atomic resonances due to hybridization with a\nconduction band. A generalization of the proposed scheme to a multi-orbital\ncase can be important for the realistic description of correlated solids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2009 15:47:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-15"}
