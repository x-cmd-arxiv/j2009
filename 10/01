However, in any experimental implementation the average fidelity\nbetween the target and output states cannot be perfect. In order for an RSP\nexperiment to demonstrate genuine quantum advantages, it must surpass the\noptimal threshold of a comparable classical protocol.

The galaxy overdensity\nfield is reconstructed using the current sample of ~8500 accurate zCOSMOS\nredshifts at I(AB)<22.5 out to z~1 on scales R from 8 to 12 Mpc/h. By comparing\nthe probability distribution function (PDF) of galaxy density contrast delta_g\nto the lognormal approximation of the PDF of the mass density contrast delta,\nwe obtain the mean biasing function b(delta,z,R) between the galaxy and matter\noverdensity field and its second moments b(hat) and b(tilde) up to z~1. Over\nthe redshift interval 0.4<z<1 the conditional mean function <delta_g|delta> =\nb(delta,z,R) delta is of the following characteristic shape. The function\nvanishes in the most underdense regions and then sharply rises in a nonlinear\nway towards the mean densities. <delta_g|delta> is almost a linear tracer of\nthe matter in the overdense regions, up to the most overdense regions in which\nit is nonlinear again and the local effective slope of <delta_g|delta> vs.\ndelta is smaller than unity. The <delta_g|delta> function is evolving only\nslightly over the redshift interval 0.4<z<1. The linear biasing parameter\nincreases from b(hat)=1.24+/-0.11 at z=0.4 to b(hat)=1.64+/-0.15 at z=1 for the\nM_B<-20-z sample of galaxies. b(hat) does not show any dependence on the\nsmoothing scale from 8 to 12 Mpc/h, but increases with luminosity. The measured\nnonlinearity parameter b(tilde)/b(hat) is of the order of a few percent (but it\ncan be consistent with 0) and it does not change with redshift, the smoothing\nscale or the luminosity. By matching the linear bias of galaxies to the halo\nbias, we infer that the M_B<-20-z galaxies reside in dark matter haloes with a\ncharacteristic mass of about 3-6 x 10^12 Msol, depending on the halo bias fit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2009 14:23:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-04"}

While the additional term of IC\nlosses off of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is negligible in the local\nUniverse, the rapid increase in the strength of the CMB energy density (i.e.\n$\\sim(1+z)^{4})$ suggests that evolution in the FIR-radio correlation should\noccur with infrared (IR; $8-1000 \\micron$)/radio ratios increasing with\nredshift.

A promising possibility, in the\ncase of the coalescence of a super-massive black hole binary (SMBHB), is that\nprompt emission from merger-induced disturbances in a supersonic circumbinary\ndisk may be detectable. We follow the post-merger evolution of a thin,\nzero-viscosity circumbinary gas disk with two-dimensional simulations, using\nthe hydrodynamic code FLASH.

The morphology and evolution of\nthe perturbations agrees well with those of caustics predicted to occur in a\ncollisionless disk. Assuming that the disk radiates nearly instantaneously to\nmaintain a constant temperature, we estimate the amount of dissipation and\ncorresponding post-merger light-curve.

We find explicitly this family\nof solutions and represent them in the phase diagram. We discuss the\nimplications of our results for the gravitational system. Rotating\nnon-axisymmetric black holes necessarily radiate gravitational waves. We thus\nemphasize that it would be important, albeit possibly out of present reach, to\nhave a better understanding of the hydrodynamic description of gravitational\nwaves and of the gravitational interaction between two bodies. We also argue\nthat it might well be that a non-axisymmetric m-lobed instability is also\npresent in Myers-Perry black holes for rotations below the recently found\nultraspinning instability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2009 20:23:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2010 15:05:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-22"}

Our study reveals a dramatic, close-up view of the\nstripping and potential destruction of a cool core within a rich cluster. The\nX-ray emission from the Ophiuchus Cluster core exhibits a comet-like morphology\nextending to the north, driven by merging activity, indicative of ram-pressure\nstripping caused by rapid motion through the ambient cluster gas. A cold front\nat the southern edge implies a velocity of 1000$\\pm$200 km/s (M~0.6). The X-ray\nemission from the cluster core is sharply peaked. As previously noted, the peak\nis offset by 4 arcsec (~2 kpc) from the optical center of the associated cD\ngalaxy, indicating that ram pressure has slowed the core, allowing the\nrelatively collisionless stars and dark matter to carry on ahead. The cluster\nexhibits the strongest central temperature gradient of any massive cluster\nobserved to date: the temperature rises from 0.7 keV within 1 kpc of the\nbrightness peak, to 10 keV by 30 kpc.

A subsurface ocean frictionally decouples the shell\nfrom the interior. This has led to proposals that a weak tidal or atmospheric\ntorque might cause the shell to rotate differentially with respect to the\nsynchronously rotating interior. As a result of centrifugal and tidal forces,\nthe ocean would assume an ellipsoidal shape with its long axis aligned toward\nthe parent planet. Any displacement of the shell away from its equilibrium\nposition would induce strains thereby increasing its elastic energy and giving\nrise to an elastic restoring torque. We compare the elastic torque with the\ntidal torque acting on Europa and the atmospheric torque acting on Titan. For\nEuropa, the tidal torque is far too weak to produce stresses that could\nfracture the ice shell, thus refuting a widely advocated idea. Instead, we\nsuggest that cracks arise from time-dependent stresses due to non-hydrostatic\ngravity anomalies from tidally driven, episodic convection in the interior. Two\nyears of Cassini RADAR observations of Titan's surface are interpreted as\nimplying an angular displacement of ~0.24 degrees relative to synchroneity.\nCompatibility of the amplitude and phase of the observed non-synchronous\nrotation with estimates of the atmospheric torque requires that Titan's shell\nbe decoupled from its interior. We find that the elastic torque balances the\natmospheric torque at an angular displacement <0.05 degrees, thus coupling the\nshell to the interior. Moreover, if Titan's surface were spinning faster than\nsynchronous, the tidal torque tending to restore synchronous rotation would\ncertainly be larger than the atmospheric torque. There must either be a problem\nwith the interpretation of the radar observations, or with our understanding of\nTitan's atmosphere and/or interior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2009 20:58:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Apr 2010 06:47:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 7 May 2010 17:17:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-10"}

Existing historical databases\non the subject are not fully reliable, but a more fundamental hindrance is the\nlack of basic understanding regarding the intrinsic nature of tropical cyclone\ngenesis and evolution. It is known that tropical cyclones involve more than a\npassive response to changing external forcing, but it is not clear which\ndynamic behaviour best describes them. Here we present a new approach based on\nthe application of the power dissipation index (PDI), which constitutes an\nestimation of released energy, to individual tropical cyclones. A robust law\nemerges for the statistics of PDI, valid in four different ocean basins and\nover long time periods. In addition to suggesting a novel description of the\nphysics of tropical cyclones in terms of critical phenomena, the law allows to\nquantify their response to changing climatic conditions, with an increase in\nthe largest PDI values with sea surface temperature or the presence of El Nino\nphenomenon, depending on the basin under consideration.

In\nthis work we explore the possibility that the large variations in the observed\n[Ne II] luminosity may be caused instead by different star-disk parameters. In\nparticular we study the effects that the hardness of the irradiating source and\nthe structure (flaring) of the disk have on the luminosity and spectral profile\nof the [Ne II] 12.8 micron line. We find that varying these parameter can\nindeed cause up to an order of magnitude variation in the emission luminosities\nwhich may explain the scatter observed, although our models predict somewhat\nsmaller luminosities than those recently reported by other authors who observed\nthe line with the Spitzer Space Telescope. Our models also show that the\nhardness of the spectrum has only a limited (undetectable) effect on the line\nprofiles, while changes in the flaring power of the disk significantly affect\nthe size of the [Ne II] emission region and, as a consequence, its line\nprofile.

In all known SNe, this radiation comes from internal energy deposited\nin the outflowing ejecta by either radioactive decay of freshly-synthesized\nelements (typically 56Ni), stored heat deposited by the explosion shock in the\nenvelope of a supergiant star, or interaction between the SN debris and\nslowly-moving, hydrogen-rich circumstellar material. Here we report on a new\nclass of luminous SNe whose observed properties cannot be explained by any of\nthese known processes. These include four new SNe we have discovered, and two\npreviously unexplained events (SN 2005ap; SCP 06F6) that we can now identify as\nmembers. These SNe are all ~10 times brighter than SNe Ia, do not show any\ntrace of hydrogen, emit significant ultra-violet (UV) flux for extended periods\nof time, and have late-time decay rates which are inconsistent with\nradioactivity. Our data require that the observed radiation is emitted by\nhydrogen-free material distributed over a large radius (~10^15 cm) and\nexpanding at high velocities (>10^4 km s^-1). These long-lived, UV-luminous\nevents can be observed out to redshifts z>4 and offer an excellent opportunity\nto study star formation in, and the interstellar medium of, primitive distant\ngalaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2009 03:33:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2011 00:33:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-08"}

In general it\nconsists of two parts, one independent of and another one proportional to the\nmean magnetic field. The first part may be nonzero only in the presence of mhd\nturbulence, maintained, e.g., by small-scale dynamo action. It corresponds to a\nbattery, which lets a mean magnetic field grow from zero to a finite value. The\nsecond part, which covers, e.g., the alpha effect, is important for large-scale\ndynamos. Only a few examples of the aforementioned first part of mean\nelectromotive force have been discussed so far. It is shown that a mean\nelectromotive force proportional to the mean fluid velocity, but independent of\nthe mean magnetic field, may occur in an originally homogeneous isotropic mhd\nturbulence if there are nonzero correlations of velocity and electric current\nfluctuations or, what is equivalent, of vorticity and magnetic field\nfluctuations. This goes beyond the Yoshizawa effect, which consists in the\noccurrence of mean electromotive forces proportional to the mean vorticity or\nto the angular velocity defining the Coriolis force in a rotating frame and\ndepends on the cross-helicity defined by the velocity and magnetic field\nfluctuations. Contributions to the mean electromotive force due to\ninhomogeneity of the turbulence are also considered.

While these methods do not guarantee precise results, they can be vastly\nmore efficient than approaches that rely on exact counting. However, for many\nsimilarity measures no such methods have been known. In this paper we show how\na wide variety of measures can be supported by a simple biased sampling method.\nThe method also extends to find high-confidence association rules. We\ndemonstrate theoretically that our method is superior to exact methods when the\nthreshold for \"interesting similarity/confidence\" is above the average pairwise\nsimilarity/confidence, and the average support is not too low. Our method is\nparticularly good when transactions contain many items. We confirm in\nexperiments on standard association mining benchmarks that this gives a\nsignificant speedup on real data sets (sometimes much larger than the\ntheoretical guarantees).

By\na result of F. Brown, the cell-zeta algebra is equal to the algebra of\nmultizeta values. The cell-zeta values satisfy a family of simple quadratic\nrelations coming from the geometry of moduli spaces, which leads to a natural\ndefinition of a formal version of the cell-zeta algebra, conjecturally\nisomorphic to the formal multizeta algebra defined by the much-studied double\nshuffle relations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2009 09:50:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

The latter can be\nconsidered either \\textit{deterministic} or \\textit{stochastic,} respectively\nfor \\textit{regular} or \\textit{turbulent flows.} In this work we claim that a\npossible statistical formulation of this type can be achieved by means of the\n1-point (local) velocity-space probability density function (PDF, $f_{1}$) to\nbe determined in the framework of the so-called inverse kinetic theory (IKT).\nThere are several important consequences of the theory. These include, in\nparticular, the characterization of the initial PDF [for the statistical model\n${f_{1},\\Gamma} ]$ . This is found to be generally non-Gaussian PDF, even in\nthe case of flows which are regular at the initial time. Moreover, both for\nregular and turbulent flows, its time evolution is provided by a Liouville\nequation, while the corresponding Liouville operator is found to depend only on\na finite number of velocity moments of the same PDF. Hence, its time evolution\ndepends (functionally) solely on the same PDF. In addition, the statistical\nmodel here developed determines uniquely both the initial condition and the\ntime evolution of $f_{1}.$ As a basic implication, the theory allows the\n\\textit{exact construction of the corresponding statistical equation for the\nstochastic-averaged PDF}and the \\textit{unique representation of the\nmulti-point PDF}'s in solely in terms of the 1-point PDF. As an example, the\ncase of the reduced 2-point PDF's, usually adopted for the statistical\ndescription of NS turbulence, is considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2009 09:48:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2009 20:54:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-02"}

We also obtain the exact (when w = - 1/3) and the approximate (when\nw neq -1/3) solutions for the ratio of the overdensity radius to its value at\nthe turnaround epoch (y) for general cosmological parameters. Also the exact\nand approximate solutions of the overdensity at the turnaround epoch (zeta) are\nobtained for general w. Thus, we are able to obtain the non-linear overdensity\nDelta = 1 + delta at any epoch for the given DE model. The non-linear\noverdensity at the virial epoch (Delta_{vir}) is obtained by using the virial\ntheorem and the energy conservation. The non-linear overdensity of every DE\nmodel converges to that of the Einstein de Sitter universe ~ 147 when\nz_{vir}increases. We find that the observed quantities at high redshifts are\ninsensitive to the different w models.

Relaxation is facilitated by electron-boson interaction and\nis accompanied by emission of nonequilibrium bosons. Here I solve numerically a\nfull set of nonlinear kinetic balance equations for stacked Josephson\njunctions, which allows analysis of strongly nonequilibrium phenomena. It is\nshown that nonlinearity becomes significant already at very small\ndisequilibrium. The following new, essentially nonlinear effects are obtained:\n(i) At even-gap voltages $V=2n \\Delta/e$ $(n=2,3,...)$ nonequilibrium bosonic\nbands overlap. This leads to enhanced emission of $\\Omega = 2 \\Delta$ bosons\nand to appearance of dips in tunnel conductance. (ii) A new type of radiative\nsolution is found at strong disequilibrium. It is characterized by the fast\nstimulated relaxation of nonequilibrium quasiparticles. A stack in this state\nbehaves as a light emitting diode and directly converts electric power to boson\nemission, without utilization of the ac-Josephson effect. This leads to very\nhigh radiation efficacy and to significant radiative cooling of the stack. The\nphenomenon can be used for realization of a new type of superconducting cascade\nlaser in the THz frequency range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2009 12:48:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-27"}

Second, we show that\nthe modularity function Q exhibits extreme degeneracies: it typically admits an\nexponential number of distinct high-scoring solutions and typically lacks a\nclear global maximum. Third, we derive the limiting behavior of the maximum\nmodularity Q_max for one model of infinitely modular networks, showing that it\ndepends strongly both on the size of the network and on the number of modules\nit contains. Finally, using three real-world metabolic networks as examples, we\nshow that the degenerate solutions can fundamentally disagree on many, but not\nall, partition properties such as the composition of the largest modules and\nthe distribution of module sizes.

A peculiarity of the system is a small\npositive or negative value of the relative group-velocity dispersion (GVD)\ncoefficient in one equation, assuming that the dispersion is anomalous in the\nother. In contrast to earlier studied systems of nonlinearly coupled NLS\nequations with equal GVD coefficients, which generate only simple single-peak\nsolitons, the present model gives rise to families of solitons with complex\nshapes, which feature extended oscillatory tails and/or a double-peak structure\nat the center.

While experimental measurements of 1DEGs reveal the\nconductance through a system, they do not probe critical other aspects of the\nunderlying physics, including energy eigenstate distribution, magnetic field\neffects, and band structure. These are better accessed by theoretical modeling,\nespecially modeling of the energy and wavefunction distribution across a\nsystem: the local density of states (DOS). In this thesis, a numerical Greens\nfunction model of the local DOS in a 1DEG has been developed and implemented.\nThe model uses an iterative method in a discrete lattice to calculate Greens\nfunctions by vertical slice across a 1DEG. The numerical model is adaptable to\narbitrary surface gate geometry and arbitrary finite magnetic field conditions.\nWhen compared with exact analytical results for the local DOS, waveband\nstructure, and real band structure, the model returned very accurate results. A\nsecond numerical model was also developed that measured the transmission and\nreflection coefficients through the quantum system based on the\nLandauer-Buttiker formalism. The combination of the local DOS model with the\ntransmission coefficients model was applied to two current research topics:\nantidot behavior and zero-dimensional to one-dimensional tunneling. These\nmodels can be further applied to investigate a wide range of quantum transport\nphenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2009 14:24:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-02"}

We perform N-body simulations of\ninteracting galaxies to quantify this effect. We demonstrate that tidal\ncompression occurs repeatedly during a galaxy merger, independently of the\nspecific choice of parameterization. With a model tailored to the Antennae\ngalaxies, we show that the distribution of compressive tides matches the\nlocations and timescales of observed substructures.

At least four of them display a clear blue\nHB, indicating ages >10 Gyr. All six candidate young clusters are found to have\nages <1Gyr. With the present work the total number of M31 GCs with reliable\noptical CMD increases from 35 to 44 for the old clusters, and from 7 to 11 for\nthe young ones. The old clusters show similar characteristics to those of the\nMW. We discuss the case of the cluster B407, with a metallicity [Fe/H] ~-0.6\nand located at a large projected distance from the centre of M31 and from the\ngalaxy major axis. Metal-rich globulars at large galactocentric distances are\nrare both in M31 and in the MW. B407, in addition, has a velocity in stark\ncontrast with the rotation pattern shared by the bulk of M31 clusters of\nsimilar metallicity. This, along with other empirical evidence, supports the\nhypothesis that the cluster is physically associated with a substructure in the\nM31 halo that has been interpreted as the relic of a merging event.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2009 15:43:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}
