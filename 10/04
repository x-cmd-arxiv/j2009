Transmitted information is encoded in the helicity degrees of\nfreedom of two correlated momentum modes. The helicity encoding is considered\nto be particularly suitable for free-space communication. The integral part of\nthe story is information retrieval on the receiver's side.

The qubit consists of the singlet state and one of the triplet\nstates of two electrons or simply of an electron spin. These systems are free\nfrom the decoherence due to the nuclear dipole-dipole interaction and are\nadvantageous for the long memory time. In the case of two electrons, the\nprotocol for the quantum state transfer between the electron spin qubit and the\nnuclear spin qubit is based on the magnetic or electric field tuning of the\nsinglet-triplet state crossing and on the hyperfine coupling supplemented with\na well-defined scheme to initialize the nuclear spin. In the case of a single\nelectron qubit, the quantum state transfer is driven by the hyperfine\ninteraction itself without the need of the nuclear spin initialization. Many\npractical systems are considered, e.g., two electrons loaded on a Si or ZnSe\nquantum dot, a single electron charged state in a Si quantum dot doped with a P\natom, a single electron charged $ ^{28}$Si quantum dot doped with an isotope\natom of $ ^{29}$Si, and a localized electron system of Si:P and ZnSe:F in the\nbulk crystal.
