Our\nmodel is based on the Aquarius project, a suite of high resolution N-body\nsimulations of individual dark matter haloes. We tag subsets of particles in\nthese simulations with stellar populations predicted by the Galform\nsemi-analytic model. Our method self-consistently tracks the dynamical\nevolution and disruption of satellites from high redshift. The luminosity\nfunction and structural properties of surviving satellites, which agree well\nwith observations, suggest that this technique is appropriate. We find that\naccreted stellar haloes are assembled between 1<z<7 from less than 5\nsignificant progenitors. These progenitors are old, metal-rich satellites with\nstellar masses similar to the brightest Milky Way dwarf spheroidals. In\ncontrast to previous stellar halo simulations, we find that several of these\nmajor contributors survive as self-bound systems to the present day. Both the\nnumber of these significant progenitors and their infall times are inherently\nstochastic. This results in great diversity among our stellar haloes, which\namplifies small differences between the formation histories of their dark halo\nhosts. The masses and density/surface-brightness profiles of the stellar haloes\nare consistent with expectations from the Milky Way and M31. Each halo has a\ncomplex structure, consisting of well-mixed components, tidal streams, shells\nand other subcomponents. This structure is not adequately described by smooth\nmodels. We find one example of an accreted thick disk. Contrasts in age and\nmetallicity between halo stars and those in surviving satellites are in broad\nagreement with recent observations.

They are mainly B-type stars with their progenitors\nunknown. OB stars are also populated in the GC, with many being hosted in a\nclockwise-rotating young stellar (CWS) disk within half a parsec from the MBH\nand their formation remaining puzzles. In this paper, we demonstrate that HVSs\ncan well memorize the injecting directions of their progenitors using both\nanalytical arguments and numerical simulations, i.e., the ejecting direction of\nan HVS is almost anti-parallel to the injecting direction of its progenitor.\nTherefore, the spatial distribution of HVSs maps the spatial distribution of\nthe parent population of their progenitors directly. We also find that almost\nall the discovered HVSs are spatially consistent with being located on two thin\ndisk planes. The orientation of one plane is consistent with that of the\n(inner) CWS disk, which suggests that most of the HVSs originate from the CWS\ndisk or a previously existed disk-like stellar structure with an orientation\nsimilar to it. The rest of HVSs may be correlated with the plane of the\nnorthern arm of the mini-spiral in the GC or the plane defined by the outer\nwarped part of the CWS disk. Our results not only support the GC origin of HVSs\nbut also imply that the central disk (or the disk structure with a similar\norientation) should persist or be frequently rejuvenated over the past 200 Myr,\nwhich adds a new challenge to the stellar disk formation and provides insights\nto the longstanding problem of gas fueling into massive black holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2009 15:45:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-13"}

Any two states within the same class can be\ntransformed into each other with stochastic local operations and classical\ncommunication (SLOCC) with a non-zero probability. The optimal conversion\nprobability, however, is only known for special cases. Here, we derive new\nlower and upper bounds for the optimal probability of transformation from a\nGHZ-state to other states of the GHZ-class. A key idea in the derivation of the\nupper bounds is to consider the action of the LOCC protocol on a different\ninput state, namely $1/\\sqrt{2} [\\ket{000} - \\ket{111}]$, and demand that the\nprobability of an outcome remains bounded by 1. We also find an upper bound for\nmore general cases by using the constraints of the so-called interference term\nand 3-tangle. Moreover, we generalize some of our results to the case where\neach party holds a higher-dimensional system.

In particular, we make a frequentist comparison of the one- and\ntwo-point statistics for the dipole modulation and ACW models with data from\nthe five-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). This analysis is\nmotivated by previously revealed anomalies in the WMAP data, and particularly\nthe difference in the statistical nature of the temperature anisotropies when\nanalysed in hemispherical partitions.\n  The analysis of the one-point statistics indicates that the previously\ndetermined hemispherical variance difficulties can be apparently overcome by a\ndipole modulation field, but new inconsistencies arise if the mean and the\nl-dependence of the statistics are considered. The two-point correlation\nfunctions of the local extrema, the temperature pair product and the\npoint-point spatial pair-count, demonstrate that the impact of such a\nmodulation is to over-`asymmetrise' the temperature field on smaller scales\nthan the wave-length of the dipole or quadrupole, and this is disfavored by the\nobserved data.The results from the ACW model predictions, however, are\nconsistent with the standard isotropic hypothesis. The two-point analysis\nconfirms that the impact of this type of violation of isotropy on the\ntemperature extrema statistics is relatively weak.\n  From this work, we conclude that a model with more spatial structure than the\ndipole modulated or rotational-invariance breaking models are required to fully\nexplain the observed large-scale anomalies in the WMAP data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2009 03:11:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

This milestone\nis opening the path towards the definition of missions able to directly detect\nthe light from these planets, with the identification of bio-signatures as one\nof the main objectives. In that respect, both ESA and NASA have identified\nnulling interferometry as one of the most promising techniques. The ability to\nstudy distant planets will however depend on exozodiacal dust clouds\nsurrounding the target stars. In this paper, we assess the impact of\nexozodiacal dust clouds on the performance of an infrared nulling\ninterferometer in the Emma X-array configuration. For the nominal mission\narchitecture with 2-m aperture telescopes, we found that point-symmetric\nexozodiacal dust discs about 100 times denser than the solar zodiacal cloud can\nbe tolerated in order to survey at least 150 targets during the mission\nlifetime. Considering modeled resonant structures created by an Earth-like\nplanet orbiting at 1 AU around a Sun-like star, we show that the tolerable dust\ndensity for planet detection goes down to about 15 times the solar zodiacal\ndensity for face-on systems and decreases with the disc inclination. The upper\nlimits on the tolerable exozodiacal dust density derived in this study must be\nconsidered as rather pessimistic, but still give a realistic estimation of the\ntypical sensitivity that we will need to reach on exozodiacal discs in order to\nprepare the scientific programme of future Earth-like planet characterisation\nmissions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2009 09:45:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-20"}

As a result, nodes have to make\ndistributed decisions about their transmission and reception parameters based\non their local view of the network. In this paper, we characterize the impact\nof distributed decisions on the global network performance in terms of\nachievable sum-rates. We first formalize the concept of local view by proposing\na protocol abstraction using the concept of local message passing. In the\nproposed protocol, nodes forward information about the network state to other\nneighboring nodes, thereby allowing network state information to trickle to all\nthe nodes. The protocol proceeds in rounds, where all transmitters send a\nmessage followed by a message by all receivers. The number of rounds then\nprovides a natural metric to quantify the extent of local information at each\nnode.\n  We next study three network connectivities, Z-channel, a three-user double\nZ-channel and a reduced-parametrization $K$-user stacked Z-channel. In each\ncase, we characterize achievable sum-rate with partial message passing leading\nto three main results. First, in many cases, nodes can make distributed\ndecisions with only local information about the network and can still achieve\nthe same sum-capacity as can be attained with global information irrespective\nof the actual channel gains. Second, for the case of three-user double\nZ-channel, we show that universal optimality is not achievable if the per node\ninformation is below a threshold. Third, using reduced parametrization $K$-user\nchannel, we show that very few protocol rounds are needed for the case of very\nweak or very strong interference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2009 09:40:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-15"}

The high\neccentricity, coupled with the orientation of the binary orbit in space,\nexplains the very unusual observed light curve with strongly unequal primary\nand secondary eclipses having the depth ratio of 1-to-100 in the CoRoT 'seismo'\npassband. Without the high accuracy of the CoRoT photometry, the secondary\neclipse, 1.5 mmag deep, would have gone unnoticed. A spectroscopic follow-up\nprogram provided 45 high dispersion spectra. The analysis of the CoRoT light\ncurve was performed with an adapted version of PHOEBE that supports CoRoT\npassbands. The final solution was obtained by simultaneous fitting of the light\nand the radial velocity curves. Individual star spectra were derived by\nspectrum disentangling. The uncertainties of the fit were derived by bootstrap\nresampling and the solution uniqueness was tested by heuristic scanning. The\nresults provide a consistent picture of the system composed of two late B\nstars. The Fourier analysis of the light curve fit residuals yields two\ncomponents, with orbital frequency multiples and an amplitude of about 0.1\nmmag, which are tentatively interpreted as tidally induced pulsations. An\nextensive comparison with theoretical models is carried out by means of the\nLevenberg-Marquardt minimization technique and the discrepancy between models\nand the derived parameters is discussed. The best fitting models yield a young\nsystem age of 125 million years which is consistent with the eccentric orbit\nand synchronous component rotation at periastron.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2009 14:48:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The resulting\nemergent spectra are calculated using the relativistic ray-tracing method, in\nwhich we neglect the self-irradiation of the accretion disk. The angular\ndependence of the disk luminosity, the effects of the heat advection and the\ndisk thickness on the estimation of the black hole spin are discussed. Compare\nto the previous works, our improvements are that we use the self-consistent\ndisk equations and we consider the disk self-shadowing effect. We find that at\nthe moderate accretion rate, the radiation trapped in the outer region of the\naccretion disks will escape in the inner region of the accretion disk and\ncontribute to the emergent spectra. At the high accretion rate, for the large\ninclination and large black hole spin, both the disk thickness and the heat\nadvection have significant influence on the emergent spectra. Consequently,\nthese effects will influence the measurement of the black hole spin based on\nthe spectra fitting and influence the angular dependence of the luminosity. For\nthe disks around Kerr black holes with $a=0.98$, if the disk inclination is\ngreater than $60^\\circ$, and their luminosity is beyond 0.2 Eddington\nluminosity, the spectral model which is based on the relativistic standard\naccretion disk is no longer applicable for the spectra fitting. We also confirm\nthat the effect of the self-shadowing is significantly enhanced by the\nlight-bending, which implies that the non-relativistic treatment of the\nself-shadowing is inaccurate. According to our results, the observed luminosity\ndependence of the measured spin suggests that the disk self-shadowing\nsignificantly shapes the spectra of GRS 1915+105, which might lead to the\nunderestimation of the black hole spin for the high luminosity states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2009 11:42:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2009 02:03:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 1 May 2010 02:27:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

The main feature of this equation is the fact that even a globally\nbounded nonlinearity is \"supercritical\" in the case of two and three space\ndimensions. Thus the standard methods used for studying semilinear hyperbolic\nequations are not very effective in the present case.

Originally inspired by biological cells\nbehaviors, it fits also marketing, finance and many other application areas.\nCompetition is often unstable in the sense that strong agents, those having\naccess to large resources, gain more and more resources at the expense of weak\nagents. Thus, strong agents duplicate when reaching a critical amount of\nresources, whereas weak agents die when loosing all their resources. To capture\nall these phenomena we introduce systems with a discrete time gossip and\nunstable state dynamics interrupted by discrete events affecting the network\ntopology. Invariancy of states and topologies and network connectivity are\nexplored.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2009 15:28:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

A\nnoteworthy feature of the graphical representation is that it provides the\ncomplete global branch cut structure of the 7-brane solution which plays an\nimportant role in our analysis. We first identify those groups of branes which\nwhen made to coincide lead to the A-D-E-gauge groups. We next show that there\nis always a sufficient number of open BPS strings to account for all the\ngenerators of the gauge group. However, as we will show, there is in general no\none-to-one relation between BPS strings and gauge group generators.\n  For the D_{n+4}- and E-singularities, in order to relate BPS strings with\ngauge group generators, we make an SU(n+4), respectively SU(5) subgroup of the\nD_{n+4}- and E-gauge groups manifest. We find that only for the D-series (and\nfor the standard A-series) this is sufficient to identify, in a one-to-one\nmanner, which BPS strings correspond to which gauge group generators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2009 15:32:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-11"}

By comparing our results with\navailable experimental data as well as with state-of-the-art GW calculations,\nwe show that the HSE formalism is able to account well for the relevant\nproperties of these compounds and it emerges as an accurate tool for predictive\nfirst-principles investigations on multiferroic systems. We show that effects\nbeyond local and semilocal DFT approaches (as provided by HSE) are necessary\nfor a realistic description of MFs. For the electric polarization, a decrease\nis found for MFs with magnetically-induced ferroelectricity, such as HoMnO$_3$,\nwhere the calculated polarization changes from $\\sim$ 6 $\\mu C/cm^2$ using\nPerdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) to $\\sim$ 2 $\\mu C/cm^2$ using HSE. However, for\n\\textit{proper} MFs, such as BiFeO$_{3}$, the polarization slightly increases\nupon introduction of exact exchange.
