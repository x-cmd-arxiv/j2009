For intermediate F (i.e., in the transition\nregion) the response of the system, i.e., the distribution of the velocities of\nthe colloidal chains, in general does not coincide with the profile of the\ndriving force F(y), and depends on the magnitude of F, the width of the channel\nand the density of colloids. For example, we show that the onset of plasticity\nis first observed near the boundaries while the motion in the central region is\nelastic. This is explained by: (i) (in)commensurability between the chains due\nto the larger density of colloids near the boundaries, and (ii) the gradient in\nF. Our study provides a deeper understanding of the dynamics of colloids in\nchannels and could be accessed in experiments on colloids (or in dusty plasma)\nwith, e.g., asymmetric channels or in the presence of a gradient potential\nfield.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Oct 2009 17:27:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-05"}

They proposed to solve this problem by using\ninformation-theoretic tools, more precisely by minimizing the mutual\ninformation (MI) of the outputs of the separating structure. When applying the\nMI approach to BSS problems, one usually determines the analytical expressions\nof the derivatives of the MI with respect to the parameters of the considered\nseparating model. In the literature, these calculations were mainly reported\nfor linear mixtures up to now. They are more complex for nonlinear mixtures,\ndue to dependencies between the considered quantities. Moreover, the notations\ncommonly employed by the BSS community in such calculations may become\nmisleading when using them for nonlinear mixtures, due to the above-mentioned\ndependencies. We claim that the calculations reported in [4] contain an error,\nbecause they did not take into account all these dependencies. In this\ndocument, we therefore explain this phenomenon, by showing the effect of\nindirect dependencies on the application of the MI approach to the mixing and\nseparating models considered in [4]. We thus introduce a corrected expression\nof the gradient of the considered BSS criterion based on MI. This correct\ngradient may then e.g. be used to optimize the adaptive coefficients of the\nconsidered separating system by means of the well-known gradient descent\nalgorithm. As explained hereafter, this investigation has some similarities\nwith an analysis that we previously reported in another arXiv document [3].\nHowever, these two investigations concern different problems (mixture and\nseparating structure, mathematical tools: see paper).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Oct 2009 18:01:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 25 Oct 2009 19:20:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-26"}

The objective of this paper is to\nprovide and to apply a simple physical model for the evolution of the MF in\nstar clusters for a large range of the parameter space. The model is derived\nfrom the basic principles of two-body encounters and energy considerations. It\nis independent of the adopted mass loss rate or initial mass function (IMF),\nand contains stellar evolution, stellar remnant retention, dynamical\ndissolution in a tidal field, and mass segregation. It is found that the MF\nevolution in star clusters depends on the disruption time, remnant retention\nfraction, initial-final stellar mass relation, and IMF. Low-mass stars are\npreferentially ejected after t~400 Myr. Before that time, masses around 15-20%\nof the maximum stellar mass are lost. The degree of low-mass star depletion\ngrows for increasing disruption times, but can be quenched when the retained\nfraction of massive remnants is large. The highly depleted MFs of certain\nGalactic globular clusters are explained by the enhanced low-mass star\ndepletion that occurs for low remnant retention fractions. Unless the retention\nfraction is exceptionally large, dynamical evolution always decreases the\nmass-to-light ratio. The modeled evolution of the MF is consistent with N-body\nsimulations when adopting identical boundary conditions. However, it is found\nthat the results from N-body simulations only hold for their specific boundary\nconditions and should not be generalised to all clusters. It is concluded that\nthe model provides an efficient method do understand the evolution of the\nstellar MF in star clusters under widely varying conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Oct 2009 13:09:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

In 1982, Stanley defined what is\nnow called the Stanley depth of an $S$-module $M$, denoted $\\sdepth(M)$, and\nconjectured that $\\depth(M) \\le \\sdepth(M)$ for all finitely generated\n$S$-modules $M$. This conjecture remains open for most cases. However, Herzog,\nVladoiu and Zheng recently proposed a method of attack in the case when $M = I\n/ J$ with $J \\subset I$ being monomial $S$-ideals. Specifically, their method\nassociates $M$ with a partially ordered set. In this paper we take advantage of\nthis association by using combinatorial tools to analyze squarefree Veronese\nideals in $S$. In particular, if $I_{n,d}$ is the squarefree Veronese ideal\ngenerated by all squarefree monomials of degree $d$, we show that if $1\\le d\\le\nn < 5d+4$, then $\\sdepth(I_{n,d})= \\floor{\\binom{n}{d+1}\\Big/\\binom{n}{d}}+d$,\nand if $d\\geq 1$ and $n\\ge 5d+4$, then $d+3\\le \\sdepth(I_{n,d}) \\le\n\\floor{\\binom{n}{d+1}\\Big/\\binom{n}{d}}+d$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Oct 2009 11:40:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-27"}
