From Hubble Space Telescope observations\nwe find that Orcus and Vanth have different visible colors and that Vanth does\nnot share the water ice absorption feature seen in the infrared spectrum of\nOrcus. We also find that Vanth has a nearly face-on circular orbit with a\nperiod of 9.5393 +-0.0001 days and semimajor axis of 8980+-20 km, implying a\nsystem mass of 6.32+- 0.01 X 10^20 kg or 3.8% the mass of dwarf planet Eris.\n  From Spitzer Space Telescope observations we find that the thermal emission\nis consistent with a single body with diameter 940+-70 km and a geometric\nalbedo of 0.28+-0.04.

The orbit and mass ratio is consistent with\nformation from a giant impact and subsequent outward tidal evolution and even\nconsistent with the system having now achieved a double synchronous state.

That\ngenerating function is rational: the numerator has degree four and the\ndenominator has degree three. Let a column-duplex polyomino be a polyomino\nwhose columns can have either one or two connected components. A simplex-duplex\npolyomino is a column-duplex polyomino in which there is no occurrence of two\nadjacent columns each having two connected components. Simplex-duplex\npolyominoes are not easy to deal with, but their area generating function can\nstill be found. To find this generating function, we use an upgraded version of\nthe Temperley method. Though that technique is widely used in these times, our\napplication presents two interesting features. Firstly, we add one or two\ncolumns at a time, thus bypassing those simplex-duplex polyominoes which end\nwith a two-component column. (It is somewhat more usual to add just one column\nat a time.) Secondly, we obtain a functional equation that involves both the\nfirst and the second derivatives of the sought-for generating function. (Such\nequations usually involve the first derivative only. In some cases, no\nderivative is involved at all.) Right because of this latter interesting\nfeature, the Temperley method produces a very complicated formula for the\ngenerating function. Anyway, from that formula it is easy to compute Taylor\npolynomials. Thus we get plenty of evidence that the number of n-celled\nsimplex-duplex polyominoes behaves asymptotically as 0.119443*3.522020^n.

This orientation is related to the five epagomenal days in the end of\na year, which was probably the time of a Minoan festival. One of the\norientations of the Knossian Throne Room is towards the heliacal rising of\nSpica in 2000-1000 BCE. Spica rose heliacally at the time of vintage in Minoan\ntimes. The time near the date of the heliacal rising of Spica was the time of\nan important festival related to ctchonic deities, the Minoan predecessor of\nthe Eleusinian Mysteries. The myths of Minos, Demeter and Persephone probably\nhave an astronomical origin, related to Minoan observations of the periods of\nthe moon, Venus and Spica. These celestial events were related to the idea of\nrenewal, which was central in the Minoan religion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2009 12:31:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-27"}

The integrand is a fraction in which the numerator is a\nlogarithm of ratio of spacetime intervals, and the denominator is the product\nof powers of spacetime intervals.

Superconductivity exists at half-filling just at the border of the\nMott transition and extends away from half-filling into a whole region till a\ncritical doping, beyond which it gives way to a normal metal phase. This result\nsuggests that superconductivity should be unavoidably met by liquefying a\nvalence bond crystal, at least when each layer is an infinite coordination\nlattice and the Gutzwiller approximation becomes exact.

This campaign involved AGILE, Spitzer,\nSwift,Suzaku,the WEBT consortium,the REM and MITSuME telescopes,offering a\nbroad band coverage that allowed for a simultaneous sampling of the synchrotron\nand inverse Compton (IC) emissions.The 2-week AGILE monitoring was accompanied\nby radio to optical monitoring by WEBT and REM and by sparse observations in\nmid-Infrared and soft/hard X-ray energy bands performed by means of Target of\nOpportunity observations by Spitzer, Swift and Suzaku, respectively.The source\nwas detected with an average flux of~250x10^{-8}ph cm^-2s^-1 above 100\nMeV,typical of its flaring states.The simultaneous optical and gamma-ray\nmonitoring allowed us to study the time-lag associated with the variability in\nthe two energy bands, resulting in a possible ~1-day delay of the gamma-ray\nemission with respect to the optical one. From the simultaneous optical and\ngamma-ray fast flare detected on December 12, we can constrain the delay\nbetween the gamma-ray and optical emissions within 12 hours.

It does this with\nthe help of a distributed task force that has the intelligence to take action\nfrom a local and also a global perspective using its network of chemical\nmessengers for communication. There are two major branches of the immune\nsystem. The innate immune system is an unchanging mechanism that detects and\ndestroys certain invading organisms, whilst the adaptive immune system responds\nto previously unknown foreign cells and builds a response to them that can\nremain in the body over a long period of time. This remarkable information\nprocessing biological system has caught the attention of computer science in\nrecent years. A novel computational intelligence technique, inspired by\nimmunology, has emerged, called Artificial Immune Systems. Several concepts\nfrom the immune have been extracted and applied for solution to real world\nscience and engineering problems. In this tutorial, we briefly describe the\nimmune system metaphors that are relevant to existing Artificial Immune Systems\nmethods. We will then show illustrative real-world problems suitable for\nArtificial Immune Systems and give a step-by-step algorithm walkthrough for one\nsuch problem. A comparison of the Artificial Immune Systems to other well-known\nalgorithms, areas for future work, tips & tricks and a list of resources will\nround this tutorial off. It should be noted that as Artificial Immune Systems\nis still a young and evolving field, there is not yet a fixed algorithm\ntemplate and hence actual implementations might differ somewhat from time to\ntime and from those examples given here.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2009 14:54:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-05"}

We want to understand whether the observed\ndistribution of clusters is due to a primordial division into two distinct\nclasses rather than to differences in how these systems evolve across cosmic\ntime. We systematically search the ICM of NCC clusters in a subsample of the\nB55 flux limited sample of clusters for regions which have some characteristics\ntypical of cool cores, namely low entropy gas and high metal abundance We find\nthat most NCC clusters in our sample host regions reminiscent of CC, i. e.\ncharacterized by relative low entropy gas (albeit not as low as in CC systems)\nand a metal abundance excess. We have dubbed these structures \"cool core\nremnants\", since we interpret them as what remains of a cool core after a\nheating event (AGN giant outbursts in a few cases and more commonly mergers).\nWe infer that most NCC clusters have undergone a cool core phase during their\nlife. The fact that most cool core remnants are found in dynamically active\nobjects provides strong support to scenarios where cluster core properties are\nnot fixed \"ab initio\" but evolve across cosmic time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2009 15:08:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

For AGN population synthesis models to replicate\nthe peak region of the CXB (~30 keV), a highly obscured and therefore nearly\ninvisible class of AGN, known as Compton thick (CT) AGN, must be assumed to\ncontribute nearly a third of the CXB. In order to constrain the CT fraction of\nAGN and the CT number density we consider several hard X-ray AGN luminosity\nfunctions and the contribution of blazars to the CXB. Following the unified\nscheme, the radio AGN luminosity function is relativistically beamed to create\na radio blazar luminosity function. An average blazar spectral energy density\nmodel is created to transform radio luminosity to X-ray luminosity. We find the\nblazar contribution to the CXB to be 12% in the 0.5-2 keV band, 7.4% in the\n2-10 keV band, 8.9% in the 15-55 keV band, and 100% in the MeV region. When\nblazars are included in CXB synthesis models, CT AGN are predicted to be\nroughly one-third of obscured AGN, in contrast to the prediction of one half if\nblazars are not considered.

The determination of the best\npossible observing strategies is a very important choice in order to build up a\nrepresentative sample of spectroscopically confirmed sources at high-z (z>7),\nbeyond the limits of present-day observations. This paper is intended to\nprecisely adress the relative efficiency of lensing and blank fields in the\nidentification and study of galaxies at 6<z<12. The detection efficiency and\nfield-to-field variance are estimated from direct simulations of both blank and\nlensing fields observations. The presence of a strong-lensing cluster along the\nline of sight has a dramatic effect on the number of observed sources, with a\npositive magnification bias in typical ground-based ``shallow'' surveys\n(AB<~25.5). The positive magnification bias increases with the redshift of\nsources and decreases with both depth of the survey and the size of the\nsurveyed area. The maximum efficiency is reached for lensing clusters at\nz~0.1-0.3. Observing blank fields in shallow surveys is particularly\ninefficient as compared to lensing fields if the UV LF for LBGs is strongly\nevolving at z>~7. Also in this case, the number of z>8 sources expected at the\ntypical depth of JWST (AB~28-29) is much higher in lensing than in blank fields\n(e.g. a factor of ~10 for AB<~28). Blank field surveys with a large field of\nview are needed to prove the bright end of the LF at z>6-7, whereas lensing\nclusters are particularly useful for exploring the mid to faint end of the LF.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2009 15:49:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}
