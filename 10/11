In the standard Compressed Sensing paradigm, the\n$\\m\\times \\n$ measurement matrix $\\A$ is required to act as a near isometry on\nthe set of all $k$-sparse signals (Restricted Isometry Property or RIP).\nAlthough it is known that certain probabilistic processes generate $\\m \\times\n\\n$ matrices that satisfy RIP with high probability, there is no practical\nalgorithm for verifying whether a given sensing matrix $\\A$ has this property,\ncrucial for the feasibility of the standard recovery algorithms. In contrast\nthis paper provides simple criteria that guarantee that a deterministic sensing\nmatrix satisfying these criteria acts as a near isometry on an overwhelming\nmajority of $k$-sparse signals; in particular, most such signals have a unique\nrepresentation in the measurement domain. Probability still plays a critical\nrole, but it enters the signal model rather than the construction of the\nsensing matrix. We require the columns of the sensing matrix to form a group\nunder pointwise multiplication. The construction allows recovery methods for\nwhich the expected performance is sub-linear in $\\n$, and only quadratic in\n$\\m$; the focus on expected performance is more typical of mainstream signal\nprocessing than the worst-case analysis that prevails in standard Compressed\nSensing.

A nonlinear dependence of the\nabsorption coefficient on the solute concentration is predicted and originates\nfrom the mutual polarization of the liquid surrounding the solutes by the\ncollective field of the solute dipoles aligned along the radiation field. The\ntheory is applied to terahertz absorption of hydrated saccharides and proteins.\nWhile the theory gives an excellent account of the observations for saccharides\nwithout additional assumptions and fitting parameters, experimental absorption\ncoefficient of protein solutions significantly exceeds theoretical calculations\nwithin standard dielectric models and shows a peak against the protein\nconcentration. A substantial polarization of protein's hydration shell is\nrequired to explain the differences between standard theories and experiment.\nWhen the correlation function of the total dipole moment of the protein with\nits hydration shell from numerical simulations is used in the present\nanalytical model an absorption peak similar to that seen is experiment is\nobtained.

In this work we measured and characterized the EDEF, excited by a\nharmonical thermal wave. We present here experimental results obtained on a\npyroelectric crystal LiTaO3, confirming our theoretical predictions. We present\nthe theoretical analysis and description of the thermal wave and the induced\nharmonically varying EDEF. The calculations assume an equivalent circuit of a\npyroelectric capacitive current source. The measured magnitude of the EDEF and\nits spatial variation agree well with the theoretical model. The effect of the\nair pressure at the pyroelectric/air interface, on the EDEF, was determined in\nthe interval 10^3 - 10^-6 torr. We found that EDEF increases significantly with\ndecreasing air pressure, presumably due to diminishing of adsorption screening\nat the polar faces. Teflon plates, covering the polar faces, prevent\naccumulation of screening charged particles, resulting in a drastic increase of\nEDEF.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Oct 2009 12:03:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Without deliberate coordination and cooperation\namong the active links, there is a naturally occurring misalignment between the\nsymbols of the targeted signal of a receiver and the symbols of the interfering\nsignals. Interestingly, we show that the interference asynchrony can actually\nimprove the BER performance, compared with the situation in which symbols of al\nsignals ay aligned. In particular, we show that symbol misalignment can\ndecrease the \"effective interference power\" and change the distribution of the\ninterfering signals, in a way that results in lower BER. To ensure that symbol\nmisalignment can be consistently attained, we propose two simple schemes that\nintroduce time-varying symbol offsets to obtain an \"average\" performance of\nrandom symbol misalignment.

Employing the Green\nfunction appropriate to the given channel geometry, an implicit integral\nrepresentation for the burnt gas velocity is constructed. It is then used to\nderive an explicit expression for rotational component of the gas velocity near\nthe flame front by successive separation of irrotational contributions. We\nprove that this separation can be performed in a way consistent with boundary\nconditions at the channel walls. As a result, the unknown irrotational\ncomponent can be projected out by applying a dispersion relation, thus leading\nto a closed system of equations for the on-shell fresh gas velocity and the\nflame front position. These equations show that in addition to the usual\nnonlocality associated with potential flows, vorticity produced by a curved\nflame leads to specific nonlocal spatial and temporal influence of the channel\ngeometry on the flame evolution. To elucidate this influence, three special\ncases are considered in more detail -- steady flame stabilized by incoming flow\nin a bottle-shaped channel, quasi-steady flame, and unsteady flame with small\ngas expansion propagating in a channel with slowly varying width. In the latter\ncase, analytical solutions of the derived equations are obtained in the first\npost-Sivashinsky approximation using the method of pole decomposition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Oct 2009 14:58:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-13"}
