Unsatisfiable\ninstances were therefore commonly solved using backtrack search solvers. For\nthis reason, in the late 90s Selman, Kautz and McAllester proposed a challenge\nto use local search instead to prove unsatisfiability. More recently, two SLS\nsolvers - Ranger and Gunsat - have been developed, which are able to prove\nunsatisfiability albeit being SLS solvers.

In particular, the power of\nthe quadrupole moment of the CMB fluctuations is remarkably low, and the\nquadrupole and octopole moments are aligned mutually and with the geometry of\nthe Solar system. It has been suggested in the literature that microwave sky\npollution by an unidentified dust cloud in the vicinity of the Solar system may\nbe the cause for these anomalies. In this paper, we simulate the thermal\nemission by clouds of spherical homogeneous particles of several materials.\nSpectral constraints from the WMAP multi-wavelength data and earlier infrared\nobservations on the hypothetical dust cloud are used to determine the dust\ncloud's physical characteristics. In order for its emissivity to demonstrate a\nflat, CMB-like wavelength dependence over the WMAP wavelengths (3 through 14\nmm), and to be invisible in the infrared light, its particles must be\nmacroscopic. Silicate spheres from several millimetres in size and carbonaceous\nparticles an order of magnitude smaller will suffice. According to our\nestimates of the abundance of such particles in the Zodiacal cloud and\ntrans-neptunian belt, yielding the optical depths of the order of 1E-7 for each\ncloud, the Solar-system dust can well contribute 10 microKelvin (within an\norder of magnitude) in the microwaves. This is not only intriguingly close to\nthe magnitude of the anomalies (about 30 microKelvin), but also alarmingly\nabove the presently believed magnitude of systematic biases of the WMAP results\n(below 5 microKelvin) and, to an even greater degree, of the future missions\nwith higher sensitivities, e.g. PLANCK.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2009 16:59:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

However, if one restricts attention to abelian groups then not all\nentropy vectors can be obtained. This is an explanation for the fact shown by\nDougherty et al that linear network codes cannot achieve capacity in general\nnetwork coding problems (since linear network codes form an abelian group). All\nabelian group-characterizable vectors, and by fiat all entropy vectors\ngenerated by linear network codes, satisfy a linear inequality called the\nIngleton inequality. In this paper, we study the problem of finding nonabelian\nfinite groups that yield characterizable vectors which violate the Ingleton\ninequality. Using a refined computer search, we find the symmetric group S_5 to\nbe the smallest group that violates the Ingleton inequality. Careful study of\nthe structure of this group, and its subgroups, reveals that it belongs to the\nIngleton-violating family PGL(2,p) with primes p > 3, i.e., the projective\ngroup of 2 by 2 nonsingular matrices with entries in F_p.

The SU(2)F flavor symmetry is introduced to provide\nthe origin of hierarchical structures of Yukawa coupling and to ensure the\nuniversality of sfermion soft masses. The anomalous U(1)A symmetry is\nintroduced to realize the doublet-triplet mass splitting, to provide the origin\nof hierarchical structures of Yukawa couplings, and to solve the mu problem. In\nthe model, CP is spontaneously broken by the SU(2)F breaking in order to\nprovide a Kobayashi-Maskawa phase and to evade the supersymmetric CP problem.\nHowever, a naive construction of the model generally leads to unwanted outcome,\nArg[mu b*]=O(1), when CP violating effects in the flavor sector are taken into\naccount.

A central example in the field of mesoscopic\nphysics is the localization-delocalization (metal-insulator) quantum phase\ntransition driven by disorder -- the Anderson transition. Although the notion\nof localization has appeared half a century ago, this field is still full of\nsurprising new developments. The most recent arenas where novel peculiar\nlocalization phenomena have been studied are graphene and topological\ninsulators, i.e., bulk insulators with delocalized (topologically protected)\nstates on their surface. Besides exciting physical properties, the topological\nprotection renders such systems promising candidates for a variety of\nprospective electronic and spintronic devices. It is thus of crucial importance\nto understand properties of boundary metallic modes in the realistic systems\nwhen both disorder and interaction are present. Here we find a novel critical\nstate which emerges in the bulk of two-dimensional quantum spin Hall (QSH)\nsystems and on the surface of three-dimensional topological insulators with\nstrong spin-orbit interaction due to the interplay of nontrivial Z_2 topology\nand the Coulomb repulsion. At low temperatures, this state possesses a\nuniversal value of electrical conductivity. In particular, we predict that the\ndirect QSH phase transition occurs via this novel state. Remarkably, the\ninteraction-induced critical state emerges on the surface of a\nthree-dimensional topological insulator without any adjustable parameters. This\n``self-organized quantum criticality'' is a novel concept in the field of\ninteracting disordered systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2009 19:51:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-19"}

One of the strongest candidates to date is the hyperluminous X-ray\nsource HLX1, possibly located in the S0-a galaxy ESO243-49, but the lack of an\nidentifiable optical counterpart had hampered its interpretation. Using the\nMagellan telescope, we have discovered an unresolved optical source with R =\n(23.80 +/- 0.25) mag and V = (24.5 +/- 0.3) mag within HLX1's positional error\ncircle. This implies an average X-ray/optical flux ratio ~ 500.

(ii) High star formation\nefficiency for a rapid BH growth. We also find that if the BH growth is limited\nby the Eddington accretion, the final BH mass is greatly suppressed. Thus, the\nsuper-Eddington growth is required for the QSO formation. The evolution of the\nQSO luminosity depends on the redshift z_{i} at which accretion onto a seed BH\nis initiated. In other words, the brighter QSOs at z >6 favor the late growth\nof SMBHs (i.e., z_{i}=10) rather than early growth (i.e., z_{i}=30).

Moreover, we prove that, for fixed viscosity, $\\nu>0$, as the\nregularizing parameter $\\alpha$ tends to zero, there exists a subsequence of\nprobability invariant measures converging, in a suitable sense, to a strong\nstationary statistical solution of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes\nequations, which is a regularized version of the notion of stationary\nstatistical solutions - a generalization of the concept of invariant measure\nintroduced and investigated by Foias. This fact supports earlier numerical\nobservations, and provides an additional evidence that, for small values of the\nregularization parameter $\\alpha$, the Navier-Stokes-Voigt model can indeed be\nconsidered as a model to study the statistical properties of the\nthree-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations and turbulent flows via direct\nnumerical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2009 01:46:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-09"}

For example, when the analysis\nconsiders the cases X<Y and X>Y separately, one might have to be especially\ncareful about what happens when X=Y. On the other hand, experience tells us\nthat when a yet unregarded special case of this kind is discovered, one nearly\nalways finds a way to handle it. This is typically done by modifying the\nanalysis and/or the algorithm very slightly.\n  In this article we substantiate this observation theoretically. We\nconcentrate on deterministic algorithms for weighted combinatorial optimization\nproblems. A problem instance of this kind is defined by its structure and a\nvector of weights. The concept of a null case is introduced as set of problem\ninstances whose weight vectors constitute a nowhere open set (or null set) in\nthe space of all possible weight configurations. An algorithm is called robust\nif any null case can be disregarded in the analysis of both its solution\nquality and resource requirements.\n  We show that achieving robustness is only a matter of breaking ties the right\nway. More specifically, we show that the concept of symbolic perturbation known\nfrom the area of geometric algorithms guarantees that no surprises will happen\nin null cases. We argue that for a huge class of combinatorial optimization\nalgorithms it is easy to verify that they implicitly use symbolic perturbation\nfor breaking ties and thus can be analyzed under the assumption that some\narbitrary null case never occurs. Finally, we prove that there exists a\nsymbolic perturbation tie breaking policy for any algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2009 02:23:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2009 09:00:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-04"}

The main issue is to cope with kinetic-like, momentum (p^2) dependent\neffective interactions that arise at this order. They spoil the unitarity of\nthe connection between flavor and mass states, which potentially alters the\nstandard Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) phenomenology by giving rise, in\nparticular, to extra flavor changing neutral currents (FCNC). We explore the\nconservative requirement that these should be suppressed, which yields\nrelations between the CKM angles, the fermion and $W$ masses, and a\nrenormalization scale $\\mu$. For two generations, two solutions arise: either\nthe mixing angle of the fermion pair the closer to degeneracy is close to\nmaximal while, inversely, the mass and flavor states of the other pair are\nquasi-aligned, or mixing angles in both sectors are very small. For three\ngenerations, all mixing angles of neutrinos are predicted to be large\n(theta_{23}, close to maximal, is the largest) and the smallness of their mass\ndifferences induces mass-flavor quasi-alignment for all charged leptons. The\nhadronic sector differs in that the top quark is twice as heavy as the W. The\nsituation is, there, bleaker, as all angles come out too large, but,\nnevertheless, encouraging, because theta_{12} decreases as the top mass\nincreases. Whether other super-heavy fermions could drag it down to realistic\nvalues stays an open issue, together with the role of higher order corrections.\nThe same type of counterterms that turned off the 4th order static corrections\nto the quark electric dipole moment are, here too, needed, in particular to\nstabilize quantum corrections to mixing angles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2009 15:06:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Jun 2010 07:03:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-16"}

These measurements cover\nseveral years or decades. The Delta Scuti stars provide more information (than\nclassical pulsators) since a number of simultaneously excited radial and\nnonradial modes can be studied. The present results indicate the presence of at\nleast two effects: beating of independent modes with close frequencies and\nstellar cycles. For period and amplitude changes with time scales less than one\nyear, we confirm the beating hypothesis in three stars. This is shown by the\ncorrectly correlated relationship between amplitude and phase changes as well\nas the repetitions of these cycles. However, the observed period variations\nwith longer time scales are not due to simple beating between two close\nfrequencies. For the star 4 CVn we can derive accurate annual frequency values\nfor at least seven radial and nonradial modes. The annual phases are in\nexcellent agreement with predictions from nearby years, thereby confirming the\nvalues and their observed long-term changes. For prograde and retrograde modes,\nthe period variations are of identical size, but with opposite signs. The\nradial mode shows no (or little) changes.

In digital communication the problem\nis equivalent to performing Maximum Likelihood (ML) detection in Multiple-Input\nMultiple-Output (MIMO) systems. While the use of MCMC methods for such problems\nhas already been proposed, our method is novel in that we optimize the\n\"temperature\" parameter so that in steady state, i.e. after the Markov chain\nhas mixed, there is only polynomially (rather than exponentially) small\nprobability of encountering the optimal solution. More precisely, we obtain the\nlargest value of the temperature parameter for this to occur, since the higher\nthe temperature, the faster the mixing. This is in contrast to simulated\nannealing techniques where, rather than being held fixed, the temperature\nparameter is tended to zero. Simulations suggest that the resulting Gibbs\nsampler provides a computationally efficient way of achieving approximative ML\ndetection in MIMO systems having a huge number of transmit and receive\ndimensions. In fact, they further suggest that the Markov chain is rapidly\nmixing. Thus, it has been observed that even in cases were ML detection using,\ne.g. sphere decoding becomes infeasible, the Gibbs sampler can still offer a\nnear-optimal solution using much less computations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2009 10:57:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-09"}

We consider the following two key issues in the\nproposed architecture (1) Prefix caching technique to accommodate more number\nof videos close to client (2) Cooperative client and proxy chaining to achieve\nthe network efficiency. Our simulation results shows that the proposed approach\nyields a prefix caching close to the optimal solution minimizing WAN bandwidth\nusage on server-proxy path by utilizing the proxy-client and client-client path\nbandwidth, which is much cheaper than the expensive server proxy path\nbandwidth, server load, and client rejection ratio significantly using\nchaining.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2009 11:26:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-09"}

The question of atmosphere retention is a\nfundamental one, especially for planets orbiting M stars due to the star's\nlong-duration active phase and corresponding potential for stellar-induced\nplanetary atmospheric escape and erosion. Tidally-locked planets with no\natmosphere are expected to show a Lambertian-like thermal phase curve, causing\nthe combined light of the planet-star system to vary with planet orbital phase.\n  We report Spitzer 8 micron IRAC observations of GJ 876 taken over 32\ncontinuous hours and reaching a relative photometric precision of 3.9e-04 per\npoint for 25.6 s time sampling. This translates to a 3 sigma limit of 5.13e-05\non a planet thermal phase curve amplitude. Despite the almost photon-noise\nlimited data, we are unable to conclusively infer the presence of an atmosphere\nor rule one out on the non-transiting short-period super Earth GJ 876d. The\nlimiting factor in our observations was the miniscule, monotonic photometric\nvariation of the slightly active host M star, because the partial sine wave due\nto the planet has a component in common with the stellar linear trend. The\nproposed method is nevertheless very promising for transiting hot super Earths\nwith the James Webb Space Telescope and is critical for establishing\nobservational constraints for atmospheric escape.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2009 13:55:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

For this scenario, an interesting question is whether the relay node\nshould be deployed at all. That is, whether cooperation with an untrusted relay\nnode can ever be beneficial. We first provide an achievable secrecy rate for\nthe general untrusted relay channel, and proceed to investigate this question\nfor two types of relay networks with orthogonal components. For the first\nmodel, there is an orthogonal link from the source to the relay. For the second\nmodel, there is an orthogonal link from the relay to the destination. For the\nfirst model, we find the equivocation capacity region and show that answer is\nnegative. In contrast, for the second model, we find that the answer is\npositive. Specifically, we show by means of the achievable secrecy rate based\non compress-and-forward, that, by asking the untrusted relay node to relay\ninformation, we can achieve a higher secrecy rate than just treating the relay\nas an eavesdropper. For a special class of the second model, where the relay is\nnot interfering itself, we derive an upper bound for the secrecy rate using an\nargument whose net effect is to separate the eavesdropper from the relay. The\nmerit of the new upper bound is demonstrated on two channels that belong to\nthis special class. The Gaussian case of the second model mentioned above\nbenefits from this approach in that the new upper bound improves the previously\nknown bounds. For the Cover-Kim deterministic relay channel, the new upper\nbound finds the secrecy capacity when the source-destination link is not worse\nthan the source-relay link, by matching with the achievable rate we present.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2009 13:59:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

This CFT generically\nlifts the weights in the bosonic sector, giving rise to a spectrum with fewer\nmassless states. We identify more than 30 such lifts, and we expect many more\nto exist.

I will highlight the need to better understand the\nnear-IR spectral range and outline the difficulties presented by less well\nunderstood phases of stellar evolution such as thermally pulsing AGB stars,\nhorizontal branch stars and the very first stars. The influence of rotation and\nbinarity on stellar population modeling is also briefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2009 15:36:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

We use the\nsequence $c_k$ appearing in the \\BD criterion for the RH.
