However,\nsince reionization is expected to be highly inhomogeneous, much of the spectra\npass through just the ionized component of the intergalactic medium (IGM) even\nfor non-negligible values of the volume-weighted mean neutral hydrogen\nfraction, x_HI. We study the expected signature of an incomplete reionization\nat z ~ 5--6, using very large-scale (2 Gpc) seminumeric simulations. We find\nthat ruling out an incomplete reionization is difficult at these redshifts\nsince: (1) quasars reside in biased regions of the ionization field, with fewer\nsurrounding HI patches than implied by the global mean, x_H; (2) absorption\nfrom the residual neutral hydrogen inside the ionized IGM generally dominates\nover the absorption from the remaining HI regions; (3) modeling the Lyman alpha\nforest and its redshift evolution even in just the ionized IGM is very\ndifficult, and nearly impossible to do a priori. We propose using the fraction\nof pixels which are dark as a simple, nearly model-independent upper limit on\nx_HI. Alternately, the size distribution of regions with no detectable flux\n(dark gaps) can be used to place a more model dependent constraint. Either way,\nthe current sample of quasars is statistically insufficient to constrain x_HI\nat z~6 to even the 10 per cent level. At z~5, where there are more available\nsightlines and the forest is less dark, constraining x_HI < 0.1 might be\npossible given a large dynamic range from very deep spectra and/or the Lyman\nbeta forest. We conclude with the caution against over-interpreting the\nobservations.

The studies indicate that the amplitudes of temperature fluctuations\nare higher in one hemisphere than in the other. We consider whether this\nasymmetry could originate from a large scale inhomogeneity in the gravitational\nfield enclosing the present Hubble volume. We examine what effect the presence\nof an inhomogeneity in the gravitational field of size larger than the present\nHubble radius would have on the temperature distribution of the CMB and start\neliciting its observational signature in the CMB power spectrum. The covariance\nfunction contains, in addition to the diagonal entries of the conventional CMB\ntemperature anisostropy power spectrum, non-diagonal entries. We find that\nspecific non-diagonal entries of the covariance function are sensitive to the\nstrength of the inhomogeneity, while the diagonal entries are not. These\nnon-diagonal entries, which are not present in the case of a homogeneous\nbackground geometry, are observational signatures of a large-scale\ninhomogeneity in the background geometry of the universe. Furthermore, we find\nthat an inhomogeneity in the gravitational potential of super-Hubble size would\nyield a power asymmetry in the CMB with maximal asymmetry at an angle of 90\ndegrees to the CMB dipole axis. The axis of the CMB power asymmetry was\nrecently estimated by Eriksen et. al. to be located at angles between 83 and 96\ndegrees to the CMB dipole axis, which is consistent with the prediction of our\nmodel. This implies that the location of the observed power asymmetry in the\nCMB sky could be accounted for by a large-scale inhomogeneity in the\ngravitational field enclosing the present Hubble volume.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2009 07:22:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Jan 2010 04:24:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-05"}

Hence, our media-aware solution is able to provide differential\nservices for transmitting various packet classes and thereby, further improves\nthe multimedia streaming quality. We model this problem using a Finite-Horizon\nMarkov Decision Process (FHMDP) and determine the optimal congestion control\npolicy that maximizes the long-term multimedia quality, while adhering to the\nhorizon- TCP-friendliness constraint, which ensures long-term fairness with\nexisting TCP applications. We show that the FHMDP problem can be decomposed\ninto multiple optimal stopping problems, which admit a low-complexity\nthreshold-based solution. Moreover, unlike existing congestion control\napproaches, which focus on maintaining throughput-based fairness among users,\nthe proposed media-TCP aims to achieve quality-based fairness among multimedia\nusers. We also derive sufficient conditions for multiple multimedia users to\nachieve quality-based fairness using media-TCP congestion control. Our\nsimulation results show that the proposed media-TCP achieves more than 3dB\nimprovement in terms of PSNR over the conventional TCP congestion control\napproaches, with the largest improvements observed for real-time streaming\napplications requiring stringent playback delays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2009 21:53:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-23"}

On the other hand, this class of games does not model well the\ncongestion or resource sharing in a wireless context, a prominent feature of\nwhich is spatial reuse. What this translates to in the context of a congestion\ngame is that a users payoff for using a resource (interpreted as a channel) is\na function of the its number of its interfering users sharing that channel,\nrather than the total number among all users.

We locate these phases in a dynamical\nphase diagram. We demonstrate that the apparent power-law orientational\ncorrelations we obtain in our moving hexatic phase arise from circularly\naveraging an orientational correlation function with qualitatively different\nbehaviour in the longitudinal (drive) and transverse directions. The\nintermediate coexistence regime exhibits several novel properties, including\nsubstantial enhancement in the current noise, an unusual power-law spectrum of\ncurrent fluctuations and striking metastability effects. This noise arises from\nthe fluctuations of the interface separating locally square and triangular\nordered regions. We demonstrate the breakdown of effective ``shaking\ntemperature'' treatments in the coexistence regime by showing that such shaking\ntemperatures are non-monotonic functions of the drive in this regime. Finally\nwe discuss the relevance of these simulations to the anomalous behaviour seen\nin the peak effect regime of vortex lines in the disordered mixed phase of\ntype-II superconductors.

The\ngeneral expectation has been that the atmospheres of those substellar-mass\nobjects with condensate clouds would give rise to linear polarization due to\nscattering. Because of rotation-induced non-sphericity, there is expected to be\nincomplete cancellation of disk-integrated net polarization and thus a finite\npolarization. For cloudless objects, however, only molecular Rayleigh\nscattering will contribute to any net polarization and this limit has not been\nwell studied. Hence in this paper we present a detailed multiple scattering\nanalysis of the polarization expected from those T-dwarfs whose spectra show\nabsence of condensates. For this, we develop and solve the full radiative\ntransfer equations for linearly polarized radiation. Only atomic and molecular\nRayleigh scattering are considered to be the source of polarization. We compute\nthe local polarization at different angular directions in a plane-parallel\natmospheres calculated for the range of effective temperatures of T dwarfs and\nthen average over the whole surface of the object. The effects of gravity and\nlimb darkening as well as rotation induced non-sphericity are included. It is\nfound that the amount of polarization decreases with the increase in effective\ntemperature. It is also found that significant polarization at any local point\nin the atmosphere arises only in the optical (B-band). However, the disk\nintegrated polarization--even in the B-band--is negligible. Hence we conclude\nthat, unlike the case for cloudy L dwarfs, polarization of cloudless T-dwarfs\nby atomic and molecular scattering may not be detectable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2009 07:06:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

Evolution of the emission takes place, the energy falling but the flux\nincreasing strongly, consistent with production in the large volume of unstable\nnuclear burning around the neutron star which eventually cools.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2009 09:18:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-23"}

Miniature\nradio galaxies smoothly extend the relationships found for the more powerful\nFRI radio galaxies between emission line, optical and radio nuclear\nluminosities to lower levels. However, they have a deficit of a factor of ~100\nin extended radio emission with respect to that of the classical example of\n3CR/FRI.

Such sources form\nthe bulk of the population of radio-loud AGN in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.\nAt a given level of nuclear emission, one can find radio sources with an\nextremely wide range, a factor of >~100, of radio power.

There are\nseveral observations which lack a clear explanation, for instance: the absence\nof bright QSOs at low redshifts, a mysterious evolution not properly\nunderstood; the inconsistencies of the absorption lines, such as the different\nstructure of the clouds along the QSO's line of sight and their tangential\ndirections; the spatial correlation between QSOs and galaxies; and many others.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2009 11:35:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 2009 17:25:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 12 May 2011 17:51:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-20"}

We also find that the critical behavior is well\ndescribed by the scaling form previously found for regular hyperbolic lattices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2009 14:50:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The transport properties\nof the wire are derived from a numerical Landauer technique which provides the\nconductance of the wire as a function of the disorder configuration. We show\nthat the correlation of conductance between two spin configurations provides a\nmeasure of the correlation between these spin configurations. This correlation\ncorresponds to the mean field overlap in the absence of any spatial order\nbetween the spin configurations. Moreover, we find that these conductance\ncorrelations are sensitive to the spatial order between the two spin\nconfigurations, i.e whether the spin ?ips between them occur in a compact\nregion or not.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2009 14:57:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-25"}

As a\nfully consistent extension of the relativistic quasiparticle random phase\napproximation (RQRPA), the two-phonon RQTBA implies a fragmentation of nuclear\nstates over two-quasiparticle and two-phonon configurations. This leads, in\nparticular, to a splitting-out of the lowest 1$^-$ state as a member of the\ntwo-phonon $[2^+\\otimes3^-]$ quintuplet from the RQRPA pygmy dipole mode, thus\nestablishing a physical mixing between these three modes.

The new high energy sky is in fact full of a large variety\nof normal, very energetic emitters, characterized by new accretion and\nacceleration processes (see also IBIS cat4, Bird et al. 2009). If compared to\nprevious IBIS/ISGRI surveys it is clear that there is a continual increase in\nthe rate of discoveries of HMXB and AGN, including a variety of distant QSOs.\nThis is basically due to increased exposure away from the Galactic Plane, while\nthe percentage of sources without an identification has remained constant. At\nthe same time, about one GRB/month is detected and imaged by the two main\ngamma-ray instruments on board: IBIS and SPI. INTEGRAL, after six and half\nyears of observations, has completed the Core Programme phase and is now fully\nopen to the scientific community for Open Time and Key Programme observations,\nwith AO7 recently announced by ESA.
