There are four types of corrections:\ncorrections to the lensing shear due to multiple-deflections; corrections due\nto the fact that shape distortions probe the reduced shear $\\gamma/(1-\\kappa)$\nrather than the shear itself; corrections associated with the non-linear\nconversion of reduced shear to mean ellipticity; and corrections due to the\nfact that observational galaxy selection and shear measurement is based on\ngalaxy brightnesses and sizes which have been (de)magnified by lensing.

In the submillimeter regime, Sgr A* exhibits time-variable\nlinear polarization on timescales corresponding to <10 Schwarzschild radii of\nthe presumed 4 million solar mass black hole. In previous work, we demonstrated\nthe potential for total-intensity (sub)millimeter-wavelength VLBI to detect\ntime-variable -- and periodic -- source structure changes in the Sgr A* black\nhole system using nonimaging analyses. Here we extend this work to include full\npolarimetric VLBI observations. We simulate full-polarization (sub)millimeter\nVLBI data of Sgr A* using a hot-spot model that is embedded within an accretion\ndisk, with emphasis on nonimaging polarimetric data products that are robust\nagainst calibration errors. Although the source-integrated linear polarization\nfraction in the models is typically only a few percent, the linear polarization\nfraction on small angular scales can be much higher, enabling the detection of\nchanges in the polarimetric structure of Sgr A* on a wide variety of baselines.\nThe shortest baselines track the source-integrated linear polarization\nfraction, while longer baselines are sensitive to polarization substructures\nthat are beam-diluted by connected-element interferometry. The detection of\nperiodic variability in source polarization should not be significantly\naffected even if instrumental polarization terms cannot be calibrated out. As\nmore antennas are included in the (sub)mm-VLBI array, observations with full\npolarization will provide important new diagnostics to help disentangle\nintrinsic source polarization from Faraday rotation effects in the accretion\nand outflow region close to the black hole event horizon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2009 16:03:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

Or they can in turn fuse with or be captured by\nan un-reacted deuteron. The average center-of-mass (COM) energy for such\nreaction is around 10 keV in a typical fusion reactor, but could be as low as 1\nkeV. At this low COM energy, the reacting nucleons are in an s-wave state in\nterms of their relative angular momentum. The single-gamma radiation process is\nthus strongly suppressed due to conservation laws. Instead the gamma ray\nreleased is likely to be accompanied by x-ray photons from a nuclear\nbremsstrahlung process. The x-ray thus generated has a continuous spectrum and\npeaks around a few hundred eV to a few keV. The average photon energy and\nspectrum properties of such a process are calculated with a semiclassical\napproach. The results give a peak near 1.1 keV for the proton-deuteron fusion\nand a power-to-the-minus-second law in the spectrum's high-energy limit. An\nanalysis of some prior tokamak discharge data shows that this phenomenon might\nhave been observed before and it may lead to new plasma diagnostics which are\nmore sensitive to the ionic or nuclear degree of freedom. This phenomenon\nshould also play a role in nuclear astrophysics as one of the sources for\nastrophysical x-rays. The process contributes particularly to stellar evolution\nin the early stage, where the temperature of proto-stars or the so called\npre-main sequence stars (T Tauri stars, for example), is at a relatively low of\nseveral million degrees Kelvin. An order-of-magnitude calculation was made on\nthe proton-deuteron fusion rate in young star objects. The estimated x-ray\nluminosity from this reaction is found enough in magnitude to account for\nexperimental ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2009 16:24:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-21"}

Under this framework we investigate the\nevolving galaxy population by comparing key observations at both low and\nhigh-redshifts, finding generally good agreement. By analysing the evolutionary\nproperties of this model, we are able to recreate several features of the\nevolving galaxy population with redshift, naturally reproducing number counts\nof massive star-forming galaxies at high redshifts, along with the galaxy\nscaling relations, star formation rate density and evolution of the stellar\nmass function. Building upon these encouraging agreements, we make model\npredictions that can be tested by future observations.

Also, the characteristic transition mass from disc to bulge\ndominated system should decrease with increasing redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2009 17:08:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2009 19:27:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

Young stars are likely to have much stronger stellar winds\nthan the Sun, and because planetary magnetospheric emissions are powered by\nstellar winds, stronger stellar winds may enhance the radio luminosity of any\norbiting planets. Using various stellar catalogs, we selected nearby stars (<~\n30 pc) with relatively young age estimates (< 3 Gyr). We constructed different\nsamples from the stellar catalogs, finding between 100 and several hundred\nstars. We stacked images from the 74-MHz (4-m wavelength) VLA Low-frequency Sky\nSurvey (VLSS), obtaining 3\\sigma limits on planetary emission in the stacked\nimages of between 10 and 33 mJy. These flux density limits correspond to\naverage planetary luminosities less than 5--10 x 10^{23} erg/s. Using recent\nmodels for the scaling of stellar wind velocity, density, and magnetic field\nwith stellar age, we estimate scaling factors for the strength of stellar\nwinds, relative to the Sun, in our samples. The typical kinetic energy carried\nby the stellar winds in our samples is 15--50 times larger than that of the\nSun, and the typical magnetic energy is 5--10 times larger. If we assume that\nevery star is orbited by a Jupiter-like planet with a luminosity larger than\nthat of the Jovian decametric radiation by the above factors, our limits on\nplanetary luminosities from the stacking analysis are likely to be a factor of\n10--100 above what would be required to detect the planets in a statistical\nsense.

We\nare able to show unequivocally that the most common relativistic iron lines in\nthe universe will be produced by neutral iron fluorescence in Seyfert galaxies\nand have equivalent widths < 100 eV. Thus, the handful of very intense lines\nthat have been discovered are just the bright end of a distribution of line\nstrengths. In addition to validating the current observations, the predicted\ndistributions can be used for planning future surveys of relativistic Fe lines.\nFinally, the predicted sky density of equivalent widths indicate that the X-ray\nsource in AGNs can not, on average, lie on the axis of the black hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2009 20:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The degree of asymmetry depends on the amplitude of SASI, which\nnonlinear saturation mechanism has never been elucidated. We investigate the\nrole of parasitic instabilities as a possible cause of nonlinear SASI\nsaturation. As the shock oscillations create both vorticity and entropy\ngradients, we show that both Kelvin-Helmholtz and Rayleigh-Taylor types of\ninstabilities are able to grow on a SASI mode if its amplitude is large enough.\nWe obtain simple estimates of their growth rates, taking into account the\neffects of advection and entropy stratification. In the context of the\nadvective-acoustic cycle, we use numerical simulations to demonstrate how the\nacoustic feedback can be decreased if a parasitic instability distorts the\nadvected structure. The amplitude of the shock deformation is estimated\nanalytically in this scenario. When applied to the set up of Fernandez &\nThompson (2009a), this saturation mechanism is able to explain the dramatic\ndecrease of the SASI power when both the nuclear dissociation energy and the\ncooling rate are varied.

The scheme couples an explicit fluctuating compressible Navier-Stokes\nsolver with the Isotropic Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) particle method\n[A. Donev and A. L. Garcia and B. J. Alder, ArXiv preprint 0908.0510]. To\nachieve bidirectional dynamic coupling between the particle (microscale) and\ncontinuum (macroscale) regions, the continuum solver provides state-based\nboundary conditions to the particle subdomain, while the particle solver\nprovides flux-based boundary conditions for the continuum subdomain. The\nequilibrium diffusive (Brownian) motion of a large spherical bead suspended in\na particle fluid is examined, demonstrating that the hybrid method correctly\nreproduces the velocity autocorrelation function of the bead but only if\nthermal fluctuations are included in the continuum solver. Finally, the hybrid\nis applied to the well-known adiabatic piston problem and it is found that the\nhybrid correctly reproduces the slow non-equilibrium relaxation of the piston\ntoward thermodynamic equilibrium but, again, only the continuum solver includes\nstochastic (white-noise) flux terms. These examples clearly demonstrate the\nneed to include fluctuations in continuum solvers employed in hybrid multiscale\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2009 21:37:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

All channels are assumed to be\nblock Rayleigh fading with shadowing, described by parameters\n$(\\alpha,\\varpi)$, where $\\alpha$ denotes the probability of shadowing and\n$\\varpi$ represents the average cross-link gains. The analysis relies on the\ndistributed on-off power allocation strategy (i.e., links with a direct channel\ngain above a certain threshold transmit at full power and the rest remain\nsilent) for the deterministic and stochastic packet arrival processes. It is\nalso assumed that each transmitter has a buffer size of one packet and dropping\noccurs once a packet arrives in the buffer while the previous packet has not\nbeen served. In the first part of the paper, we define a new notion of\nperformance in the network, called effective throughput, which captures the\neffect of arrival process in the network throughput, and maximize it for\ndifferent cases of packet arrival process.

Regarding the former, while the\nobserved detection rate at small angular diameter distance ratios is a near\ncertainty, for an unbiased sample, where either a detection or a non-detection\nare equally likely, at ratios > 0.8 the observed detection rate has an 8 sigma\nsignificance, suggesting that the mix of ratios values at z < 1 is correlated\nwith the mix of detections and non-detections at low redshift, while the\nexclusively high values of the ratio at z > 1 contribute to the low detection\nrates at high redshift.

The majority of stars that leave the main sequence are undergoing\nextensive mass loss, in particular during the asymptotic giant branch (AGB)\nphase of evolution. Observations show that the rate at which this phenomenon\ndevelops differs highly from source to source, so that the time-integrated mass\nloss as a function of the initial conditions (mass, metallicity, etc.) and of\nthe stage of evolution is presently not well understood. Aims. We are\ninvestigating the mass loss history of AGB stars by observing the molecular and\natomic emissions of their circumstellar envelopes. Methods. In this work we\nhave selected two stars that are on the thermally pulsing phase of the AGB\n(TP-AGB) and for which high quality data in the CO rotation lines and in the\natomic hydrogen line at 21 cm could be obained. Results. V1942 Sgr, a carbon\nstar of the Irregular variability type, shows a complex CO line profile that\nmay originate from a long-lived wind at a rate of ~ 10^-7 Msol/yr, and from a\nyoung (< 10^4 years) fast outflow at a rate of ~ 5 10^-7 Msol/yr. Intense HI\nemission indicates a detached shell with 0.044 Msol of hydrogen. This shell\nprobably results from the slowing-down, by surrounding matter, of the same\nlong-lived wind observed in CO that has been active during ~ 6 10^5 years. On\nthe other hand, the carbon Mira V CrB is presently undergoing mass loss at a\nrate of 2 10^-7 Msol/yr, but was not detected in HI. The wind is mostly\nmolecular, and was active for at most 3 10^4 years, with an integrated mass\nloss of at most 6.5 10^-3 Msol. Conclusions. Although both sources are carbon\nstars on the TP-AGB, they appear to develop mass loss under very different\nconditions, and a high rate of mass loss may not imply a high integrated mass\nloss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2009 08:59:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

We compute two 3D hydrodynamical simulations representative --\nin effective temperature and gravity -- of the surface layers of the CoRoT\ntarget HD 49933, a star that is rather metal poor and significantly hotter\ncompared to the Sun. One 3D simulation has a solar metal abundance and the\nother has a surface iron-to-hydrogen, [Fe/H], abundance ten times smaller. For\neach 3D simulation we match an associated global 1D model and we compute the\nassociated acoustic modes using a theoretical model of stochastic excitation\nvalidated in the case of the Sun and Alpha Cen A. The rate at which energy is\nsupplied per unit time into the acoustic modes associated with the 3D\nsimulation with [Fe/H]=-1 are found about three times smaller than those\nassociated with the 3D simulation with [Fe/H]=0. As shown here, these\ndifferences are related to the fact that low metallicity implies surface layers\nwith a higher mean density.

A new\nmethod, which is based on the geometric representations of linear\ntransformations, is proposed to find solutions. The method uses the fact that a\nvector of fuzzy triangular numbers forms a rectangular prism in n-dimensional\nspace and that the image of a parallelepiped is also a parallelepiped under a\nlinear transformation. The suggested method clarifies why in general case\ndifferent approaches do not generate solutions as fuzzy numbers. It is\ngeometrically proved that if the coefficient matrix is a generalized\npermutation matrix, then the solution of a fuzzy linear system (FLS) is a\nvector of fuzzy numbers irrespective of the vector on the right-hand side. The\nmost important difference between this and previous papers on FLS is that the\nsolution is sought as a fuzzy set of vectors (with real components) rather than\na vector of fuzzy numbers. Each vector in the solution set solves the given FLS\nwith a certain possibility. The suggested method can also be applied in the\ncase when the right-hand side is a vector of fuzzy numbers in parametric form.\nHowever, in this case, -cuts of the solution can not be determined by geometric\nsimilarity and additional computations are needed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2009 11:20:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2011 08:06:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-03"}

The point at issue, is\nthat the reasoning which leads to a removal of the unphysical excitation modes\nis valid in both phases of the theory - i.e. both after and before the phase\ntransition occurs. Consistently removing unphysical degrees of freedom implies\na discrepancy in the number of physical degrees of freedom.

There are two types of oscillatory phenomena observed\nin prominences; \"small amplitude oscillations\" (~2-3 km s$^{-1}$) which are\nquite common and \"large amplitude oscillations\" ($>$20 km s$^{-1}$) for which\nobservations are scarce. Large amplitude oscillations have been found as\n\"winking filament\" in H$\\alpha$ as well as motion in the sky plane in\nH$\\alpha$, EUV, micro-wave and He 10830 observations. Historically, it was\nsuggested that the large amplitude oscillations in prominences were triggered\nby disturbances such as fast-mode MHD waves (Moreton wave) produced by remote\nflares. Recent observations show, in addition, that near-by flares or jets can\nalso create such large amplitude oscillations in prominences. Large amplitude\noscillations, which are observed both in transverse as well as longitudinal\ndirection, have a range of periods varying from tens of minutes to a couple of\nhours. Using the observed period of oscillation and simple theoretical models,\nthe obtained magnetic field in prominences has shown quite a good agreement\nwith directly measured one and therefore, justifies prominences seismology as a\npowerful diagnostic tool.

Our algorithm has been made\npublicly available as the program LEV1ATHAN. It combines ideas from several\nknown theoretical algorithms for phylogenetic tree and network reconstruction\nwith two novel subroutines. Namely, an exponential-time exact and a greedy\nalgorithm both of which are of independent theoretical interest. Most\nimportantly, LEV1ATHAN runs in polynomial time and always constructs a level-1\nnetwork. If the data is consistent with a phylogenetic tree, then the algorithm\nconstructs such a tree. Moreover, if the input triplet set is dense and, in\naddition, is fully consistent with some level-1 network, it will find such a\nnetwork. The potential of LEV1ATHAN is explored by means of an extensive\nsimulation study and a biological data set. One of our conclusions is that\nLEV1ATHAN is able to construct networks consistent with a high percentage of\ninput triplets, even when these input triplets are affected by a low to\nmoderate level of noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2009 12:17:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

Our goal is to\ndetermine which core properties can be robustly identified and which depend on\nthe extraction technique. Four regions in the cloud are examined: NGC1333,\nIC348/HH211, L1448 and L1455. We identify clumps of dust emission using two\npopular automated algorithms, CLFIND and GAUSSCLUMPS, finding 85 and 122 clumps\nin total respectively. Some trends are true for both populations: clumps become\nincreasingly elongated over time and are consistent with constant surface\nbrightness objects, with an average brightness ~4 to 10 times larger than the\nsurrounding molecular cloud; the clump mass distribution (CMD) resembles the\nstellar intial mass function, with a slope alpha = -2.0+/-0.1 for CLFIND and\nalpha = -3.15+/-0.08 for GAUSSCLUMPS, which straddle the Salpeter value. The\nmass at which the slope shallows (similar for both algorithms at M~6 Msun)\nimplies a star-forming efficiency of between 10 and 20 per cent. Other trends\nreported elsewhere depend on the clump-finding technique: we find protostellar\nclumps are both smaller (for GAUSSCLUMPS) and larger (for CLFIND) than their\nstarless counterparts; the functional form, best-fitting to the CMD, is\ndifferent for the two algorithms. The GAUSSCLUMPS CMD is best-fitted with a\nlog-normal distribution, whereas a broken power law is best for CLFIND; the\nreported lack of massive starless cores in previous studies can be seen in the\nCLFIND but not the GAUSSCLUMPS data. Our approach highlights similarities and\ndifferences between the clump populations, illustrating the caution that must\nbe exercised when comparing results from different studies and interpreting the\nproperties of continuum cores.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2009 15:17:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

We use observations of galaxies and SNe Ia within\nthe Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS) to measure the relation\nbetween galaxy luminosity and dark matter halo mass. The relation we\ninvestigate is a scaling law between velocity dispersion and galaxy luminosity\nin the B-band.

The aim of\nthis survey is to investigate the origin of radio emission in early-type\ngalaxies and its link with the host properties in an unexplored territory\ntoward the lowest levels of both radio and optical luminosities. Radio images,\navailable for all 63 galaxies with BT < 14.4, show the presence of a compact\nradio source in 12 objects, with fluxes spanning from 0.13 to 2700 mJy. The\nremaining 51 galaxies, undetected at a flux limit of ~0.1 mJy, have radio\nluminosities L < 4 10E18 W/Hz . The fraction of radio-detected galaxies are a\nstrong function of stellar mass, in agreement with previous results: none of\nthe 30 galaxies with stellar mass M(star) < 1.7 10E10 M(sun) is detected, while\n8 of the 11 most massive galaxies have radio cores. There appears to be no\nsimple relation between the presence of a stellar nucleus and radio emission. A\nmultiwavelength analysis of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) emission,\ncombining radio and X-ray data, confirms the link between optical surface\nbrightness profile and radio loudness in the sense that the bright core\ngalaxies are associated with radio-loud AGNs, while non-core galaxies host\nradio-quiet AGNs. Not all radio-detected galaxies have a X-ray nuclear counter\npart (and vice-versa). A complete census of AGNs (and supermassive black holes,\nSMBHs) thus requires observations, at least, in both bands. Nonetheless, there\nare massive galaxies in the sample, expected to host a large SMBH (M(BH) ~ 10E8\nM(sun)), whose nuclear emission eludes detection despite their proximity and\nthe depth and the spatial resolution of the available observations.

The improved\nscheme includes both the Schottky barrier lowering due to the individual image\ncharge and the barrier change due to the field penetration into the injecting\nelectrode that ensures validity of the model at both high and low injection\nrates including the barrier dominated and the space-charge dominated regimes.\nComparison of the theory with experiment on an unipolar ITO/PPV/Au-device is\npresented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2009 15:51:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2009 11:01:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2010 14:05:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-11"}
