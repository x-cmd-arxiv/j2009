A key step of the algorithm is to take a wavelet-Galerkin\ndiscretization of the differential relation between the $E$, $B$ and $Q$, $U$\nfields. This discretization allows derivative operator to be represented by a\nmatrix, which is exactly diagonal in scale space, and narrowly banded in\nspatial space. We show that the effect of boundary can be eliminated by\ndropping a few DWT modes located on or nearby the boundary. This method reveals\nthat the derivative operators will cause large errors in the $E$ and $B$ power\nspectra on small scales if the $Q$ and $U$ maps contain Gaussian noise. It also\nreveals that if the $Q$ and $U$ maps are random, these fields lead to the\nmixing of the $E$ and $B$ modes. Consequently, the $B$ mode will be\ncontaminated if the powers of $E$ modes are much larger than that of $B$ modes.\nNevertheless, numerical tests show that the power spectra of both $E$ and $B$\non scales larger than the finest scale by a factor of 4 and higher can\nreasonably be recovered, even when the power ratio of $E$- to $B$-modes is as\nlarge as about 10$^2$, and the signal-to-noise ratio is equal to 10 and higher.\nThis is because the Galerkin discretization is free of false correlations, and\nkeeps the contamination under control. As wavelet variables contain information\nof both spatial and scale spaces, the developed method is also effective to\nrecover the spatial structures of the $E$ and $B$ mode fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Oct 2009 01:45:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

It hosts the \\emph{Large\nArea Telescope} (LAT), sensitive to $\\gamma$-ray photons from 20 MeV to over\n300 GeV. When the LAT began its activity, nine young and energetic pulsars were\nknown in $\\gamma$ rays. At least several tens of pulsar detections by the LAT\nwere predicted before launch. The LAT also allowed the study of millisecond\npulsars (MSPs), never firmly detected in $\\gamma$ rays before Fermi.\n  This thesis first presents the pulsar timing campaign for the LAT, in\ncollaboration with large radiotelescopes and X-ray telescopes, allowing for\nhigh sensitivity pulsed searches. Furthermore, it lead to quasi-homogeneous\ncoverage of the galactic MSPs, so that the search for pulsations in LAT data\nfor this population of stars was not affected by an \\emph{a priori} bias.\n  We present a search for pulsations from these objects in LAT data. For the\nfirst time, eight galactic MSPs have been detected as sources of pulsed\n$\\gamma$-ray emission over 100 MeV. In addition, a couple of good candidates\nfor future detection are seen. A similar search for globular cluster MSPs has\nnot succeeded so far. Comparison of the phase-aligned $\\gamma$-ray and radio\nlight curves, as well as the spectral shapes, leads to the conclusion that\ntheir $\\gamma$-ray emission is similar to that of normal pulsars, and is\nprobably produced in the outer-magnetosphere. This discovery suggests that many\nunresolved $\\gamma$-ray sources are unknown MSPs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Oct 2009 06:05:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-27"}

For an\naxisymmetric planetesimal disk with common pericentres and eccentricities e, we\nfind that M_{late} \\propto e^{-5/3}(1+e)^{4/3}(1-e)^{-3}. For a scattered\ndisk-like population (i.e., common pericentres), in the absence of dynamical\nevolution, the mass evolution at late times would be as if only planetesimals\nwith the largest eccentricity were present. Despite the increased remaining\nmass, higher eccentricities do not increase the hot emission from the\ncollisional cascade until e>0.99, partly because most collisions occur near\npericentre thus increasing the dust blow-out diameter. However, at high\neccentricities (e>0.97) the blow-out population extending out from pericentre\nmay be detectable above the collisional cascade; higher eccentricities also\nincrease the probability of witnessing a recent collision. All of the imaging\nand spectroscopic constraints for eta Corvi can be explained with a single\nplanetesimal population with pericentre at 0.75AU, apocentre at 150AU, and mass\n5M_\\oplus; however, the origin of such a high eccentricity population remains\nchallenging. The mid-IR excess to HD69830 can be explained by the ongoing\ndestruction of a debris belt produced in a recent collision in an eccentric\nplanetesimal belt, but the lack of far-IR emission requires small bound grains\nto be absent from the parent planetesimal belt, possibly due to sublimation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Oct 2009 12:43:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Our own time-dependent, self-similar\nsolutions describing a dynamical condensing radiative gas layer are used as an\nunperturbed state. We consider perturbations that are both perpendicular and\nparallel to the direction of condensation. The transverse wave number of the\nperturbation is defined by $k$. For $k=0$, it is found that the condensing gas\nlayer is unstable. However, the growth rate is too low to become nonlinear\nduring dynamical condensation. For $k\\ne0$, in general, perturbation equations\nfor constant wave number cannot be reduced to an eigenvalue problem due to the\nunsteady unperturbed state. Therefore, direct numerical integration of the\nperturbation equations is performed. For comparison, an eigenvalue problem\nneglecting the time evolution of the unperturbed state is also solved and both\nresults agree well. The gas layer is unstable for all wave numbers, and the\ngrowth rate depends a little on wave number. The behaviour of the perturbation\nis specified by $kL_\\mathrm{cool}$ at the centre, where the cooling length,\n$L_\\mathrm{cool}$, represents the length that a sound wave can travel during\nthe cooling time. For $kL_\\mathrm{cool}\\gg1$, the perturbation grows\nisobarically.\n  For $kL_\\mathrm{cool}\\ll1$, the perturbation grows because each part has a\ndifferent collapse time without interaction. Since the growth rate is\nsufficiently high, it is not long before the perturbations become nonlinear\nduring the dynamical condensation. Therefore, according to the linear analysis,\nthe cooling layer is expected to split into fragments with various scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Oct 2009 12:59:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

They provide systematic guidelines for designing abstract\nsemantic functions that approximate some concrete system behaviors under\nanalysis. It may happen that an abstract domain contains redundant information\nfor the specific purpose of approximating a given concrete semantic function.\nThis paper introduces the notion of correctness kernel of abstract\ninterpretations, a methodology for simplifying abstract domains, i.e. removing\nabstract values from them, in a maximal way while retaining exactly the same\napproximate behavior of the system under analysis. We show that in abstract\nmodel checking correctness kernels provide a simplification paradigm of the\nabstract state space that is guided by examples, meaning that this\nsimplification preserves spuriousness of examples (i.e., abstract paths). In\nparticular, we show how correctness kernels can be integrated with the\nwell-known CEGAR (CounterExample-Guided Abstraction Refinement) methodology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Oct 2009 15:05:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2011 13:21:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 19 Apr 2013 08:29:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-22"}

Due to weak attenuation of oxygen and other\ngaseous atmospheric constituents in this region, we have only considered the\neffect of ozone in calculation. The results are important to estimate\nsystematic errors in measuring gas concentration introduced by large wavelength\nseparation in UV-DIAL. The total attenuation (km-1) at wavelengths is listed in\nthe form of a table from 200 to 400 nm for several values of visibilities. It\nis found the aerosol attenuation in UV region varies quite smoothly with\nwavelength and therefore systematic error caused by aerosol scattering is\nnegligible in remote sensing by UV-DIAL even with large wavelength separation.\nMoreover, it has been found that only aerosol extinction is dominant in lidar\nremote sensing in the lower atmosphere in UV region. In large altitude that\naerosol concentration is lower; the molecular scattering is important\nespecially for wavelengths larger than 310 nm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Oct 2009 15:30:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2011 18:37:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-18"}
