Detailed abundance studies\nof bulge stars is a key to investigate the origin, history, and classification\nof the bulge. The aim is to add to the discussion on the origin of the bulge\nand to study detailed abundances determined from near-IR spectra for bulge\ngiants already investigated with optical spectra, the latter also providing the\nstellar parameters which are very significant for the results of the present\nstudy. Especially, the important CNO elements are better determined in the\nnear-IR. High-resolution, near-infrared spectra in the H band are recorded\nusing the CRIRES spectrometer on the Very Large Telescope. The CNO abundances\ncan all be determined from the numerous molecular lines in the wavelength range\nobserved. Abundances of the alpha elements are also determined from the near-IR\nspectra. [O/Fe], [Si/Fe] and [S/Fe] are enhanced up to metallicities of at\nleast [Fe/H]=-0.3, after which they decline. This suggests that the Milky Way\nbulge experienced a rapid and early star-formation history like that of a\nclassical bulge. However, a similarity between the bulge trend and the trend of\nthe local thick disk seems present. Such a similarity could suggest that the\nbulge has a pseudobulge origin. Our [C/Fe] trend does not show any increase\nwith [Fe/H] which could have been expected if W-R stars have contributed\nsubstantially to the C abundances. No \"cosmic scatter\" can be traced around our\nobserved abundance trends; the scatter found is expected, given the\nobservational uncertainties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 2009 19:41:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

We apply these ideas to the Sculptor and Carina dwarf\nspheroidals.

Normal galaxies with low star-formation rates become radio-faint at high z,\nbecause Inverse Compton (IC) losses off the CMB cool CR electrons and positrons\nrapidly, suppressing their nonthermal radio emission. However, we find that\nthis effect occurs at higher redshifts than previously expected, because\nescape, bremsstrahlung, ionization, and starlight IC losses act to counter this\neffect and preserve the radio luminosity of galaxies. The radio dimming of\nstar-forming galaxies at high z is not just a simple competition between\nmagnetic field energy density and the CMB energy density; the CMB must also\ncompete with every other loss process. We predict relations for the critical\nredshift when radio emission is significantly suppressed compared to the z ~ 0\nFRC as a function of star-formation rate per unit area. Additionally, we\nprovide a quantitative explanation for the relative radio brightness of some\nhigh-z submillimeter galaxies. We show that at fixed star formation rate\nsurface density, galaxies with larger CR scale heights are radio bright with\nrespect to the FRC, because of weaker bremsstrahlung and ionization losses\ncompared to compact starbursts. We predict that these \"puffy starbursts\" should\nhave steeper radio spectra than compact galaxies with the same star-formation\nrate surface density.

Model-based specifications of a component-based system permit to\nexplicitly model the structure and behaviour of components and their\nintegration. In particular Software Architectures (SA) has been advocated as an\neffective means to produce quality systems. In this chapter by combining\ndifferent technologies and tools for analysis and development, we propose an\narchitecture-centric model-driven approach to validate required properties and\nto generate the system code. Functional requirements are elicited and used for\nidentifying expected properties the architecture shall express. The\narchitectural compliance to the properties is formally demonstrated, and the\nproduced architectural model is used to automatically generate the Java code.\nSuitable transformations assure that the code is conforming to both structural\nand behavioural SA constraints. This chapter describes the process and\ndiscusses how some existing tools and languages can be exploited to support the\napproach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 2009 21:57:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-06"}

Extended objects\nthat have prominent emission in IRAC channel 2 (4.5 micron) compared to IRAC\nchannel 1 (3.6 micron) and stand out as green objects in the three-color images\n(3.6 micron in blue, 4.5 micron in green, 8.0 micron in red) are identified as\nmid-infrared outflows. As a result, we detected 13 new outflows in the rho\nOphiuchi molecular cloud that have not been previously observed in optical or\nnear-infrared. In addition, at the positions of previously observed HH objects\nor near-infrared emission, we detected 31 mid-infrared outflows, among which\nseven correspond to previously observed HH objects and 30 to near-infrared\nemission. Most of the mid-infrared outflows detected in the rho Ophiuchi cloud\nare concentrated in the L1688 dense core region. In combination with the survey\nresults for Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) and millimeter and sub-millimeter\nsources, the distribution of mid-infrared outflows in the rho Ophiuchi\nmolecular complex hints a propagation of star formation in the cloud in the\ndirection from the northwest to the southeast as suggested by previous studies\nof the region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Oct 2009 12:47:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2009 13:22:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The validity of the steady-state\napproximation in the rate equations has recently been questioned. We calculate\nthe effective recombination time of hydrogen in SN II using our general purpose\nmodel atmosphere code PHOENIX. While we find that the recombination time for\nthe conditions of SNe II at early times is increased over the classical value\nfor the case of a simple hydrogen model atom with energy levels corresponding\nto just the first 2 principle quantum numbers, the classical value of the\nrecombination time is recovered in the case of a multi-level hydrogen atom. We\nalso find that the recombination time at most optical depths is smaller in the\ncase of a multi-level atom than for a simple two-level hydrogen atom. We find\nthat time dependence in the rate equations is important in the early epochs of\na supernova's lifetime. The changes due to the time dependent rate equation (at\nconstant input luminosity) are manifested in physical parameters such as the\nlevel populations which directly affects the spectra. The H-alpha profile is\naffected by the time dependent rate equations at early times. At later times\ntime dependence does not significantly modify the level populations and\ntherefore the H-alpha profile is roughly independent of whether the\nsteady-state or time-dependent approach is used.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Oct 2009 15:28:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}
