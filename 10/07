The WFC3/IR depth and spatial resolution allow\naccurate removal of contaminating foreground light, enabling reliable flux\nmeasurements at 3.6 micron and 4.5 micron. None of the galaxies are detected to\n[3.6]=26.9 (AB, 2 sigma), but a stacking analysis reveals a robust detection\nfor the z_{850}-dropouts and an upper limit for the Y_{105}-dropouts. We\nconstruct average broadband SEDs using the stacked ACS, WFC3, and IRAC fluxes\nand fit stellar population synthesis models to derive mean redshifts, stellar\nmasses, and ages. For the z_{850}-dropouts, we find z=6.9^{+0.1}_{-0.1},\n(U-V)_{rest}=0.4, reddening A_V=0, stellar mass M*=1.2^{+0.3}_{-0.6} x 10^9\nM_sun (Salpeter IMF).

The sub-L* galaxies\nobserved here contribute significantly to the stellar mass density and under\nfavorable conditions may have provided enough photons for sustained\nreionization at 7<z<11. In contrast, the z=8.3^{+0.1}_{-0.2} Y_{105}-dropouts\nhave stellar masses that are uncertain by 1.5 dex due to the near-complete\nreliance on far-UV data.

This problem naturally arises in\nseveral settings such as ranked elections, multi-object tracking, ranking\nsystems, and recommendation systems. Inspired by the work of Donoho and Stark\nin the context of discrete-time functions, we focus on non-negative functions\nwith a sparse support (support size $\\ll$ domain size). Our recovery method is\nbased on finding the sparsest solution (through $\\ell_0$ optimization) that is\nconsistent with the available information. As the main result, we derive\nsufficient conditions for functions that can be recovered exactly from partial\ninformation through $\\ell_0$ optimization. Under a natural random model for the\ngeneration of functions, we quantify the recoverability conditions by deriving\nbounds on the sparsity (support size) for which the function satisfies the\nsufficient conditions with a high probability as $n \\to \\infty$. $\\ell_0$\noptimization is computationally hard. Therefore, the popular compressive\nsensing literature considers solving the convex relaxation, $\\ell_1$\noptimization, to find the sparsest solution. However, we show that $\\ell_1$\noptimization fails to recover a function (even with constant sparsity)\ngenerated using the random model with a high probability as $n \\to \\infty$. In\norder to overcome this problem, we propose a novel iterative algorithm for the\nrecovery of functions that satisfy the sufficient conditions.

The\ncalculation is essentially a renormalization of the homogeneous (zero order)\ndispersion by fluctuations 1st order in the initial power spectrum. For power\nlaw power spectra with n>-3, the small-scale fluctuations diverge and\nsignificant dispersion can be generated from an arbitrarily small starting\nvalue -- the dispersion level is set by an equilibrium between fluctuations\ngenerating more dispersion and dispersion suppressing fluctuations.

The latter has recently been determined\nwithin the interacting instanton liquid model (IILM), and provides for the\nfirst time a well-motivated axion mass for all temperatures. We reexamine the\nconstraints placed on the axion parameter space in the light of this new mass\nfunction. We find an accurate and updated constraint $ f_a \\le 2.8(\\pm2)\\times\n10^{11}\\units{GeV}$ or $m_a \\ge 21(\\pm2) \\units{\\mu eV}$ from the misalignment\nmechanism in the classic axion window (thermal scenario).

We solve the evolution equations exactly, and find that\nanalytic results used to date generally underestimate the full numerical\nsolution by a factor 2-3.

Considering the fine-tuning issue of the\nmisalignment angle in the whole of the anthropic window, we derive new bounds\nwhich open up the inflationary window near $\\theta_a \\to \\pi$.

The analysis\nwas undertaken by calibrating Lee 2525 with respect to the standard giant star\nArcturus. This work emphasises the importance of using a standard star with\nstellar parameters comparable to the star under analysis rather than a\ncalibration with respect to the Sun (Koch & McWilliam 2008). Systematic errors\nin the analysis process are then minimised due to the similarity in atmospheric\nstructure between the standard and programme stars. The abundances derived for\nLee 2525 were found to be in general agreement with the Brown & Wallerstein\n(1992) values except for Zr. In this study Zr has a similar enhancement\n([Zr/Fe] = +0.51 dex) to another light s-process element, Y ([Y/Fe] = +0.53\ndex), which reflects current theory regarding the enrichment of s-process\nelements by nuclear processes within AGB stars (Busso et al. 2001). This is\ncontrary to the results of Brown & Wallerstein (1992) where Zr was\nunder-abundant ([Zr/Fe] = +0.51 dex) and Y was over-abundant ([Y/Fe] = +0.50\ndex) with respect to Fe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2009 20:32:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Two model-dependent explanations for the changes in Fe line profile are\nexplored.

Our studies of magnetic field diffusion in turbulent\nmedium reveal interesting new phenomena. In the presence of gravity and\nturbulence, our 3D simulations show the decrease of the magnetic flux-to-mass\nratio as the gaseous density at the center of the gravitational potential\nincreases. We observe this effect both in the situations when we start with\nequilibrium distributions of gas and magnetic field and when we follow the\nevolution of collapsing dynamically unstable configurations. Thus the process\nof turbulent magnetic field removal should be applicable both to quasi-static\nsubcritical molecular clouds and cores and violently collapsing supercritical\nentities. The increase of the gravitational potential as well as the\nmagnetization of the gas increases the segregation of the mass and magnetic\nflux in the saturated final state of the simulations, supporting the notion\nthat the reconnection-enabled diffusivity relaxes the magnetic field + gas\nsystem in the gravitational field to its minimal energy state.

This fills a long-standing gap in the literature where the\ndimensionality is allowed to grow slowly with the sample size. Our results are\nalso applicable to penalized likelihood with the $L_1$-penalty, which is a\nconvex function at the boundary of the class of folded-concave penalty\nfunctions under consideration. The coordinate optimization is implemented for\nfinding the solution paths, whose performance is evaluated by a few simulation\nexamples and the real data analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2009 21:32:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-08"}

Consequently, the astrometric quality of the new infrared camera,\nFanCam, developed by the Virginia Astronomical Instrumentation Laboratory\n(VAIL) for the 31-in (0.8-m) Tinsley reflector at Fan Mountain Observatory was\nassessed using 68 J-band exposures of an open cluster, NGC 2420, over a range\nof hour angles during 2005. Positions of 16 astrometric evaluation stars were\nmeasured and the repeatability of those positions was evaluated using the mean\nerror in a single observation of unit weight. Overall, a precision of 1.3 +/-\n0.7 microns in x (RA) and 1.3 +/- 0.8 microns in y (Dec) was attained, which\ncorresponds to 0.04\" +/- 0.02\" in each axis. Although greater precision is\nexpected from CCDs in the visual and near-infrared, this instrument can achieve\nprecision similar to that of the ESO NTT infrared parallax program. Therefore,\nmeasuring parallaxes in the infrared would be feasible using this equipment. If\ninitiated, such a program could provide essential distances for brown dwarfs\nand very low mass stars that would contribute significantly to the solar\nneighborhood census.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2009 14:25:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2009 23:57:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 7 Apr 2010 19:56:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

This study is stimulated by claims that\nthe observed magnitude and temperature dependence of kinetic isotope effects\nimply that quantum tunneling below the energy barrier associated with the\ntransition state significantly enhances the reaction rate in many enzymes. We\nuse a path integral approach which provides a general framework to understand\ntunneling in a quantum system which interacts with an environment at non-zero\ntemperature. Here the quantum system is the active site of the enzyme and the\nenvironment is the surrounding protein and water. Tunneling well below the\nbarrier only occurs for temperatures less than a temperature $T_0$ which is\ndetermined by the curvature of potential energy surface near the top of the\nbarrier. We argue that for most enzymes this temperature is less than room\ntemperature. For physically reasonable parameters quantum transition state\ntheory gives a quantitative description of the temperature dependence and\nmagnitude of kinetic isotope effects for two classes of enzymes which have been\nclaimed to exhibit signatures of quantum tunneling. The only quantum effects\nare those associated with the transition state, both reflection at the barrier\ntop and tunneling just below the barrier. We establish that the friction due to\nthe environment is weak and only slightly modifies the reaction rate.\nFurthermore, at room temperature and for typical energy barriers environmental\ndegrees of freedom with frequencies much less than 1000 cm$^{-1}$ do not have a\nsignificant effect on quantum corrections to the reaction rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2009 03:34:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-25"}

We introduce a\nconstrained optimization algorithm that jointly segments aCGH profiles of many\nsubjects.

Instead, such a field describes a nonsingular particle whose spatial\ndimension is at least on the order of its Cartan radius. In particular, torsion\nmodifies Burinskii's model of the Dirac electron as a Kerr-Newman singular ring\nof the Compton size, by replacing the ring with a toroidal structure with the\nouter radius of the Compton size and the inner radius of the Cartan size. We\nconjecture that torsion produced by spin prevents the formation of\nsingularities from matter composed of quarks and leptons. We expect that the\nCartan radius of an electron, ~10^{-27} m, introduces an effective ultraviolet\ncutoff in quantum field theory for fermions in the ECKS spacetime.

It has been suggested that part of its\nemission arises from the interaction between a LBG and two EROs at z~2.9 that\nare multiply-imaged. However, the dramatic resolution difference between the\nsub-mm map and the optical/NIR images make it difficult to confirm this\nhypothesis. In this paper, we present a deep (~ 10 microJy/beam), high\nresolution (~2 arcsec) 1.4 GHz radio map of the cluster core, in which we have\nidentified 6 sources located within SMM J04542-0301. The strong lensing effect\nin the radio data has been quantified by constructing a new lens model of the\ncluster. The brightest and most extended of these sources (RJ) is located in\nthe middle of the sub-mm emission, and has no obvious counterpart in the\noptical/NIR. Three other detections (E1, E2 and E3) seem to be associated with\nthe images of one of the EROs. The last two detections (CR1 and CR2), for which\nno optical/NIR counterpart have been found, seem to constitute two relatively\ncompact emitting regions embedded in a ~5 arcsec extended radio source located\nat the position of the sub-mm peak. The presence of this extended component can\nonly be explained if it is being produced by a lensed region of dust obscured\nstar formation in the center of the merger. A comparison between the radio and\nsub-mm data at the same resolution suggests that E1, E2, E3, CR1 and CR2 are\nassociated with the sub-mm emission. The radio observations provide strong\nobservational evidence in favor of the merger hypothesis. However, the question\nif RJ is also contributing to the observed sub-mm emission remains open. These\nresults illustrate the promising prospects for radio interferometry and strong\ngravitational lensing to study the internal structure of SMGs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2009 11:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

There is a\nwidespread consensus that line emitting knots observed in Herbig-Haro jets can\nbe interpreted as radiative shocks. In this paper we address two different\naspects relevant to the time-dependent calculations of the line intensity\nratios of forbidden transitions, resulting from the excitation by planar,\ntime-dependent radiative shocks traveling in a stratified medium. The first one\nconcerns the impact of the radiation and ionization processes included in the\ncooling model, and the second one the effects of the numerical grid resolution.\nIn this paper we apply the AMR methodology to the treatment of radiating shocks\nand show how this method is able to vastly reduce the integration time. The\ntechnique is applied to the knots of the HH 30 jet to obtain the observed line\nintensity ratios and derive the physical parameters, such as density,\ntemperature and ionization fraction. We consider the impact of two different\ncooling functions and different grid resolutions on the results. We conclude\nthat the use of different cooling routines has effects on results whose weight\ndepends upon the line ratio considered. Moreover, we find the minimum numerical\nresolution of the simulation grid behind the shock to achieve convergence in\nthe results. This is crucial for the forthcoming 2D calculations of radiative\nshocks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2009 12:03:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-24"}

The modeling features the compositionality,\nmodularity, reuse and strengthens the benefits of Constrained-Based Local\nSearch. We also apply the modeling to the edge-disjoint paths problem (EDP). We\nshow that side constraints can easily be added in the model. Computational\nresults show the significance of the approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2009 12:36:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-08"}

The model that we consider is interacting\nself-avoiding polygons on the simple cubic lattice. For polygons with fixed\nknot type we find a writhe distribution whose average depends on the knot type\nbut is insensitive to the length $N$ of the polygon and to solvent conditions.\nThis \"topological contribution\" to the writhe distribution has a value that is\nconsistent with that of ideal knots. The standard deviation of the writhe\nincreases approximately as $\\sqrt{N}$ in both regimes and this constitutes a\ngeometrical contribution to the writhe. If the sum over all knot types is\nconsidered, the scaling of the standard deviation changes, for compact\npolygons, to $\\sim N^{0.6}$. We argue that this difference between the two\nregimes can be ascribed to the topological contribution to the writhe that, for\ncompact chains, overwhelms the geometrical one thanks to the presence of a\nlarge population of complex knots at relatively small values of $N$. For\npolygons with fixed writhe we find that the knot distribution depends on the\nchosen writhe, with the occurrence of achiral knots being considerably\nsuppressed for large writhe. In general, the occurrence of a given knot thus\ndepends on a nontrivial interplay between writhe, chain length, and solvent\nconditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2009 15:00:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

In the practical case where finite length shaping waveforms are\nused, it is shown that better diversity gains can be achieved at the expense of\nbandwidth expansion. In the decode-and-forward (DF) type protocols, the\nasynchronous network provides better diversity gains than those of the\ncorresponding synchronous network throughout the range of the multiplexing\ngain. In the amplify-and-forward (AF) type protocols, the asynchronous network\nprovides the same DMT as that of the corresponding synchronous counterpart\nunder the OAF protocol; however, a better diversity gain is achieved under the\nNAF protocol throughout the range of the multiplexing gain. In particular, in\nthe single relay asynchronous network, the NAF protocol provides the same DMT\nas that of the 2 {\\times} 1 multiple-input single-output (MISO) channel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2009 15:55:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2011 20:33:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-21"}

Binary\nsystems play a critical role in the evolution of GCs, serving as an internal\nenergy source countering the tendency of GC cores to collapse. Theoretical\nstudies predict dozens of CVs in the cores of some GCs (e.g., 130 for M28, 40\nfor M30). A number of such binaries is also expected outside the core radius.\nHowever, few CVs are known so far in GCs. Using subtraction technique applied\nto images taken with the 4.1-m SOAR telescope we have found 27 objects with\nH-alpha excess in the field of the observed clusters, of which nine are likely\nassociated with the clusters. Four are candidate CVs, four candidate ABs, one\ncould be either a CV or an AB. One H-alpha object seems to be a background\ngalaxy, while other 17 detected objects are probably foreground or background\nstars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2009 15:57:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-08"}
