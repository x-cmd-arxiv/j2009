In this paper, we use a sample of 206 X-ray selected galaxy groups to\ninvestigate the scaling relation between X-ray luminosity (Lx) and halo mass\n(M00) where M200 is derived via stacked weak gravitational lensing. This work\ndraws upon a broad array of multi-wavelength COSMOS observations including 1.64\nsquare degrees of contiguous imaging with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS)\nand deep XMM-Newton/Chandra imaging. The combined depth of these two data-sets\nallows us to probe the lensing signals of X-ray detected structures at both\nhigher redshifts and lower masses than previously explored. Weak lensing\nprofiles and halo masses are derived for nine sub-samples, narrowly binned in\nluminosity and redshift. The COSMOS data alone are well fit by a power law,\nM200 ~ Lx^a, with a slope of a=0.66+-0.14. These results significantly extend\nthe dynamic range for which the halo masses of X-ray selected structures have\nbeen measured with weak gravitational lensing. As a result, tight constraints\nare obtained for the slope of the M-Lx relation. The combination of our group\ndata with previously published cluster data demonstrates that the M-Lx relation\nis well described by a single power law, a=0.64+-0.03, over two decades in\nmass, 10^13.5-10^15.5 h72^-1 Msun. These results are inconsistent at the 3.7\nlevel with the self-similar prediction of a=0.75. We examine the redshift\ndependence of the M-Lx relation and find little evidence for evolution beyond\nthe rate predicted by self-similarity from z ~ 0.25 to z ~ 0.8.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2009 18:47:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2009 22:57:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

The accuracy of photometric\nredshifts was assessed by comparing our estimates with the spectroscopic\nredshifts of ~1400 galaxies in the 0.3<z<1.0 domain. The accuracy for galaxies\nfainter than the spectroscopic control sample was estimated using a degraded\nversion of the photometric catalog for the spectroscopic sample. The accuracy\nof photometric redshifts is typically sigma(Delta z/(1+z)) ~ 0.05+/-0.01,\ndepending on the field, the filter set, and the spectral type of the galaxies.\nThe quality of the photometric redshifts degrades by a factor of two in\nsigma(Delta z/(1+z)) between the brightest (I~22) and the faintest (I~24-24.5)\ngalaxies in the EDisCS sample. The photometric determination of cluster\nredshifts in the EDisCS fields using a simple algorithm based on photoz is in\nexcellent agreement with the spectroscopic values (delta(z) ~0.03-0.04 in the\nhigh-z sample and ~0.05 in the low-z sample). We also developed a method that\nuses both photz codes jointly to reject interlopers at magnitudes fainter than\nthe spectroscopic limit. When applied to the spectroscopic sample, this method\nrejects ~50-90% of all spectroscopically confirmed non-members, while retaining\nat least 90% of all confirmed members. Photometric redshifts are found to be\nparticularly useful for the identification and study of clusters of galaxies in\nlarge surveys. They enable efficient and complete pre-selection of cluster\nmembers for spectroscopy, allow accurate determinations of the cluster\nredshifts, and provide a means of determining cluster membership.

Collectively, these large images will contain billions of\ninteresting objects, which astronomers call sources. The astronomers' task is\nto construct a catalog detailing the coordinates and other properties of the\nsources. The source catalog is the primary data product for most telescopes and\nis an important input for testing new astrophysical theories, but to construct\nthe catalog one must first detect the sources. Existing algorithms for catalog\ncreation are effective at detecting sources, but do not have rigorous\nstatistical error control. At the same time, there are several multiple testing\nprocedures that provide rigorous error control, but they are not designed to\ndetect sources that are aggregated over several pixels. In this paper, we\npropose a technique that does both, by providing rigorous statistical error\ncontrol on the aggregate objects themselves rather than the pixels. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on data from the Chandra X-ray\nObservatory Satellite. Our technique effectively controls the rate of false\nsources, yet still detects almost all of the sources detected by procedures\nthat do not have such rigorous error control and have the advantage of\nadditional data in the form of follow up observations, which will not be\navailable for upcoming large telescopes.

A transition is generally observed from a\ntime-homogeneous dynamical regime to an aging regime where physical changes\noccur intermittently and, on average, at a decreasing rate. It has been\nsuggested that a global change of the independent time variable to its\nlogarithm may render the aging dynamics homogeneous: for colloids, this entails\ndiffusion but on a logarithmic time scale. Our novel analysis of experimental\ncolloid data confirms that the mean square displacement grows linearly in time\nat low densities and shows that it grows linearly in the logarithm of time at\nhigh densities. Correspondingly, pairs of particles initially in close contact\nsurvive as pairs with a probability which decays exponentially in either time\nor its logarithm. The form of the Probability Density Function of the\ndisplacements shows that long-ranged spatial correlations are very long-lived\nin dense colloids. A phenomenological stochastic model is then introduced which\nrelies on the growth and collapse of strongly correlated clusters (\"dynamic\nheterogeneity\"), and which reproduces the full spectrum of observed colloidal\nbehaviors depending on the form assumed for the probability that a cluster\ncollapses during a Monte Carlo update. In the limit where large clusters\ndominate, the collapse rate is ~1/t, implying a homogeneous, log-Poissonian\nprocess that qualitatively reproduces the experimental results for dense\ncolloids. Finally an analytical toy-model is discussed to elucidate the strong\ndependence of the simulation results on the integrability (or lack thereof) of\nthe cluster collapse probability function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2009 19:57:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Jan 2011 05:19:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

How these real-space patterns affect the conductivity and other\nproperties of materials (which are usually described in momentum space) is one\nof the major challenges of modern condensed matter physics. Moreover, although\nthe presence of static stripes is indisputable, the existence (and potential\nimpacts) of fluctuating stripes in such compounds is a subject of great debate.\nHere we present the electronic excitations of\nLa$_{2-2x}$Sr$_{1+2x}$Mn$_{2}$O$_{7}$ (x ~ 0.59) probed by angle-resolved\nphotoemission (ARPES), from which we demonstrate that a novel type of ordering,\ntermed bi-stripes, can exhibit either static or fluctuating order as a function\nof temperature. We found that the static bi-stripe order is especially damaging\nto electrical conductivity, completely localizing the electrons in the\nbi-stripe regions, while the fluctuating stripes can coexist with mobile\ncarriers. This physics drives a novel phase transition with colossal\nconductivity changes as a function of temperature. Our finding suggests that\nquantum stripes can give rise to electronic properties significantly different\nfrom their static counterparts. Inducing transition between them can turn on\nremarkable electronic phenomena, enriching our understanding of correlated\nelectron systems as well as opening a window for potential applications in\nelectronic devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2009 21:35:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 31 Oct 2009 17:54:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Our results indicate variability that is consistent with\nthe binary period, with the emission being modulated with a period of 3.903 +/-\n0.005 days; the first detection of this modulation at GeV energies. The light\ncurve is characterized by a broad peak around superior conjunction in agreement\nwith inverse Compton scattering models. The spectrum is represented by a power\nlaw with an exponential cutoff, yielding an overall flux (100 MeV - 300 GeV) of\n4.9 +/- 0.5(stat) +/- 1.8(syst) x 10^-7 photon cm^-2 s^-1, with a cutoff at 2.1\n+/- 0.3(stat) +/- 1.1(syst) GeV and photon index Gamma = 1.9 +/- 0.1(stat) +/-\n0.3(syst). The spectrum is observed to vary with orbital phase, specifically\nbetween inferior and superior conjunction. We suggest that the presence of a\ncutoff in the spectrum may be indicative of magnetospheric emission similar to\nthe emission seen in many pulsars by Fermi.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2009 23:23:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-27"}

It (1) has been detected in\nemission in type 2 sources, (2) shows broad, flat-topped emission peaks shifted\ntoward long wavelengths in several type 1 sources, and (3) is not seen in deep\nabsorption in any source observed so far. We solve all three puzzles with our\nclumpy dust radiative transfer formalism. (1) We present the spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) of SST1721+6012, the first type 2 quasar observed to show a\nclear 10-mic silicate feature in emission. We constructed a large database of\nclumpy torus models and performed extensive fitting of the observed SED,\nconstraining several of the torus parameters. We find that the source\nbolometric luminosity is ~3*10^12 L_sun. Our modeling suggests that <35% of\nobjects with tori sharing characteristics and geometry similar to the best fit\nwould have their central engines obscured. This relatively low obscuration\nprobability can explain the clear appearance of the 10-mic emission feature in\nSST1721+6012 together with its rarity among other QSO2. (2) We also fitted the\nSED of PG1211+143, one of the first type 1 QSOs with a 10-mic silicate feature\nin emission. Among similar sources, this QSO appears to display an unusually\nbroadened feature whose peak is shifted toward longer wavelengths. Although\nthis led to suggestions of non-standard dust chemistry in these sources, our\nanalysis fits such SEDs with standard galactic dust; the apparent peak shifts\narise from radiative transfer effects. (3) We find that the distribution of\nsilicate feature strengths among clumpy torus models closely resembles the\nobserved distribution, and the feature never occurs deeply absorbed.

The masses of the primary and secondary\ncomponents have been found to be 1.65$\\pm$0.09 and 0.99$\\pm$0.05 M$_{\\odot}$,\nrespectively. The cross-correlation functions indicate triple peaks which show\npresence of a tertiary star. The spectroscopic properties of this additional\ncomponent resemble to that of the primary star. The analysis of the light\ncurves yielded that the more massive primary star fills its corresponding Roche\nlobe. The secondary component is at or near Roche lobe indicating a new $\\beta$\nLyrae-type near-contact binary. The orbital inclination is about 40$^{\\circ}$\nand, therefore, the observed light variations are produced only by the\nproximity effects.

This discrepancy is\noriginated from very low effective temperature determined only from the light\ncurve produced by proximity effects.

The work has two aims: one is to develop a t-QCT itself based\non physically natural concept of time, and the other is to pursue the\npossibility of using t-QCT as a tool to estimate the complexity in conventional\ngate-optimal quantum computation theory (g-QCT). In particular, we investigate\nto what extent is true the statement: time complexity is polynomial in the\nnumber of qubits if and only if so is gate complexity. In the analysis, we\nrelate t-QCT and optimal control theory (OCT) through fidelity-optimal\ncomputation theory (f-QCT); f-QCT is equivalent to t-QCT in the limit of unit\noptimal fidelity, while it is formally similar to OCT. We then develop an\nefficient numerical scheme for f-QCT by modifying Krotov's method in OCT, which\nhas monotonic convergence property. We implemented the scheme and obtained\nsolutions of f-QCT and of t-QCT for the quantum Fourier transform and a unitary\noperator that does not have an apparent symmetry. The former has a polynomial\ngate complexity and the latter is expected to have exponential one because a\nseries of generic unitary operators has a exponential gate complexity. The time\ncomplexity for the former is found to be linear in the number of qubits, which\nis understood naturally by the existence of an upper bound. The time complexity\nfor the latter is exponential. Thus the both targets are examples satisfyng the\nstatement above.

We show that the velocity dispersions of McElroy (1983) are severely\nunderestimated (by up to 50 km/s) and previous dynamical models have\nunderestimated the stellar mass of M31's bulge by a factor 2. Moreover, the\nlight-weighted velocity dispersion of the galaxy grows to 166 km/s, thus\nreducing the discrepancy between the predicted and measured mass of the black\nhole at the center of M31. The kinematic position angle varies with distance,\npointing to triaxiality. We detect gas counterrotation near the bulge minor\naxis. We measure eight emission-corrected Lick indices. They are approximately\nconstant on circles. We derive the age, metallicity and alpha-element\noverabundance profiles.

On the other hand, when the non-Markovian is\nsignificantly strong but the bound state is absent, the phenomenon of the ESD\nand its revival is recovered. Our formulation presents a unified picture about\nthe entanglement preservation and provides a clear clue on how to preserve the\nentanglement in quantum information processing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Oct 2009 12:02:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 May 2010 08:37:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Since this\ndepletion process probably only occurs through interaction with a stable disc,\nwe investigate the circumstellar environment of these sources. Methods: A\ndetailed photospheric abundance study was performed using high-resolution UVES\noptical spectra. To study the circumstellar environment we use photometric data\nto construct the spectral energy distributions of the stars, and determine the\ngeometry of the circumstellar environment, whereas low-resolution Spitzer-IRS\ninfrared spectra are used to trace its mineralogy. Results: Our results show\nthat, also in the LMC, the photospheres of RV Tauri stars are commonly affected\nby the depletion process, although it can differ significantly in strength from\nsource to source. From our detailed disc modelling and mineralogy study, we\nfind that this process, as in the Galaxy, appears closely related to the\npresence of a stable Keplerian disc. The newly studied extragalactic objects\nhave similar observational characteristics as Galactic post-AGB binaries\nsurrounded by a dusty disc, and are therefore also believed to be part of a\nbinary system. One source shows a very small infrared excess, atypical for a\ndisc source, but still has evidence for depletion. We speculate this could\npoint to the presence of a very evolved disc, similar to debris discs seen\naround young stellar objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Oct 2009 12:11:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

For practicality however, certain model assumptions are also\nrequired. For example, in the case of subdwarf B stars, one usually starts with\nzero-age horizontal branch structures without following the progenitor\nevolution. We analyse the effects of common assumptions in subdwarf B models on\nthe g-mode pulsational properties. We investigate if and how the pulsation\nperiods are affected by the H-profile in the core-envelope transition zone.\nFurthermore, the effects of C-production and convective mixing during the core\nhelium flash are evaluated. Finally, we reanalyse the effects of stellar\nopacities on the mode excitation in subdwarf B stars. We find that helium\nsettling causes a shift in the theoretical blue edge of the g-mode instability\ndomain to higher effective temperatures. This results in a closer match to the\nobserved instability strip of long-period sdB pulsators, particularly for l<=3\nmodes. We show further that the g-mode spectrum is extremely sensitive to the\nH-profile in the core-envelope transition zone. If atomic diffusion is\nefficient, details of the initial shape of the profile become less important in\nthe course of evolution. Diffusion broadens the chemical gradients, and results\nin less effective mode trapping and different pulsation periods. Furthermore,\nwe report on the possible consequences of the He-flash for the g-modes. The\nouter edge of a flash-induced convective region introduces an additional\nchemical transition in the stellar models, and the corresponding spike in the\nBrunt-Vaisala frequency produces a complicated mode trapping signature in the\nperiod spacings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Oct 2009 13:49:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

We make the assumption\nthat the network is massively dense, i.e., there are so many sources,\ndestinations, and relay nodes, that it is best to describe the network in terms\nof macroscopic parameters, such as their spatial density, rather than in terms\nof microscopic parameters, such as their individual placements.\n  We focus on a particular physical layer model that is characterized by the\nfollowing assumptions: i) the nodes must only transport the data from the\nsources to the destinations, and do not need to sense the data at the sources,\nor deliver them at the destinations once the data arrive at their physical\nlocations, and ii) the nodes have limited bandwidth available to them, but they\nuse it optimally to locally achieve the network capacity.\n  In this setting, the optimal distribution of nodes induces a traffic density\nthat resembles the electric displacement that will be created if we substitute\nthe sources and destinations with positive and negative charges respectively.\nThe analogy between the two settings is very tight and have a direct\ninterpretation in wireless sensor networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Oct 2009 14:02:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

For elliptical, lenticular, and\nhigh-mass (log M*/M_sun > 10) spiral galaxies we find no evidence to suggest\nany such environmental dependence, implying that internal drivers are governing\ntheir size evolution. For intermediate/low-mass spirals (log M*/M_sun < 10) we\nfind evidence, significant at the 2-sigma level, for a possible environmental\ndependence on galaxy sizes: the mean effective radius a_e for lower-mass\nspirals is ~15-20 per cent larger in the field than in the cluster. This is due\nto a population of low-mass large-a_e field spirals that are largely absent\nfrom the cluster environments. These large-a_e field spirals contain extended\nstellar discs not present in their cluster counterparts. This suggests the\nfragile extended stellar discs of these spiral galaxies may not survive the\nenvironmental conditions in the cluster.

The X-ray emission is detected only in the south eastern part of\nIC131 (named IC131-se) and is limited to an elliptical region of ~200pc in\nextent. This region appears to be confined towards the west by a hemispherical\nshell of warm ionized gas and only fills about half that volume. Although the\ncorresponding X-ray spectrum has 1215 counts, it cannot conclusively be told\nwhether the extended X-ray emission is thermal, non-thermal, or a combination\nof both. A thermal plasma model of kT_e=4.3keV or a single power law of\nGamma=2.1 fit the spectrum equally well. If the spectrum is purely thermal\n(non-thermal), the total unabsorbed X-ray luminosity in the 0.35-8keV energy\nband amounts to L_X = 6.8(8.7)x10^35erg/s. Among other known HII regions\nIC131-se seems to be extreme regarding the combination of its large extent of\nthe X-ray plasma, the lack of massive O stars, its unusually high electron\ntemperature (if thermal), and the large fraction of L_X emitted above 2keV\n(~40-53%). A thermal plasma of ~4keV poses serious challenges to theoretical\nmodels, as it is not clear how high electron temperatures can be produced in\nHII regions in view of mass-proportional and collisionless heating. If the gas\nis non-thermal or has non-thermal contributions, synchrotron emission would\nclearly dominate over inverse Compton emission. It is not clear if the same\nmechanisms which create non-thermal X-rays or accelerate CRs in SNRs can be\napplied to much larger scales of 200pc. In both cases the existing theoretical\nmodels for giant HII regions and superbubbles do not explain the hardness and\nextent of the X-ray emission in IC131-se.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Oct 2009 15:49:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}
