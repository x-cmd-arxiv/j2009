We first\nanalyze the fact that equilibrium thermodynamics may reveal the existence of an\nunderlying dynamics. This is true in the algebraic approach of quantum\nmechanics via the Tomita-Takesaki theorem. A similar result is obtained if we\nstart from the path integral expression of the partition function, an equation\nof motion is introduced. In both cases a parameter has to be identified with\nthe physical time. Several arguments are presented showing that it is so. By\ninvestigating the dynamics for short times we introduce an equilibrium\ncondition from which a natural unit of time appears. The equation of motion is\nextended to non equilibrium situations for which a H-theorem can be derived.\nThe equation of motion can be transformed into a quantum Smoluchovski equation,\nits solution is a probability having a clear physical meaning. The relaxation\nof this probability towards its equilibrium value requires a time during which\na thermodynamic description is possible or not. A standard bistable model is\ninvestigated and the chemical rate $k(t)$ is calculated as a function of time,\nit appears to be a non monotonic function of time. In some conditions the\nstationary value of $k(t)$ can be identified with the Kramers result. Finally\nwe compare our approach which is naturally irreversible with an analysis based\non the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation which is reversible. From all these results it\nappears that our equation of motion or its Smoluchovski version appear as a\nrealistic starting point for describing quantum dissipation in small systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2009 13:11:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2010 14:35:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 3 May 2010 13:51:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-04"}

Radio halos provide one of the\nmost important pieces of evidence for non-thermal components in large scale\nstructure. Statistics of their properties can be used to discriminate among\nvarious models for their origin. Therefore, theoretical predictions of the\noccurrence of radio halos are important as several new radio telescopes are\nabout to begin to survey the sky at low frequencies with unprecedented\nsensitivity. In this paper we carry out Monte Carlo simulations to model the\nformation and evolution of radio halos in a cosmological framework. We extend\nprevious works on the statistical properties of radio halos in the context of\nthe turbulent re-acceleration model. First we compute the fraction of galaxy\nclusters that show radio halos and derive the luminosity function of radio\nhalos. Then, we derive differential and integrated number count distributions\nof radio halos at low radio frequencies with the main goal to explore the\npotential of the upcoming LOFAR surveys. By restricting to the case of clusters\nat redshifts <0.6, we find that the planned LOFAR all sky survey at 120 MHz is\nexpected to detect about 350 giant radio halos. About half of these halos have\nspectral indices larger than 1.9 and substantially brighten at lower\nfrequencies. If detected they will allow for a confirmation that turbulence\naccelerates the emitting particles. We expect that also commissioning surveys,\nsuch as MSSS, have the potential to detect about 60 radio halos in clusters of\nthe ROSAT Brightest Cluster Sample and its extension (eBCS). These surveys will\nallow us to constrain how the rate of formation of radio halos in these\nclusters depends on cluster mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Oct 2009 17:39:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Based on full-potential band\nstructure calculations, we derive the relevant microscopic parameters, estimate\nindividual exchange couplings, and establish a realistic spin model of this\ncompound. The structure of CuNCN contains chains of edge-sharing CuN(4)\nsquares. As a surprise, in contrast to analogous [CuO(2)] chains in\n\"edge-sharing\" cuprates, the leading magnetic interactions J ~ 2500 K run\nperpendicular to the structural [CuN(2)] chains via bridging NCN groups. The\nresulting spin model of a uniform chain is in agreement with the experimentally\nobserved temperature-independent magnetic susceptibility below 300 K. The\nnearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor interactions along the structural\n[CuN(2)] chains are J(1) ~ -500 K and J(2) ~ 100 K, respectively. Despite the\nfrustrating nature of J(1) and J(2), we assign the anomaly at 70 K to\nlong-range magnetic ordering, which is likely collinear with antiparallel and\nparallel arrangement of spins along the 'c' and 'a' directions, respectively.\nThe pronounced one-dimensionality of the spin system should lead to a reduction\nin the ordered moment and to a suppression of the transition anomaly in the\nspecific heat, thus impeding the experimental observation of the long-range\nordering. Our results suggest CuNCN as a promising material for ballistic heat\ntransport within spin chains, while the sizable bandwidth W ~ 3 eV may lead to\na metal-insulator transition and other exotic properties under high pressure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Oct 2009 22:17:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

A discussion on the accuracy of the Fourier-based iron abundances,\ntemperatures, masses and radii is given. New periods are found for the 5 known\nSX Phe stars and a critical discussion of their secular period changes is\noffered. The mean iron abundance for the RR Lyrae stars is found to be [Fe/H]\n$\\sim -1.97 \\pm 0.16$ and lower values are not supported by the present\nanalysis. The absolute magnitude calibrations of the RR Lyrae stars yield an\naverage true distance modulus of $16.12 \\pm 0.04$ or a distance of $16.7 \\pm\n0.3$ kpc. Comparison of the observational CMD with theoretical isochrones\nindicates an age of $12.5 \\pm 2.0$ Gyrs for the cluster. A careful\nidentification of all reported Blue Stragglers (BS) and their $V,I$ magnitudes\nleads to the conclusion that BS12, BS22, BS23 and BS24 are not BS. On the other\nhand, three new BS are reported. Variability was found in seven BS, very likely\nof the SX Phe type in five of them, and in one red giant star. The new SX Phe\nstars follow established $PL$ relationships and indicate a distance in\nagreement with the distance from the RR Lyrae stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2009 01:13:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

This group theoretical property was believed by Einstein to be\na relevant one from a physical standpoint, because the general coordinates\nallowed to introduce reference frames not limited to the inertial reference\nframes that can be associated with the Minkowski coordinate systems, whose\ntransformation group was perceived to be restricted to the Poincar\\'e group.\nTwo years later, however, Kretschmann published a paper in which the physical\nrelevance of the group theoretical achievement in the general relativity of\n1915 was denied. For Kretschmann, since any theory, whatever its physical\ncontent, can be rewritten in a generally covariant form, the group of general\ncoordinate transformations is physically irrelevant. This is not the case,\nhowever, for the group of the infinitesimal motions that bring the metric field\nin itself, namely, for the Killing group. This group is physically\ncharacteristic of any given spacetime theory, since it accounts for the local\ninvariance properties of the considered manifold, i.e., for its ``relativity\npostulate''. In the present chapter it is shown what are the consequences for\nthe physical interpretation of some of these solutions whose relativity\npostulate is of intermediate content, when Kretschmann's standpoint is\nconsistently adhered to.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2009 15:25:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-13"}

A VHE gamma-ray signal was clearly detected with an average\nflux above 200 GeV of ~20 % of the Crab Nebula flux, which indicates a low\nstate of source activity in this energy range. No significant variability has\nbeen found during the campaign. The VHE gamma-ray spectrum can be described by\na simple power-law from 80 GeV to 2 TeV with a photon index of 2.8+/-0.1, which\ncorresponds to one of the steepest photon indices observed in this energy range\nso far for this object. The X-ray spectrum covers a wide range from 0.6 to 40\nkeV, and is well described by a broken power law, with photon indices of\n2.257+/-0.004 and 2.420+/-0.012 below and above the break energy of 3.24+/-0.13\nkeV. No apparent high-energy cut off is seen above the break energy. Although\nan increase of the flux of about 50 % is observed in the X-ray band within the\nobservation, the data indicate a consistently low state of activity for this\nsource. Time-resolved spectra show an evidence for spectral hardening with a\nflux level. A homogeneous one-zone synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model can\nadequately describe the SED from the X-ray to the VHE gamma-ray bands with a\nmagnetic field intensity B=0.313 G and a Doppler beaming factor delta = 20,\nwhich are similar to the values in the past multiwavelength campaigns in high\nstates. Based on our SSC parameters derived for the low state, we are able to\nreproduce the SED of the high state by just changing the Lorentz factor of the\nelectrons corresponding to the break energy in the primary electron spectrum.\nThis suggests that the variation of the injected electron population in the jet\nis responsible for the observed low-high state variation of the SED.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2009 07:08:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-04"}

Its positivity results in the monotonic decrease of\nthe informational entropy under renormalization. This, however, does not\nnecessarily imply the irreversibility of the RG flow, because the entropy\nexplicitly depends on the total number of degrees of freedom, which is reduced.\nOnly some size-independent additive part of the entropy could possibly provide\nthe required Lyapunov function. We also introduce a mutual information of fast\nand slow variables as probably a more adequate quantity to represent the\nchanges in the system under renormalization and evaluate it for some simple\nsystems.

The existence of Nash Equilibria,\ncongestion and the amount of inefficiency caused by this selfish routing is a\nmajor concern in this field.

In this paper, by considering the effect of the instability of\naccretion disk on the evolution of white dwarf (WD) binaries, we performed\nbinary evolution calculations for about 2400 close WD binaries, in which a\ncarbon--oxygen WD accretes material from a main-sequence star or a slightly\nevolved subgiant star (WD + MS channel), or a red-giant star (WD + RG channel)\nto increase its mass to the Chandrasekhar (Ch) mass limit. According to these\ncalculations, we mapped out the initial parameters for SNe Ia in the orbital\nperiod--secondary mass ($\\log P^{\\rm i}-M^{\\rm i}_2$) plane for various WD\nmasses for these two channels, respectively. We confirm that WDs in the WD + MS\nchannel with a mass as low as $0.61 M_\\odot$ can accrete efficiently and reach\nthe Ch limit, while the lowest WD mass for the WD + RG channel is $1.0 \\rm\nM_\\odot$. We have implemented these results in a binary population synthesis\nstudy to obtain the SN Ia birthrates and the evolution of SN Ia birthrates with\ntime for both a constant star formation rate and a single starburst. We find\nthat the Galactic SN Ia birthrate from the WD + MS channel is $\\sim$$1.8\\times\n10^{-3} {\\rm yr}^{-1}$ according to our standard model, which is higher than\nprevious results. However, similar to previous studies, the birthrate from the\nWD + RG channel is still low ($\\sim$$3\\times 10^{-5} {\\rm yr}^{-1}$).

Our treatment is\nnonperturbative in the shear strength and makes systematic use of both the\nshearing coordinate transformation and the Galilean invariance of the linear\nshear flow. The velocity fluctuations are assumed to have low magnetic Reynolds\nnumber (Rm) but could have arbitrary fluid Reynolds number. The magnetic\nfluctuations are determined to lowest order in Rm by explicit calculation of\nthe resistive Green's function for the linear shear flow. The mean\nelectromotive force is calculated and an integro-differential equation is\nderived for the time evolution of the mean magnetic field. In this equation,\nvelocity fluctuations contribute to two different kinds of terms, the C and D\nterms, in which first and second spatial derivatives of the mean magnetic\nfield, respectively, appear inside the spacetime integrals. The contribution of\nthe D terms is such that the time evolution of the cross-shear components of\nthe mean field do not depend on any other components excepting themselves.\nTherefore, to lowest order in Rm but to all orders in the shear strength, the D\nterms cannot give rise to a shear-current assisted dynamo effect. Casting the\nintegro-differential equation in Fourier space, we show that the normal modes\nof the theory are a set of shearing waves, labelled by their sheared\nwavevectors. The integral kernels are expressed in terms of the velocity\nspectrum tensor, which is the fundamental quantity that needs to be specified\nto complete the integro-differential equation description of the time evolution\nof the mean magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2009 12:00:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2010 09:10:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

To give a classical example,\nclassification and regression trees are easy to understand and interpret. Tree\nensembles like Random Forests provide usually more accurate predictions. Yet\ntree ensembles are also more difficult to analyze than single trees and are\noften criticized, perhaps unfairly, as `black box' predictors. Node harvest is\ntrying to reconcile the two aims of interpretability and predictive accuracy by\ncombining positive aspects of trees and tree ensembles. Results are very sparse\nand interpretable and predictive accuracy is extremely competitive, especially\nfor low signal-to-noise data. The procedure is simple: an initial set of a few\nthousand nodes is generated randomly. If a new observation falls into just a\nsingle node, its prediction is the mean response of all training observation\nwithin this node, identical to a tree-like prediction. A new observation falls\ntypically into several nodes and its prediction is then the weighted average of\nthe mean responses across all these nodes. The only role of node harvest is to\n`pick' the right nodes from the initial large ensemble of nodes by choosing\nnode weights, which amounts in the proposed algorithm to a quadratic\nprogramming problem with linear inequality constraints. The solution is sparse\nin the sense that only very few nodes are selected with a nonzero weight. This\nsparsity is not explicitly enforced. Maybe surprisingly, it is not necessary to\nselect a tuning parameter for optimal predictive accuracy. Node harvest can\nhandle mixed data and missing values and is shown to be simple to interpret and\ncompetitive in predictive accuracy on a variety of data sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2009 12:12:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2011 09:02:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-10"}

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We\nevaluated 23 surgeons' accuracy inserting a guide-wire in a human cadaver\nexperiment, following a pre-established procedure. These medical trainees were\ndefined in three prospective respects: novice or skilled; with or without\ntheoretical knowledge; with or without surgical procedure familiarity.

RESULTS: An average number of 13 X-rays was\nrequired for wire implantation by the G1 group. G2 group, assisted by the\nsimulator use, required an average of 10 X-rays. A substantial difference was\nespecially observed within the novice sub-group (N), with an average of 12.75\nX-rays for the G1 category and an average of 8.5 X-rays for the G2 category.

In history, the black hole was\nfirst discussed by Laplace under the Newton mechanics, whose event horizon\nradius is the same as the Schwarzschild's solution of the Einstein's vacuum\nfield equations. If all those objects having such an event horizon radius but\ndifferent gravitational fields are called as black holes, then one can simulate\ncertain properties of the black holes using electromagnetic fields and\nmetamaterials due to the similar propagation behaviours of electromagnetic\nwaves in curved space and in inhomogeneous metamaterials. In a recent\ntheoretical work by Narimanov and Kildishev, an optical black hole has been\nproposed based on metamaterials, in which the theoretical analysis and\nnumerical simulations showed that all electromagnetic waves hitting it are\ntrapped and absorbed. Here we report the first experimental demonstration of\nsuch an electromagnetic black hole in the microwave frequencies. The proposed\nblack hole is composed of non-resonant and resonant metamaterial structures,\nwhich can trap and absorb electromagnetic waves coming from all directions\nspirally inwards without any reflections due to the local control of\nelectromagnetic fields and the event horizon corresponding to the device\nboundary. It is shown that the absorption rate can reach 99% in the microwave\nfrequencies.

This article\ngeneralizes the notion of hyperuniformity to include also two-phase random\nheterogeneous media. Hyperuniform random media do not possess\ninfinite-wavelength volume fraction fluctuations, implying that the variance in\nthe local volume fraction in an observation window decays faster than the\nreciprocal window volume as the window size increases. For microstructures of\nimpenetrable and penetrable spheres, we derive an upper bound on the asymptotic\ncoefficient governing local volume fraction fluctuations in terms of the\ncorresponding quantity describing the variance in the local number density\n(i.e., number variance). Extensive calculations of the asymptotic number\nvariance coefficients are performed for a number of disordered (e.g.,\nquasiperiodic tilings, classical stealth disordered ground states, and certain\ndeterminantal point processes), quasicrystal, and ordered (e.g., Bravais and\nnon-Bravais periodic systems) hyperuniform structures in various Euclidean\nspace dimensions, and our results are consistent with a quantitative order\nmetric characterizing the degree of hyperuniformity.

The relay decodes the\ninformation from the sources and it properly combines and re-encodes them to\ngenerate some extra redundancy, which is transmitted to the destination. The\namount of redundancy generated by the relay can simply be adjusted according to\nrequirements in terms of performance, throughput and/or power. At the\ndestination, decoding of the information of all sources is performed jointly\nexploiting the redundancy provided by the relay in an iterative fashion. The\noverall communication network can be viewed as a serially concatenated code.\nThe proposed distributed scheme achieves significant performance gains with\nrespect to the non-cooperation system, even for a very large number of users.\nFurthermore, it presents a high flexibility in terms of code rate, block length\nand number of users.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2009 14:50:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-13"}

It is well known that this coupling shifts the turnover\nscale as well as suppresses the amplitude of the matter power spectrum.\nHowever, these effects are too small to be observed when we limit the coupling\nstrength to be consistent with observations. Since the coupling of quintessence\nto baryons is strongly constrained, species dependent coupling may arise. This\nresults in a baryon bias that is dif- ferent from unity. Thus, we look over the\ncorrelation function in this coupled model. We find that even the non-coupled\nquintessence model gives the better fit to the correlation function compared to\nthe cosmo- logical constant model. We are also able to observe the enhancement\nof the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) peak due to the increasing bias factor\nof baryon from this species dependent coupling. In order to avoid the damping\neffect of the BAO signature in the matter power spectrum due to nonlinear\nclustering, we consider the coupling effect on the BAO bump in the linear\nregime. This provides an alternative method to constrain the coupling of dark\nenergy to dark matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2009 15:06:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2010 05:35:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-29"}
