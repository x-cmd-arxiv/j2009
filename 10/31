In this paper we revisit the question of\ngamma-ray light-curve formation in pulsars in order to ascertain the robustness\nof the \"two-pole caustic\" (TPC) and \"outer gap\" (OG) models based on the vacuum\nmagnetic field. We point out an inconsistency in the literature on the use of\nthe relativistic aberration formula, where in several works the vacuum field\nwas treated as known in the instantaneously corotating frame, rather than in\nthe laboratory frame. With the corrected formula, we find that the peaks in the\nlight curves predicted from the TPC model using the vacuum field are less\nsharp. The sharpness of the peaks in the OG model is less affected by this\nchange, but the range of magnetic inclination angles and viewing geometries\nresulting in double-peaked light curves is reduced. In a realistic\nmagnetosphere, the modification of field structure near the light cylinder due\nto plasma effects may change the shape of the polar cap and the location of the\nemission zones. We study the sensitivity of the light curves to different\nshapes of the polar cap for static and retarded vacuum dipole fields. In\nparticular, we consider polar caps traced by the last open field lines and\ncompare them to circular polar caps. We find that the TPC model is very\nsensitive to the shape of the polar cap, and a circular polar cap can lead to\nfour peaks of emission. The OG model is less affected by polar cap shapes, but\nis subject to big uncertainties of applying the vacuum field near the light\ncylinder. We conclude that deviations from vacuum field can lead to large\nuncertainties in the pulse shapes, and a more realistic force-free field should\nbe applied to the study of pulsar high energy emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2009 19:12:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 1 Nov 2009 19:59:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 11 Apr 2010 01:40:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

This approximation ignores changes in the field structure\ncaused by the magnetospheric plasma and strong plasma currents. We present the\nfirst results of gamma-ray pulsar light curve modeling using the more realistic\nfield taken from 3D force-free magnetospheric simulations. Having the geometry\nof the field, we apply several prescriptions for the location of the emission\nzone, comparing the light curves to observations. We find that the conventional\ntwo-pole caustic model fails to produce double-peak pulse profiles, mainly\nbecause the size of the polar cap in force-free magnetosphere is larger than\nthe vacuum field polar cap. The conventional outer-gap model is capable of\nproducing only one peak under general conditions, because a large fraction of\nopen field lines does not cross the null charge surface. We propose a novel\n\"separatrix layer\" model, where the high-energy emission originates from a thin\nlayer on the open field lines just inside of the separatrix that bounds the\nopen flux tube. The emission from this layer generates two strong caustics on\nthe sky map due to the effect we term \"Sky Map Stagnation\" (SMS). It is related\nto the fact that force-free field asymptotically approaches the field of a\nrotating split monopole, and the photons emitted on such field lines in the\nouter magnetosphere arrive to the observer in phase. The double-peak light\ncurve is a natural consequence of SMS. We show that most features of the\ncurrently available gamma-ray pulsar light curves can be reasonably well\nreproduced and explained with the sepatratrix model using the force-free field.\nAssociation of the emission region with the current sheet will guide more\ndetailed future studies of the magnetospheric acceleration physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2009 19:16:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 1 Nov 2009 20:39:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 11 Apr 2010 01:55:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

We address this puzzle with the model of\ncoupled radius-orbit tidal evolution developed by\n\\citet{Ibgui_and_Burrows_2009}. The planetary radius is evolved\nself-consistently with orbital parameters, under the influence of tidal torques\nand tidal dissipation in the interior of the planet. A general feature of this\nmodel, which we have previously demonstrated in the generic case, is that a\npossible transient inflation of the planetary radius can temporarily interrupt\nits standard monotonic shrinking and can lead to the inflated radii that we\nobserve. In particular, a bloated planet with even a circular orbit may still\nbe inflated due to an earlier episode of tidal heating. We have modified our\nmodel to include an orbital period dependence of the tidal dissipation factor\nin the star, $Q'_{\\ast} \\propto P^{\\gamma}$, $-1 \\leqslant \\gamma \\leqslant 1$.\nWith this model, we search, for a tidally heated planet, orbital and radius\nevolutionary tracks that fall within the observational limits of the radius,\nthe semimajor axis, and the eccentricity of the planet in its current estimated\nage range. We find that, for some inflated planets (WASP-6b and WASP-15b),\nthere are such tracks; for another (TrES-4), there are none; and for still\nothers (WASP-4b and WASP-12b), there are such tracks, but our model might imply\nthat we are observing the planets at a special time. Finally, we stress that\nthere is a two to three order-of-magnitude timescale uncertainty of the\ninspiraling phase of the planet into its host star, arising from uncertainties\nin the tidal dissipation factor in the star $Q'_{\\ast}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2009 17:45:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-17"}

We show that the matrix-valued imaginary part of the electron\nself-energy can be consistently related to the pole shift, and that the\npresence of the heat bath leads to appearance of an effective varepsilon sim T,\nthus providing a natural infrared regulator of the theory.

For searches which use the Moon as a target, we summarize the\nphysics of the interaction, properties of the resulting Cerenkov radio pulse,\ndetection statistics, effective aperture scaling laws, and derivation of upper\nlimits for isotropic and point source models. We report on initial results from\nthe RESUN search, which uses the Expanded Very Large Array configured in\nmultiple sub-arrays of four antennas at 1.45 GHz pointing along the lunar limb.\nWe detected no pulses of lunar origin during 45 observing hours. This implies\nupper limits to the differential neutrino flux E^2 dN/dE < 0.003 EeV km^{-2}\ns^{-1} sr^{-1} and < 0.0003 EeV km$^{-2} s^{-1} at 90% confidence level for\nisotropic and sampled point sources respectively, in the neutrino energy range\n10^{21.6} < E(eV) < 10^{22.6}. The isotropic flux limit is comparable to the\nlowest published upper limits for lunar searches. The full RESUN search, with\nan additional 200 hours observing time and an improved data acquisition scheme,\nwill be be an order of magnitude more sensitive in the energy range 10^{21} <\nE(eV) < 10^{22} than previous lunar-target searches, and will test Z burst\nmodels of neutrino generation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2009 19:27:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-05"}

Alice and Bob begin with N\nidentical (but unknown) two-qubit pure states, each containing E ebits of\nentanglement. They each run a reversible algorithm on their qubits, and end up\nwith Y perfect EPR pairs, where Y = NE +- O(\\sqrt N). Our protocol is\nstreaming, so the N input systems are fed in one at a time, and perfect EPR\npairs start popping out almost immediately. It matches the optimal block\nprotocol exactly at each stage, so the average yield after n inputs is <Y> = nE\n- O(log n). So, somewhat surprisingly, there is no tradeoff between yield and\nlag -- our protocol optimizes both. In contrast, the optimal N-qubit block\nprotocol achieves the same yield, but since no EPR pairs are produced until the\nentire input block is read, its lag is O(N). Finally, our algorithm runs in\nO(log N) space, so a lot of entanglement can be efficiently concentrated using\na very small (e.g., current or near-future technology) quantum processor.

We discuss how all parameters of the canonical type-I\nseesaw mechanism can, in principle, be reconstructed from the neutrino mass\nmatrix and the deviation of the effective low-energy leptonic mixing matrix\nfrom unitary. When the mass M' of the lightest right-handed neutrino is much\nlighter than the masses of the others, we show that its decay asymmetries\nwithin flavour-dependent leptogenesis can be expressed in terms of two\ncontributions, one depending on the unique dimension five (d=5) operator\ngenerating neutrino masses and one depending on the dimension six (d=6)\noperator associated with non-unitarity. In low-energy seesaw scenarios where\nsmall lepton number violation explains the smallness of neutrino masses, the\nlepton number conserving d=6 operator contribution generically dominates over\nthe d=5 operator contribution which results in a strong enhancement of the\nflavour-dependent decay asymmetries without any resonance effects. To calculate\nthe produced final baryon asymmetry, the flavour equilibration effects directly\nrelated to non-unitarity have to be taken into account. In a simple realization\nof this non-unitarity driven leptogenesis, the lower bound on M' is found to be\nabout 10^8 GeV at the onset of the strong washout regime, more than one order\nof magnitude below the bound in \"standard\" thermal leptogenesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2009 20:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2009 17:46:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-23"}

The spatial extent (~4-8 kpc) of the high\nvelocity and broad [OIII] emission are consistent with that found in z>2 radio\ngalaxies, indicating the presence of a large-scale energetic outflow in a\ngalaxy population potentially orders of magnitude more common than distant\nradio galaxies. The low radio luminosity of this system indicates that\nradio-bright jets are unlikely to be responsible for driving the outflow.\nHowever, the estimated energy input required to produce the large-scale outflow\nsignatures (of order ~10^59 ergs over ~30 Myrs) could be delivered by a wind\nradiatively driven by the AGN and/or supernovae winds from intense star\nformation. The energy injection required to drive the outflow is comparable to\nthe estimated binding energy of the galaxy spheroid, suggesting that it can\nhave a significant impact on the evolution of the galaxy.

The mid-infrared excess of V819 Tau can be successfully modeled\nwith dust composed mostly of small amorphous olivine grains at a temperature of\n85 K, and most of the excess emission is optically thin. The disk could still\nbe primordial, but gas-poor and therefore short-lived, or already at the debris\ndisk stage, which would make it one of the youngest debris disk systems known.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2009 22:48:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

Two examples including a two-level system and a\nthree-level system are presented to demonstrate the proposed SMC method.

It is a very hard job to treat\nthese in the continuum, even in a partial manner. A decent way to do so was\nworked out by Gribov, and later on by Zwanziger. The final point was a\nrenormalizable action (the Gribov-Zwanziger action), implementing the\nrestriction of the path integration to the so-called Gribov region, which is\nfree of a subset of gauge copies, but not of all copies. Till recently,\neverybody agreed upon the fact that the restriction to the Gribov region\nimplied a infrared enhanced ghost, and vanishing zero momentum gluon\npropagator. We discuss how the Gribov-Zwanziger action naturally leads to the\nexistence of vacuum condensates of dimension two. As it is very common, such\ncondensates can seriously alter the dynamics. In particular, the\nGribov-Zwanziger condensates give rise to a gluon propagator with a finite but\nnonvanishing zero momentum limit, and reconstitute a nonenhanced ghost. We call\nthis the refined Gribov-Zwanziger framework. The predictions are in qualitative\nagreement with most recent lattice simulations, and certain solutions of the\nSchwinger-Dyson equations.

System\nSci. 51 (3), 390-399, 1995) showed that there exists a polynomial-time\nalgorithm for the problem achieving this bound up to a constant factor. Their\nalgorithm invokes the ellipsoid algorithm at each iteration for determining the\nnext comparison, making it impractical.\n  We develop efficient algorithms for sorting under partial information. Like\nKahn and Kim, our approach relies on graph entropy. However, our algorithms\ndiffer in essential ways from theirs. Rather than resorting to convex\nprogramming for computing the entropy, we approximate the entropy, or make sure\nit is computed only once, in a restricted class of graphs, permitting the use\nof a simpler algorithm. Specifically, we present:\n  - an O(n^2) algorithm performing O(log n log e(P)) comparisons;\n  - an O(n^2.5) algorithm performing at most (1+ epsilon) log e(P) + O_epsilon\n(n) comparisons;\n  - an O(n^2.5) algorithm performing O(log e(P)) comparisons.\n  All our algorithms can be implemented in such a way that their computational\nbottleneck is confined in a preprocessing phase, while the sorting phase is\ncompleted in O(q) + O(n) time, where q denotes the number of comparisons\nperformed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Oct 2009 14:36:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Sep 2010 12:58:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 21 Jan 2013 13:56:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-22"}
