In\nWitten's approach, one has only take into account the fermion loops, which\nbring about a negative shift of the (chosen positive at the tree level)\nChern-Simons coupling k. As a result, Witten index vanishes and supersymmetry\nis broken at small k. In the effective BO Hamiltonian framework, fermion, gluon\nand ghost loops contribute on an equal footing. Fermion loop contribution to\nthe effective Hamiltonian can be evaluated exactly, and their effect amounts to\nthe negative shift k -> k - h/2 for N =1 and k -> k - h for N = 2,3 in the\ntree-level formulae for the index. In our approach, with rather natural\nassumptions on the structure of bosonic corrections, the shift k -> k + h\nbrought about by the gluon loops also affects the index.

Favoring\nplayers with higher fitness, the latter is key for understanding the challenges\nfaced by cooperators when competing with defectors. Evolutionary game theory\nprovides a competent theoretical framework for addressing the subtleties of\ncooperation in such situations, which are known as social dilemmas. Recent\nadvances point towards the fact that the evolution of strategies alone may be\ninsufficient to fully exploit the benefits offered by cooperative behavior.\nIndeed, while spatial structure and heterogeneity, for example, have been\nrecognized as potent promoters of cooperation, coevolutionary rules can extend\nthe potentials of such entities further, and even more importantly, lead to the\nunderstanding of their emergence. The introduction of coevolutionary rules to\nevolutionary games implies, that besides the evolution of strategies, another\nproperty may simultaneously be subject to evolution as well.

Since\nthe cooling time of this gas is only a few million years, NGC 4649 provides the\nmost acutely concentrated known example of the cooling flow problem in which\nthe time-integrated apparent mass that has flowed into the galactic core\nexceeds the total mass observed there. This paradox can be resolved by\nintermittent outflows of energy or mass driven by accretion energy released\nnear the black hole. Inflowing gas is also required at intermediate kpc radii\nto explain the ellipticity of X-ray isophotes due to spin-up by mass ejected by\nstars that rotate with the galaxy and to explain local density and temperature\nprofiles. We provide evidence that many luminous elliptical galaxies undergo\nsimilar inflow spin-up. A small turbulent viscosity is required in NGC 4649 to\navoid forming large X-ray luminous disks that are not observed, but the\nturbulent pressure is small and does not interfere with mass determinations\nthat assume hydrostatic equilibrium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2009 05:10:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

At the same time, job markets are a natural example of\ntwo-sided matching markets. An important solution concept in such markets is\nthat of stable matchings, and the use of the celebrated Gale-Shapley algorithm\nto compute them. So far, the literature has evolved separately, either focusing\non the implications of information flowing through a social network, or on\ndeveloping a mathematical theory of job markets through the use of two-sided\nmatching techniques.\n  In this paper we provide a model of the job market that brings both aspects\nof job markets together. To model the social scientists' observations, we\nassume that workers learn only about positions in firms through social\ncontacts. Given that information structure, we study both static properties of\nwhat we call locally stable matchings (i.e., stable matchings subject to\ninformational constraints given by a social network) and dynamic properties\nthrough a reinterpretation of Gale-Shapley's algorithm as myopic best response\ndynamics.\n  We prove that, in general, the set of locally stable matching strictly\ncontains that of stable matchings and it is in fact NP-complete to determine if\nthey are identical. We also show that the lattice structure of stable matchings\nis in general absent. Finally, we focus on myopic best response dynamics\ninspired by the Gale-Shapley algorithm.

Some previously known results are obtained by\nsimpler and more transparent procedures and are interpreted in an intuitive\nmanner. Specifically: (i) We show that the electrostatic potential of a charge\nat rest in the Rindler frame is expressible as A_0=(q/l) where l is the affine\nparameter distance along the null geodesic from the charge to the field point.\n(ii) We obtain the sum of the electrostatic forces exerted by one charge on\nanother in the Rindler frame and discuss its interpretation. (iii) We show how\na purely electrostatic term in the Rindler frame appears as a radiation term in\nthe inertial frame. (In part, this arises because charges at rest in a weak\ngravitational field possess additional weight due to their electrostatic\nenergy. This weight is proportional to the acceleration and falls inversely\nwith distance -- which are the usual characteristics of a radiation field.)\n(iv) We also interpret the origin of the radiation reaction term by extending\nour approach to include a slowly varying acceleration. Many of these results\nmight have possible extensions for the case of electrostatics in an arbitrary\nstatic geometry.

Indeed, these\nwaves constitute an attractive heating agent due to their ability to carry over\nthe many different layers of the solar atmosphere sufficient energy to heat and\nmaintain a corona. However, due to their incompressible nature these waves need\na mechanism such as mode conversion (leading to shock heating), phase mixing,\nresonant absorption or turbulent cascade in order to heat the plasma. New\nobservations with polarimetric, spectroscopic and imaging instruments such as\nthose on board of the japanese satellite Hinode, or the SST or CoMP, are\nbringing strong evidence for the existence of energetic Alfven waves in the\nsolar corona. In order to assess the role of Alfven waves in coronal heating,\nin this work we model a magnetic flux tube being subject to Alfven wave heating\nthrough the mode conversion mechanism. Using a 1.5-dimensional MHD code we\ncarry out a parameter survey varying the magnetic flux tube geometry (length\nand expansion), the photospheric magnetic field, the photospheric velocity\namplitudes and the nature of the waves (monochromatic or white noise spectrum).\nIt is found that independently of the photospheric wave amplitude and magnetic\nfield a corona can be produced and maintained only for long (> 80 Mm) and thick\n(area ratio between photosphere and corona > 500) loops. Above a critical value\nof the photospheric velocity amplitude (generally a few km/s) the corona can no\nlonger be maintained over extended periods of time and collapses due to the\nlarge momentum of the waves. These results establish several constraints on\nAlfven wave heating as a coronal heating mechanism, especially for active\nregion loops.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2009 09:56:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

This is a consequence of\nintroducing non-linearities in the procedure. However, the maximum attainable\ntransfer will depend on the particular combination of speed and number of\nobjects. In the procedure, we will use $N$ elements, like in the classical\ncase, instead of the $log_2(N)$ states of the quantum algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2009 10:20:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-25"}

Their X-ray spectra are modeled by a combination of a power law with a\nphoton index of 1.5-2 absorbed by a column density of 10^23-24 cm^-2, an\nunabsorbed power law, narrow Gaussian lines, and some additional soft\ncomponents. We find that scattering fractions of 20 among 22 objects are less\nthan a typical value (3%) for Seyfert2s observed so far. In particular, those\nof eight objects are smaller than 0.5%, which are in the range for buried AGNs\nfound in recent hard X-ray surveys. Moreover, [O III] lambda5007 luminosities\nat given X-ray luminosities for some objects are smaller than those for\nSeyfert2s previously known. This fact could be interpreted as a smaller size of\noptical narrow emission line regions produced in the opening direction of the\nobscuring torus.

Recently, the well-known skyline operator was\nreused in metric similarity search as a \"multi-example\" query type. When\napplied on a multi-dimensional database (i.e., on a multi-attribute table), the\ntraditional skyline operator selects all database objects that are not\ndominated by other objects. The metric skyline query adopts the skyline\noperator such that the multiple attributes are represented by distances\n(similarities) to multiple query examples.

In this\napproach only transverse degrees of freedom are thermalized, while the\nlongitudinal motion is described by free streaming. When the energy density of\nthe system drops to a certain value, the system becomes isotropic (locally, in\nthe momentum space) and freezes out. The sudden isotropization transition is\ndescribed with the help of the Landau matching conditions, and the freeze-out\nis modeled with THERMINATOR. Within this scenario one is able to reproduce in\nthe quite satisfactory way the transverse-momentum spectra, the elliptic flow\ncoefficient v2, and the HBT radii of pions and kaons studied at RHIC (Au+Au\ncollisions at the top beam energy). The obtained results indicate that the\nsystem produced at RHIC does not have to be fully thermalized in the early\nstage. On the other hand, the final three-dimensional thermalization is\nnecessary to reproduce the HBT radius Rlong.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2009 12:19:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Jul 2010 09:31:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-01"}

Our goal is to perform spectral analysis and\nclassification of the proposed counterparts to IGR J16358-4726 and IGR\nJ16393-4643 and to establish their nature as X-ray systems. We used the ESO/UT1\nISAAC spectrograph to observe the proposed counterparts to the two sources,\nobtaining K-band medium resolution spectra (R = 500) with a S/N > 140. Data\nreduction was performed with the standard procedure. We classified them by\nmeans of comparison with published atlases. We performed SED fitting in order\nto refine the spectral classification. The two counterparts clearly exhibit the\ntypical features of late-type stars, notably strong CO absorption bands in the\nred part of the spectrum. With information from previous X-ray studies, we\nclassify the two systems as two new members of the SyXB class. For IGR\nJ16393-4643, we considered the most probable counterpart to the system,\nalthough three other objects cannot be completely discarded. For this system,\nwe compared our findings with available orbital solutions, constraining the\norbital parameters and the mass of the companion star.

We limited the analysis to the MUSIC area, for which deep K-band\nobservations obtained with ISAAC@VLT are available, ensuring accurate\nidentifications of the counterparts of the X-ray sources as well as reliable\ndetermination of photometric redshifts and galaxy parameters, such as stellar\nmasses and star formation rates. In particular, we: 1) refined the\nX-ray/infrared/optical association of 179 sources in the MUSIC area detected in\nthe Chandra observation; 2) studied the host galaxies observed and rest frame\ncolors and properties. We found that X-ray selected (L_X>10^{42} erg s^{-1})\nAGN show Spitzer colors consistent with both AGN and starburst dominated\ninfrared continuum; the latter would not have been selected as AGN from\ninfrared diagnostics. The host galaxies of X-ray selected obscured AGN are all\nmassive (M_*>10^{10} M_sun) and, in 50% of the cases, are also actively forming\nstars (1/SSFR<t_{Hubble}) in dusty environments. The median L/LEdd value of the\nactive nucleus is between 2% and 10% depending on the assumed M_{BH}/M_{*}\nratio. Finally, we found that the X-ray selected AGN fraction increases with\nthe stellar mass up to a value of ~30% at z>1 and M_*>3x10^{11} M_sun, a\nfraction significantly higher than in the local Universe for AGN of similar\nluminosities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2009 14:15:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2009 11:13:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}
