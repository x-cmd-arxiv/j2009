Interstellar-medium gas clouds engulfed by the\nexpanding lobes, and photoionized by the active nucleus, are responsible for\nthe radio spectral turnover through free-free absorption (FFA) of the\nsynchrotron photons. The model provides a description of the evolution of the\nspectral energy distribution (SED) of GPS sources with their expansion,\npredicting significant and complex high-energy emission, from the X-ray to the\ngamma-ray frequency domain. Here, we test this model with the broad-band SEDs\nof a sample of eleven X-ray emitting GPS galaxies with Compact-Symmetric-Object\n(CSO) morphology, and show that: (i) the shape of the radio continuum at\nfrequencies lower than the spectral turnover is indeed well accounted for by\nthe FFA mechanism; (ii) the observed X-ray spectra can be interpreted as\nnon-thermal radiation produced via IC scattering of the local radiation fields\noff the lobe particles, providing a viable alternative to the thermal,\naccretion-disk dominated scenario.

Aided by the available deep VLA radio imaging, reaching S_1.4 = 30\nmicro-Jy, we have identified radio counterparts for 17/20 of the 250-micron\nsources. The resulting enhanced positional accuracy of ~1 arcsec has then\nallowed us to exploit the deep multi-frequency imaging of GOODS-South to\nestablish secure galaxy counterparts for the 17 radio-identified sources, and\nplausible galaxy candidates for the 3 radio-unidentified sources.

This model is motivated by wireless communications,\nwhere individual secure messages are broadcast over open media and can be\nreceived by any illegitimate receiver. The secrecy level is measured by the\nequivocation rate at the eavesdropper. We first study the general\n(non-degraded) broadcast channel with an eavesdropper. We present an inner\nbound on the secrecy capacity region for this model. This inner bound is based\non a combination of random binning, and the Gelfand-Pinsker binning. We further\nstudy the situation in which the channels are degraded. For the degraded\nbroadcast channel with an eavesdropper, we present the secrecy capacity region.\nOur achievable coding scheme is based on Covers superposition scheme and random\nbinning. We refer to this scheme as the Secret Superposition Scheme. Our\nconverse proof is based on a combination of the converse proof of the\nconventional degraded broadcast channel and Csiszar Lemma. We then assume that\nthe channels are Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and show that the Secret\nSuperposition Scheme with Gaussian codebook is optimal. The converse proof is\nbased on Costas entropy power inequality. Finally, we use a broadcast strategy\nfor the slowly fading wire-tap channel when only the eavesdroppers channel is\nfixed and known at the transmitter. We derive the optimum power allocation for\nthe coding layers, which maximizes the total average rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2009 19:36:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-20"}

Near caustic crossings, for example, some parts of the\nsource star will be more highly magnified than other parts. The spectrum of the\nstar is then no longer the same as when it is unmagnified, and measurements of\nthe atmospheric parameters and abundances will be affected. The accuracy of\nabundances measured from spectra taken during microlensing events has become\nimportant recently because of the use of highly magnified dwarf stars to probe\nabundance ratios and the abundance distribution in the Galactic bulge. In this\npaper, we investigate the effect of finite source effects on spectra by using\nmagnification profiles motivated by two events to synthesize spectra for dwarfs\nbetween 5000K to 6200K at solar metallicity. We adopt the usual techniques for\nanalyzing the microlensed dwarfs, namely, spectroscopic determination of\ntemperature, gravity, and microturbulent velocity, relying on equivalent\nwidths. We find that ignoring the finite source effects for the more extreme\ncase results in errors in Teff < 45K, in log g of <0.1 dex and in\nmicroturbulent velocity of <0.1 km/s. In total, changes in equivalent widths\nlead to small changes in atmospheric parameters and changes in abundances of\n<0.06 dex, with changes in [FeI/H] of <0.03 dex. For the case with a larger\nsource-lens separation, the error in [FeI/H] is <0.01 dex.

For two types of such systems - namely quantum walks\nand cellular automata - we make this intuition precise by defining an index, a\nquantity that measures the \"net flow of quantum information\" through the\nsystem. The index supplies a complete characterization of two properties of the\ndiscrete dynamics. First, two systems S_1, S_2 can be pieced together, in the\nsense that there is a system S which locally acts like S_1 in one region and\nlike S_2 in some other region, if and only if S_1 and S_2 have the same index.\nSecond, the index labels connected components of such systems: equality of the\nindex is necessary and sufficient for the existence of a continuous deformation\nof S_1 into S_2.

We present new deep near-Infrared (IR) observations of\nthe field containing these transients, and find no counterparts down to a\nlimiting magnitude of K=20.4 mag. We argue that the bright (>1 Jy) radio\ntransients recently reported by Kida et al. are consistent with being\nadditional examples of the Bower et al. transients. We refer to these groups of\nevents as \"long-duration radio transients\". The main characteristics of this\npopulation are: time scales longer than 30 minute but shorter than several\ndays; rate, ~10^3 deg^-2 yr^-1; progenitors sky surface density of >60 deg^-2\n(95% C.L.) at Galactic latitude ~40 deg; 1.4-5 GHz spectral slopes, f_\\nu ~\n\\nu^alpha, with alpha>0; and most notably the lack of any counterparts in\nquiescence in any wavelength. We rule out an association with many types of\nobjects. Galactic brown-dwarfs or some sort of exotic explosions remain\nplausible options. We argue that an attractive progenitor candidate for these\nradio transients is the class of Galactic isolated old neutron stars (NS). We\nconfront this hypothesis with Monte-Carlo simulations of the space distribution\nof old NSs, and find satisfactory agreement for the large areal density.\nFurthermore, the lack of quiescent counterparts is explained quite naturally.\nIn this framework we find: the mean distance to events in the Bower et al.\nsample is of order kpc; the typical distance to the Kida et al. transients are\nconstrained to be between 30 pc and 900 pc (95% C.L.); these events should\nrepeat with a time scale of order several months; and sub-mJy level bursts\nshould exhibit Galactic latitude dependence.

However, the recovery of higher-order\nmultispectra is difficult from realistic data due to their complex response to\ninhomogeneous noise and partial sky coverage, which are often difficult to\nmodel analytically. A traditional alternative is to use one-point cumulants of\nvarious orders, which collapse the information present in a multispectrum to\none number. The disadvantage of such a radical compression of the data is a\nloss of information as to the source of the statistical behaviour.

In standard binary evolution theory an\nepisode of mass transfer or common envelope is inevitable in a binary with such\na small orbital period, which complicates the formation of a black hole with\nsuch a high mass.\n  To explain this system, we discuss a new binary evolution channel (De Mink et\nal. 2009), in which rotational mixing plays an important role. In very massive\nclose binaries, tides force the rotation rate of the stars to be so high that\nrotationally induced mixing becomes very efficient. Helium produced in the\ncenter is mixed throughout the envelope. Instead of expanding during their\nmainsequence evolution (with the inevitable consequence of mass transfer),\nthese stars stay compact, and avoid filling their Roche lobe. They gradually\nevolve into massive helium stars. This scenario naturally leads to the\nformation of very massive black holes in a very close orbit with a less evolved\nmassive companion such as M33 X-7.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2009 08:07:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-21"}

Both theories include pair\nfluctuations and exhibit pseudogap effects, although the nature of this\npseudogap is very different. The pseudogap in finite $T$-extended BCS-Leggett\ntheory is found to follow a BCS-like dispersion which, in turn, is associated\nwith a broadened BCS-like self energy, rather more similar to what is observed\nin high temperature superconductors (albeit, for a d-wave case). The fermionic\nquasi-particle dispersion is different in NSR theory and the damping is\nconsiderably larger. We argue that the two theories are appropriate in\ndifferent temperature regimes with the BCS-Leggett approach more suitable\nnearer to condensation. There should, in effect, be little difference at higher\n$T$ as the pseudogap becomes weaker and where the simplifying approximations\nused in the BCS-Leggett approach break down.

This paper presents two methods for\nutilizing a set of SN light curve templates to classify SN objects. In the\nfirst case we present an updated version of the Bayesian Adaptive Template\nMatching program (BATM). To address some shortcomings of that strictly Bayesian\napproach, we introduce a method for Supernova Ontology with Fuzzy Templates\n(SOFT), which utilizes Fuzzy Set Theory for the definition and combination of\nSN light curve models. For well-sampled light curves with a modest signal to\nnoise ratio (S/N>10), the SOFT method can correctly separate thermonuclear\n(Type Ia) SNe from core collapse SNe with 98% accuracy. In addition, the SOFT\nmethod has the potential to classify supernovae into sub-types, providing\nphotometric identification of very rare or peculiar explosions. The accuracy\nand precision of the SOFT method is verified using Monte Carlo simulations as\nwell as real SN light curves from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the\nSuperNova Legacy Survey. In a subsequent paper the SOFT method is extended to\naddress the problem of parameter estimation, providing estimates of redshift,\ndistance, and host galaxy extinction without any spectroscopy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2009 21:10:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

Since the evaporation of gas in the disk can lead to its\ntruncation for accretion rates less than a maximal evaporation rate, the model\ncan naturally account for the soft spectrum in high luminosity AGNs and the\nhard spectrum in low luminosity AGNs. The existence of two different luminosity\nlevels describing transitions from the soft to hard state and from the hard to\nsoft state in BHXRBs, when applied to AGNs, suggests that AGNs can be in either\nspectral state within a range of luminosities. For example, at a viscosity\nparameter, \\alpha, equal to 0.3, the Eddington ratio from the hard to soft\ntransition and from the soft to hard transition occurs at 0.027 and 0.005\nrespectively. When the Eddington ratio of the AGN lies below the critical value\ncorresponding to its evolutionary state, the disk is truncated. With decreasing\nEddington ratios, the inner edge of the disk increases to greater distances\nfrom the black hole with a concomitant increase in the inner radius of the\nbroad line region, $R_{BLR}$. The absence of an optically thick inner disk at\nlow luminosities gives rise to region in the size of borad line-luminosity\nplane for which the relation $R_{BLR} \\propto L^{1/2}$ inferred at high\nluminosities is excluded. As a result, a lower limit to the accretion rate is\npredicted for the observability of broad emission lines, if the broad line\nregion is associated with an optically thick accretion disk. Thus, true Seyfert\n2 galaxies may exist at very low accretion rates/luminosities. The differences\nbetween BHXRBs and AGNs in the framework of the disk corona model are discussed\nand possible modifications to the model are briefly suggested.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2009 01:27:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

Noting that in the gauge-Higgs unification scenario,\nintroduction of anti-periodic fermions is well-motivated by a phenomenological\nreason, we investigate dark matter physics in the scenario. As an example, we\nconsider a five-dimensional SO(5)$\\timesU(1)_X$ gauge-Higgs unification model\ncompactified on the $S^1/Z_2$ with the warped metric. Due to the structure of\nthe gauge-Higgs unification, interactions between the dark matter particle and\nthe Standard Model particles are largely controlled by the gauge symmetry, and\nhence the model has a strong predictive power for the dark matter physics.\nEvaluating the dark matter relic abundance, we identify a parameter region\nconsistent with the current observations.

The azimuthal and radial components of magnetic fields and\ncurrents have been derived. The azimuthal component of the magnetic field of\nsunspots is found to vary in sign with azimuth. The radial component of the\nfield also varies in magnitude with azimuth. While the latter pattern is a\nconfirmation of the interlocking combed structure of penumbral filaments, the\nformer pattern shows that the penumbra is made up of a \"curly interlocking\ncombed\" magnetic field.

This confirms the confinement of\nmagnetic fields and absence of a net current for sunspots as postulated by\n\\cite{parker96}.

These genuine AGN-core SEDs, mostly from Seyfert galaxies, are\ncharacterised by two main features: an IR bump with the maximum in the 2-10\nmicron range, and an increasing X-ray spectrum in the 1 to ~200 keV region.\nThese dominant features are common to Seyfert type 1 and 2 objects alike. Type\n2 AGN exhibit a sharp drop shortward of 2 micron, with the optical to UV region\nbeing fully absorbed, while type 1s show instead a gentle 2 micron drop ensued\nby a secondary, partially-absorbed optical to UV emission bump. Assuming the\nbulk of optical to UV photons generated in these AGN are reprocessed by dust\nand re-emitted in the IR in an isotropic manner, the IR bump luminosity\nrepresents >70% of the total energy output in these objects while the high\nenergies above 20 keV are the second energetically important contribution.\n  Galaxies selected by their warm IR colours, i.e. presenting a relatively-flat\nflux distribution in the 12 to 60 micron range have often being classified as\nAGN. The results from these high spatial resolution SEDs question this\ncriterion as a general rule. It is found that the intrinsic shape of the IR SED\nof an AGN and inferred bolometric luminosity largely depart from those derived\nfrom large aperture data. AGN luminosities can be overestimated by up to two\norders of magnitude if relying on IR satellite data. We find these differences\nto be critical for AGN luminosities below or about 10^{44} erg/s.

The answer is obtained by measuring only two observables,\nwhich are two state-populations excited via the two- and three-photon\nabsorption processes. Hence, the computational task is accomplished in a\nconstant number of operations irrespective of the sequence length. As such, the\npresented scheme, where the femtosecond pulse serves as a query and the\nirradiated physical system serves as an oracle, provides a sufficient gain in\nthe computational complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2009 10:16:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-21"}

In the CCD, the loci of over 70 - 80% of AGNs can be\ndistinguished from the stellar locus. To examine the colours of quasars, we\nsimulate near-infrared colours using Hyperz code. Assuming a realistic quasar\nSED, we derive simulated near-infrared colours of quasars with redshift (up to\nz ~ 11). The simulated colours can reproduce not only the redshift-colour\nrelations but also the loci of quasars/AGNs in the near-infrared CCD.

We\ncompare the locus of AGNs with the other four types of objects (namely,\nmicroquasars, CVs, LMXBs, and MYSOs) which have a radiation mechanism similar\nto that of AGNs.

Accordingly, it is highly probable that\nthe four types of objects can be distinguished on the basis of the locus in a\nnear-infrared CCD.

We demonstrate that it accommodates the phase space\ndynamics of low dimensional dissipative systems such as the much studied Lorenz\nand R\\\"{o}ssler Strange attractors, as well as the more recent constructions of\nChen and Leipnik-Newton. The rotational, volume preserving part of the flow\npreserves in time a family of two intersecting surfaces, the so called {\\em\nNambu Hamiltonians}. They foliate the entire phase space and are, in turn,\ndeformed in time by Dissipation which represents their irrotational part of the\nflow. It is given by the gradient of a scalar function and is responsible for\nthe emergence of the Strange Attractors.\n  Based on our recent work on Quantum Nambu Mechanics, we provide an explicit\nquantization of the Lorenz attractor through the introduction of\nNon-commutative phase space coordinates as Hermitian $ N \\times N $ matrices in\n$ R^{3}$. They satisfy the commutation relations induced by one of the two\nNambu Hamiltonians, the second one generating a unique time evolution.\nDissipation is incorporated quantum mechanically in a self-consistent way\nhaving the correct classical limit without the introduction of external degrees\nof freedom. Due to its volume phase space contraction it violates the quantum\ncommutation relations. We demonstrate that the Heisenberg-Nambu evolution\nequations for the Quantum Lorenz system give rise to an attracting ellipsoid in\nthe $3 N^{2}$ dimensional phase space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2009 15:38:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2009 16:45:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

In a representative sample of stars earlier\nthan F5 (29 stars), we find a population of 9 stars with a varying degree of\nmoderate 24um excess comparable to those produced by debris disks in older\nstellar groups. As expected in debris disks systems, those stars do not exhibit\nemission lines in their optical spectra. We also include in our study the star\nHD 245185, a known Herbig Ae object which displays excesses in all Spitzer\nbands and shows emission lines in its spectrum. We compare the disk population\nin the Lambda Orionis cluster with the disk census in other stellar groups\nstudied using similar methods to detect and characterize their disks and\nspanning a range of ages from 3 Myr to 10 Myr. We find that for stellar groups\nof 5 Myr or older the observed disk frequency in intermediate mass stars (with\nspectral types from late B to early F) is higher than in low mass stars (with\nspectral types K and M). This is in contradiction with the observed trend for\nprimordial disks evolution, in which stars with higher stellar masses dissipate\ntheir primordial disks faster. At 3 Myr the observed disk frequency in\nintermediate mass stars is still lower than for low mass stars indicating that\nsecond generation dusty disks start to dominate the disk population at 5 Myr\nfor intermediate mass stars. This result agrees with recent models of evolution\nof solids in the region of the disk where icy objects form (>30 AU), which\nsuggest that at 5-10 Myr collisions start to produce large amount of dust\nduring the transition from runaway to oligarchic growth (reaching sizes of ~500\nkm) and then dust production peaks at 10-30 Myr, when objects reach their\nmaximum sizes (>1000 km)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2009 15:50:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

It deals with the creation of Mach cones which\nare supposed to exhibit a characteristic structure in the measured angular\nparticle distributions allowing for direct conclusions about the Equation of\nState and in particular about the speed of sound of the medium. Several\ndifferent scenarios of jet energy loss are examined and different mechanisms of\nenergy and momentum loss are analyzed, ranging from weak interactions (based on\ncalculations from perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics, pQCD) to strong\ninteractions (formulated using the Anti-de-Sitter/Conformal Field Theory\nCorrespondence, AdS/CFT). Though they result in different angular particle\ncorrelations which could in principle allow to distinguish the underlying\nprocesses, it is shown that the characteristic structure observed in\nexperimental data can be obtained due to the different contributions of several\npossible jet trajectories through an expanding medium. Such a structure cannot\ndirectly be connected to the Equation of State. In this context, the impact of\na strong flow created behind the jet (the diffusion wake) is examined which is\ncommon to almost all jet deposition scenarios.
