In this work\nwe analyze theoretically two aspects of ac driven transport in cold atoms\nratchets. We first address the issue of whether, and to which extent, an ac\ndriven ratchet for cold atoms can operate as a motor. We thus study\ntheoretically a dissipative motor for cold atoms, as obtained by adding a load\nto a 1D non-adiabatically driven rocking ratchet. We demonstrate that a current\ncan be generated also in the presence of a load, e.g. the ratchet device can\noperate as a motor. Correspondingly, we determine the stall force for the\nmotor, which characterizes the range of loads over which the device can operate\nas a motor, and the differential mobility, which characterizes the response to\na change in the magnitude of the load. Second, we compare our results for the\ntransport in an ac driven ratchet device with the transport in a dc driven\nsystem. We observe a peculiar phenomenon: the bi-harmonic ac force stabilizes\nthe dynamics, allowing the generation of uniform directed motion over a range\nof momentum much larger than what is possible with a dc bias. We explain such a\nstabilization of the dynamics by observing that a non-adiabatic ac drive\nbroadens the effective cooling momentum range, and forces the atom trajectories\nto cover such a region. Thus the system can dissipate energy and maintain a\nsteady-state energy balance. Our results show that in the case of a\nfinite-range velocity-dependent friction, a ratchet device may offer the\npossibility of controlling the particle motion over a broader range of momentum\nwith respect to a purely biased system, although this is at the cost of a\nreduced coherency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Oct 2009 17:33:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2010 08:30:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-03"}

These data show both broad\n(FWHM = 231 \\pm 21 km/s) and narrow (FWHM <30 km/s) velocity width absorption\ncomponents. The broad velocity absorption shows high opacity on the counter\njet, low opacity against the core and no absorption on the jet side. We argue\nthat these results are most naturally explained by a circumnuclear HI absorbing\ndisk orientated roughly perpendicular to the jet axis. We estimate that the HI\nabsorbing gas lies at a radius of ~80 pc has a scale height of about 20 pc,\ndensity n > 10^{4} cm^{-3} and total column density in the range\n10^{23}-10^{24} cm^{-2}. Models in which the HI absorption is primarily from an\natomic or a molecular gas phase can both fit our data. Modelling taking into\naccount the effective beam shows that the broad HI absorbing gas component does\nnot cover the radio core in Cygnus A and therefore does not contribute to the\ngas column that blocks our view of the hidden quasar nucleus. If however Cygnus\nA were observed from a different direction, disk gas on ~100 pc radius scales\nwould contribute significantly to the nuclear column density, implying that in\nsome radio galaxies gas on these scales may contribute to the obscuration of\nthe central engine. We argue that the circumnuclear torus in Cygnus A contains\ntoo little mass to power the AGN over > 10^{7} yr but that material in the\nouter HI absorbing gas disk can provide a reservoir to fuel the AGN and\nreplenish torus clouds. The second narrow HI absorption component is\nsignificantly redshifted (by 186km/s) with respect to the systemic velocity and\nprobably traces infalling gas which will ultimately fuel the source.

Consequently, concern about\nthe privacy of these data has become a top priority, particularly those data\nthat are created and used in electronic commerce. There have been many\nformulations of privacy and, unfortunately, many negative results about the\nfeasibility of maintaining privacy of sensitive data in realistic networked\nenvironments. We formulate communication-complexity-based definitions, both\nworst-case and average-case, of a problem's privacy-approximation ratio.

Neither the total nor\nthe passive or star-forming MF can be well fit with a single Schechter function\nonce one probes below 3e9 Msun. We observe a dip or plateau at masses ~1e10\nMsun, and an upturn towards a steep faint-end slope of -1.7 at lower mass at\nany z<1. This bimodal nature of the MF is not solely a result of the blue/red\ndichotomy. The blue MF is by itself bimodal at z~1. This suggests a new\ndichotomy in galaxy formation that predates the appearance of the red sequence.\nWe propose two interpretations for this bimodality. If the gas fraction\nincreases towards lower mass, galaxies with M_baryon~1e10 Msun would shift to\nlower stellar masses, creating the observed dip. This would indicate a change\nin star formation efficiency, perhaps linked to supernovae feedback becoming\nmuch more efficient. Therefore, we investigate whether the dip is present in\nthe baryonic (stars+gas) MF. Alternatively, the dip could be created by an\nenhancement of the galaxy assembly rate at ~1e11 Msun, a phenomenon that\nnaturally arises if the baryon fraction peaks at M_halo ~1e12 Msun. In this\nscenario, galaxies occupying the bump around M* would be identified with\ncentral galaxies and the second fainter component having a steep faint-end\nslope with satellites. While the dip is apparent in the total MF at any z, it\nappears to shift from the blue to red population, likely as a result of\ntransforming high-mass blue galaxies into red ones. At the same time, we detect\na drastic upturn in the number of low-mass red galaxies. Their increase with\ntime reflects a decrease in the number of blue systems and so we tentatively\nassociate them with satellite dwarf galaxies that have undergone quenching.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Oct 2009 20:10:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

We find that\nthe black hole spins loose memory of their initial orientation, as accretion\ntorques suffice to align the spins with the angular momentum of their orbit on\na short timescale (<1-2 Myr). A residual off-set in the spin direction relative\nto the orbital angular momentum remains, at the level of <10 degrees for the\ncase of a cold disc, and <30 degrees for a warmer disc. Alignment in a cooler\ndisc is more effective due to the higher coherence of the accretion flow near\neach black hole that reflects the large-scale coherence of the disc's rotation.\nIf the massive black holes coalesce preserving the spin directions set after\nformation of a Keplerian binary, the relic black hole resulting from their\ncoalescence receives a relatively small gravitational recoil. The distribution\nof recoil velocities inferred from a simulated sample of massive black hole\nbinaries has median <70 km/s much smaller than the median resulting from an\nisotropic distribution of spins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Oct 2009 20:20:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2009 21:00:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

In this paper, we\naddress several different aspects of the demanding photo-z performance that\nwill be required for future experiments, such as the proposed ESA Euclid\nmission. It is first shown that the proposed all-sky near-infrared photometry\nfrom Euclid, in combination with anticipated ground-based photometry (e.g.\nPanStarrs-2 or DES) should yield the required precision in individual photo-z\nof sigma(z) < 0.05(1+z) at I_AB < 24.5. Simple a priori rejection schemes based\non the photometry alone can be tuned to recognise objects with wildly\ndiscrepant photo-z and to reduce the outlier fraction to < 0.25% with only\nmodest loss of otherwise usable objects. Turning to the more challenging\nproblem of determining the mean redshift <z> of a set of galaxies to a\nprecision of 0.002(1+z) we argue that, for many different reasons, this is best\naccomplished by relying on the photo-z themselves rather than on the direct\nmeasurement of <z> from spectroscopic redshifts of a representative subset of\nthe galaxies. A simple adaptive scheme based on the statistical properties of\nthe photo-z likelihood functions is shown to meet this stringent systematic\nrequirement. We also examine the effect of an imprecise correction for Galactic\nextinction and the effects of contamination by fainter over-lapping objects in\nphoto-z determination.

In\nparticular, Alice observes an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)\nsource X and wishes to transmit this source losslessly to Bob over a\nrate-limited link. A helper (Helen), observes an i.i.d. correlated source Y and\ncan transmit information to Bob over a separate rate-limited link. A passive\neavesdropper (Eve) can observe the coded output of Alice, i.e., the link from\nAlice to Bob is public. The uncertainty about the source X at Eve, is measured\nby the conditional entropy of the source given the coded output of Alice. We\ncompletely characterize the rate-equivocation region for this secure source\ncoding model, where we show that Slepian-Wolf binning of X with respect to the\ncoded side information received at Bob is optimal. We next consider a\nmodification of this model in which Alice also has access to the coded output\nof Helen. For the two-sided helper model, we characterize the rate-equivocation\nregion. While the availability of side information at Alice does not reduce the\nrate of transmission from Alice, it significantly enhances the resulting\nequivocation at Eve. In particular, the resulting equivocation for the\ntwo-sided helper case is shown to be min(H(X),R_y), i.e., one bit from the\ntwo-sided helper provides one bit of uncertainty at Eve. From this result, we\ninfer that Slepian-Wolf binning of X is suboptimal and one can further decrease\nthe information leakage to the eavesdropper by utilizing the side information\nat Alice.

Resonant x-ray\nscattering (RXS) allows us to perform an accurate investigation of all these\nelectronic degrees. RXS combines high-Q resolution x-ray diffraction with the\nproperties of the resonance providing information similar to that obtained by\natomic spectroscopy (element selectivity and a large enhancement of scattering\namplitude for this particular element and sensitivity to the symmetry of the\nelectronic levels through the multipole electric transitions). Since electronic\nstates are coupled to the local symmetry, RXS reveals the occurrence of\nsymmetry breaking effects such as lattice distortions, onset of electronic\norbital ordering or ordering of electronic charge distributions. We shall\ndiscuss the strength of RXS at the K absorption edge of 3d transition-metal\noxides by describing various applications in the observation of local\nanisotropy and charge disproportionation. Examples of these resonant effects\nare (I) charge ordering transitions in manganites, Fe3O4 and ferrites and (II)\nforbidden reflections and anisotropy in Mn3+ perovskites, spinel ferrites and\ncobalt oxides. In all the studied cases, the electronic (charge and/or\nanisotropy) orderings are determined by the structural distortions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2009 05:38:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Enlightened by the numerical result we speculate that the\nmulti-soliton formation and soliton energy quantization observed in other types\nof soliton fiber lasers could have similar mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2009 08:33:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-02"}

A\nlarge systematic phase drift is also observed in the first discovered AMP SAX\nJ1808.4-3658. To study the origin of these timing features, we use here the\ndata of the well studied 2002 outburst of SAX J1808.4-3658. We develop first a\nmodel for pulse profile formation accounting for the screening of the antipodal\nemitting spot by the accretion disk. We demonstrate that the variations of the\nvisibility of the antipodal spot associated with the receding accretion disk\ncause a systematic shift in Fourier phases, observed together with the changes\nin the pulse form. We show that a strong secondary maximum can be observed only\nin a narrow intervals of inner disk radii, which explains the very short\nappearance of the double-peaked profiles in SAX J1808.4-3658. By directly\nfitting the pulse profile shapes with our model, we find that the main\nparameters of the emitting spot such as its mean latitude and longitude as well\nas the emissivity pattern change irregularly causing small shifts in pulse\nphase, and the strong profile variations are caused by the increasing inner\ndisk radius. We finally notice that significant variations in the pulse\nprofiles in the 2002 and 2008 outbursts of SAX J1808.4-3658 happen at fluxes\ndiffering by a factor of 2, which can be explained if the inner disk radius is\nnot a simple function of the accretion rate, but depends on the previous\nhistory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2009 13:26:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

Using a well-studied example based on the Gold-Hoyle\nequilibrium, it is demonstrated that if the equilibrium sequence is calculated\nusing the Grad-Shafranov equation, the instability corresponds to the second\nbifurcation point and not the first bifurcation point because the equilibrium\nboundary conditions allow for modes which are excluded from the linear ideal\nstability analysis. This is shown by calculating the bifurcating equilibrium\nbranches and comparing the spatial structure of the solutions close to the\nbifurcation point with the spatial structure of the unstable mode. If the\nequilibrium sequence is calculated using Euler potentials the first bifurcation\npoint of the Grad-Shafranov case is not found, and the first bifurcation point\nof the Euler potential description coincides with the ideal instability\nthreshold. An explanation of this results in terms of linear bifurcation theory\nis given and the implications for the use of MHD equilibrium bifurcations to\nexplain eruptive phenomena is briefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2009 15:08:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-17"}

This quantum system, called a quantum knot\nsystem, is physically implementable in the same sense as Shor's quantum\nfactoring algorithm is implementable.\n  To define a quantum knot system, we replace the standard three Reidemeister\nknot moves with an equivalent set of three moves, called respectively wiggle,\nwag, and tug, so named because they mimic how a dog might wag its tail. We\nargue that these moves are in fact more \"physics friendly\" because, unlike the\nReidemeister moves, they respect the differential geometry of 3-space, and\nmoreover they can be transformed into infinitesimal moves.\n  These three moves wiggle, wag, and tug generate a unitary group, called the\nlattice ambient group, which acts on the state space of the quantum system. The\nlattice ambient group represents all possible ways of moving a rope around in\n3-space without cutting the rope, and without letting the rope pass through\nitself.\n  We then investigate those quantum observables of the quantum knot system\nwhich are knot invariants. We also study Hamiltonians associated with the\ngenerators of the lattice ambient group. We conclude with a list of open\nquestions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2009 15:14:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-02"}

Both types of ac driving lead to photon-assisted tunneling where\nquantized amounts of energy are exchanged with the driving field. It is found\nthat the differential-conductance peak due to photon-assisted tunneling does\nnot survive in the Coulomb-blockade regime when the dot is driven by a rotating\nmagnetic field. Furthermore, we generalize the MacDonald formula to calculate\nthe time-averaged noise spectra of ac-driven quantum dots. Besides the peak at\nzero frequency, the noise spectra show additional peaks or dips in the presence\nof an ac field. For the case of an applied ac gate voltage, the peak or dip\nposition is fixed at the driving frequency, whereas the position changes with\nincreasing amplitude for the case of a rotating magnetic field. Additional\nfeatures appear in the noise spectra if a dc magnetic field is applied in\naddition to a rotating field. In all cases, the peak or dip positions can be\nunderstood from the energy differences of two available Floquet channels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2009 15:32:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 2010 01:49:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}
