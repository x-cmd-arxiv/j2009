The effective electron kinetic energy\nthreshold used is T_eff=3.5 MeV, the lowest analysis threshold yet achieved\nwith water Cherenkov detector data. In units of 10^6 cm^{-2} s^{-1}, the total\nflux of active-flavor neutrinos from 8B decay in the Sun measured using the\nneutral current (NC) reaction of neutrinos on deuterons, with no constraint on\nthe 8B neutrino energy spectrum, is found to be Phi_NC = 5.140\n^{+0.160}_{-0.158} (stat) ^{+0.132}_{-0.117} (syst). These uncertainties are\nmore than a factor of two smaller than previously published results. Also\npresented are the spectra of recoil electrons from the charged current reaction\nof neutrinos on deuterons and the elastic scattering of electrons. A fit to the\nSNO data in which the free parameters directly describe the total 8B neutrino\nflux and the energy-dependent nu_e survival probability provides a measure of\nthe total 8B neutrino flux Phi_8B = 5.046 ^{+0.159}_{-0.152} (stat)\n^{+0.107}_{-0.123} (syst). Combining these new results with results of all\nother solar experiments and the KamLAND reactor experiment yields best-fit\nvalues of the mixing parameters of theta_{12}=34.06 ^{+1.16}_{-0.84} degrees\nand Delta m^2_{21}=7.59 ^{+0.20}_{-0.21} x 10^{-5} eV^2.

In the quiescent\nstate, the model is well known for its sluggish dynamics and a two step\nrelaxation of correlation functions at low temperatures. An ideal glass\ntransition temperature of $T_c = 0.435$ has been identified in the previous\nstudies via the analysis of the system's dynamics in the frame work of the mode\ncoupling theory of the glass transition [W. Kob and H.C. Andersen, PRE 51, 4626\n(1995)]. Here, we test wether a signature of this ideal glass transition can\nalso be found under shear. Indeed, the following distinction in the structural\nrelaxation is found: In the supercooled state, the structural relaxation is\ndominated by the shear at relatively high shear rates, $\\dot{\\gamma}$, whereas\nat sufficiently low $\\dot{\\gamma}$ the (shear-independent) equilibrium\nrelaxation is recovered. In contrast to this, the structural relaxation of a\n\\emph{glass} is always driven by shear. This distinct behavior of the\ncorrelation functions is also reflected in the rheological response. In the\nsupercooled state, the shear viscosity, $\\eta$, decreases with increasing shear\nrate (shear thinning) at high shear rates, but then converges toward a constant\nas the $\\dot{\\gamma}$ is decreased below a (temperature-dependent) threshold\nvalue. Below $T_c$, on the other hand, the shear viscosity grows as $\\eta\n\\propto 1/\\dot{\\gamma}$ suggesting a divergence at $\\dot{\\gamma} =0$.

A rising phase is likely present in all GRBs but is usually hidden\nby the prompt tail emission and constitutes the first manifestation of what is\nlater to give rise to the shallow decay phase. Contemporaneous optical\nobservations reveal a rapid evolution of the injection frequency of a fast\ncooling synchrotron spectrum through the optical band, which disfavours the\nafterglow onset (start of the forward shock emission along our line of sight\nwhen the outflow is decelerated) as the origin of the observed re-brightening.\nWe investigate alternative scenarios and find that the observations are\nconsistent with the predictions for a narrow jet viewed off-axis. The high\non-axis energy budget implied by this interpretation suggests different\nphysical origins of the prompt and (late) afterglow emission. Strong spectral\nsoftening takes place from the prompt to the steep decay phase: we track the\nevolution of the spectral peak energy from the gamma-rays to the X-rays and\nhighlight the problems of the high latitude and adiabatic cooling\ninterpretations. Notably, a softening of both the high and low spectral slopes\nwith time is also observed.

Depending on the magnitude of phase difference between the\nfore- and hind-wings of dragonfly, the vortical structures and their\ninteraction with wings become significantly changed, and so does the\naerodynamic performance. In this study, we consider hovering flights of\nmodelled dragonfly with three different phase differences (phi=-90, 90, 180\ndegrees). The three-dimensional wing shape is based on that of Aeschna juncea\n(Norberg, 1972), and the Reynolds number is 1,000 based on the maximum\ntranslational velocity and mean chord length. The numerical method is based on\nan immersed boundary method (Kim et al., 2001). In counter-stroke (phi=180\ndegree), the wing-tip vortices from both wings are connected in the wake,\ngenerating an entangled wing-tip vortex (e-WTV). A strong downward motion\ninduced by this vortex decreases the lift force in the following downstroke\n(Kweon and Choi, 2008). When the fore-wing leads the hind-wing (phi=90 degree),\nthe hind-wing is submerged in the vortices generated by the fore-wing and\nsuffers from their induced downwash flow throughout the downstroke, resulting\nin a significant reduction of lift force. On the other hand, when the hind-wing\nleads the fore-wing (phi=-90 degree), the e-WTV is found only near the start of\nhind-wing upstroke. In the following downstroke of hind-wing, most of the e-WTV\ndisappears and the hind-wing is little affected by this vortex, which produces\nrelatively large lift force.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 2009 19:20:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-19"}

We focus\nour analysis in large scale anisotropies. At these angular scales, the\nnon-Gaussian description proposed in this work defaults (under certain\nconditions) to an approximated local form of the weak non-linear coupling\ninflationary model. In particular, quadratic and cubic terms are governed by\nthe non-linear coupling parameters f_nl and g_nl, respectively. The extension\nproposed in this paper allows us to directly constrain these non-linear\nparameters. Applying the proposed methodology to WMAP 5-yr data, we obtain -5.6\nx 10^5 < g_nl < 6.4 x 10^5, at 95% CL. This result is in agreement with\nprevious findings obtained for equivalent non-Gaussian models and with\ndifferent non-Gaussian estimators. A model selection test is performed,\nindicating that a Gaussian model is preferred to the non-Gaussian scenario.\nWhen comparing different non-Gaussian models, we observe that a pure f_nl model\nis the most favoured case, and that a pure g_nl model is more likely than a\ngeneral non-Gaussian scenario. Finally, we have analyzed the WMAP data in two\nindependent hemispheres, in particular the ones defined by the dipolar pattern\nfound by Hoftuft et al. 2009. We show that, whereas g_nl is still compatible\nwith zero for both hemispheres, it is not the case for f_nl (with a p-value\n0.04). However, if anisotropy of the data is assumed, the distance between the\nlikelihood distributions for each hemisphere is larger than expected from\nGaussian and anisotropic simulations, also for g_nl (with a p-value of 0.001 in\nthe case of this parameter).

We select dEs in a\n(projected) region around the central elliptical galaxies, and subdivide them\nby their line-of-sight velocity into fast-moving and slow-moving ones.

We conclude that the round dEs probably are on\ncircularized orbits, while the flat dEs are still on more eccentric or radial\norbits typical for an infalling population. In this picture, the round dEs\nwould have resided in the cluster already for a long time, or would even be a\ncluster-born species, explaining their nearly circular orbits.

For residential construction, such failures are usually\nassociated with roofs, which see the largest aerodynamic loading. However,\ndetermining aerodynamic loads on different portions of North American houses is\ncomplicated by the lack of clear load paths and non-linear load sharing in wood\nframe roofs. This problem of fluid-structure interaction requires both wind\ntunnel testing and full-scale structural testing.\n  A series of wind tunnel tests have been performed on a house in a simulated\natmospheric boundary layer (ABL), with the resulting wind-induced pressures\napplied to the full-scale structure. The ABL was simulated for flow over open\ncountry terrain where both velocity and turbulence intensity profiles, as well\nas spectra, were matched with available full scale measurements for this type\nof terrain. The first set of measurements was 600 simultaneous surface pressure\nmeasurements over the entire house.\n  A key feature of the surface pressure field is the occurrence of large,\nhighly non-Gaussian, peak uplift (suctions) on the roof. In order to better\nunderstand which flow features cause this, PIV experiments were performed on\nthe wind tunnel model. These experiments were performed with time-resolved PIV\n(sampling rate of 500 Hz) for a duration of 30 seconds. From the fluid dynamics\nvideos (low- and high-resolution) generated from the PIV data it is clear that\nstrong circulation is generated at the windward edge of the roof.

This MAPK activity is characterized by two wave-like\nphenomena. One MAPK \"wave\" that originates immediately after injury, propagates\ndeep into the cell layer, and then rebounds back to the wound interface. After\nthis initial MAPK activity has largely disappeared, a second MAPK front\npropagates slowly from the wound interface and continues into the tissue,\nmaintaining a sustained level of MAPK activity throughout the cell layer. It\nhas been suggested that the first wave is initiated by reactive oxygen species\n(ROS) generated at the time of injury. In this paper, we develop a minimal\nmechanistic diffusion-convection model that reproduces the observed behavior.\nThe main ingredients of our model are a competition between ligand (e.g.,\nEpithelial Growth Factor) and ROS for the activation of Epithelial Growth\nFactor Receptor (EGFR) and a second MAPK wave that is sustained by stresses\ninduced by the slow cell movement that closes the wound.

This intrinsic anisotropy originate from\ndifferent boundary condition at ribbon edges, and can be used to tune thermal\nconductance, which have important implications for the applications of GNRs in\nnanoelectronics and thermoelectricity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Oct 2009 02:52:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

As the nematic mesogens become more\nordered when the gel is cooled down from a higher gelation temperature, the\npolymeric backbones tend to elongate along the direction parallel to the\nnematic director, which is perpendicular to the rigid glass surfaces in the\nexperimental setup.

Once the drop reaches the bottom of the container, it sticks to the\nsurface with a certain contact angle. Then, a part of the drop vaporizes: the\nnucleation point may appear at the wall, the interface or the bulk of the drop.\nThe vapor expands inside the drop and deforms its interface. The way in which\nthe vapor expands, either smooth or violent, depends on the location of the\nnucleation point and oil temperature.

It is hold the attitude that the symmetries of quantum theory are the\norigin of both sorts of symmetries in nature. Since all quantum states can be\nrepresented as a tensor product of two dimensional quantum objects, called ur\nobjects, which can be interpreted as quantum bits of information, described by\nspinors reflecting already the symmetry properties of space-time, it seems to\nbe possible to justify such an attitude. According to this, space-time\nsymmetries can be considered as a consequence of a representation of quantum\nstates by quantum bits. Internal symmetries are assumed to refer to relations\nof such fundamental objects, which are contained within the state of one single\nparticle, with respect to each other. In this sense the existence of space-time\nsymmetries, the existence of internal symmetries and their division could\nobtain a derivation from quantum theory interpreted as a theory of information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Oct 2009 13:53:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-20"}
