Excellent\nagreement with experiment is obtained for whole salt hydration free energies\nusing the polarizable AMOEBA force field. The quasi-chemical approach exactly\npartitions the solvation free energy into inner-shell, outer-shell packing, and\nouter-shell long-ranged contributions by means of a hard-sphere condition.\nSmall conditioning radii, even well inside the first maximum of the\nion-water(oxygen) radial distribution function, result in Gaussian behavior for\nthe long-ranged contribution that dominates the ion hydration free energy. The\nspatial partitioning allows for a mean-field treatment of the long-ranged\ncontribution, leading to a natural division into first-order electrostatic,\ninduction, and van der Waals terms.

The\ncalculations are performed on an ensemble of configurations obtained from\nmolecular dynamics simulations of a single chloride ion in bulk water. The\nsimulations utilize the polarizable AMOEBA force field for trajectory\ngeneration, and MP2-level calculations are performed to examine the electronic\nstructure properties of the ions and surrounding waters in the external field\nof more distant waters. The ChelpG method is employed to explore the effective\ncharges and dipoles on the chloride ions and first-shell waters. The Quantum\nTheory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) is further utilized to examine charge\ntransfer from the anion to surrounding water molecules.\n  From the QTAIM analysis, 0.2 elementary charges are transferred from the ion\nto the first-shell water molecules. The default AMOEBA model overestimates the\naverage dipole moment magnitude of the ion compared with the estimated quantum\nmechanical value. The average magnitude of the dipole moment of the water\nmolecules in the first shell treated at the MP2 level, with the more distant\nwaters handled with an AMOEBA effective charge model, is 2.67 D. This value is\nclose to the AMOEBA result for first-shell waters (2.72 D) and is slightly\nreduced from the bulk AMOEBA value (2.78 D). The magnitude of the dipole moment\nof the water molecules in the first solvation shell is most strongly affected\nby the local water-water interactions and hydrogen bonds with the second\nsolvation shell, rather than by interactions with the ion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2009 16:58:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2009 16:45:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

One can understand (and ultimately control) the material's ground\nstate by associating features and regions of the phase diagram, with specific\nphysical events or underlying quantum mechanical properties. The phase diagram\nof the newly discovered iron arsenic high temperature superconductors is\nparticularly rich and interesting. In the AE(Fe1-xTx)2As2 class (AE being Ca,\nSr, Ba, T being transition metals), the simultaneous structural/magnetic phase\ntransition that occurs at elevated temperature in the undoped material, splits\nand is suppressed by carrier doping, the suppression being complete around\noptimal doping. A dome of superconductivity exists with apparent equal ease in\nthe orthorhombic / antiferromagnetic (AFM) state as well as in the tetragonal\nstate with no long range magnetic order. The question then is what determines\nthe critical doping at which superconductivity emerges, if the AFM order is\nfully suppressed only at higher doping values. Here we report evidence from\nangle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) that critical changes in the\nFermi surface (FS) occur at the doping level that marks the onset of\nsuperconductivity.

The normalized radial distribution of all CCSNe is consistent\nwith an exponential law, with a possible depletion of CCSNe within one-fifth of\nthe isophotal radius. The scale length of the distribution of type II SNe\nappears to be significantly larger than that of the stellar disks of their host\ngalaxies, but consistent with the scale lengths of Freeman disks.

The radial distribution of type Ib/c SNe is more\ncentrally concentrated than that of the stars in a Freeman disk, but is similar\nto the stellar disk distribution that we infer for the host galaxies. The scale\nlength of the CCSN radial distribution shows no significant correlation with\nthe host galaxy morphological type, or the presence of bars.

The class of building-free graphs contains many\ninteresting classes of perfect graphs such as Meyniel graphs which, in turn,\ncontains classes such as hhd-free graphs, i-triangulated graphs, and parity\ngraphs. Moreover, there are imperfect graphs that are building-free. The class\nof building-free graphs generalizes several classes of graphs for which an\nefficient test for the presence of a sun is known. We also present a vertex\nelimination scheme for the class of (building, gem)-free graphs. The class of\n(building, gem)-free graphs is a generalization of the class of distance\nhereditary graphs and a restriction of the class of (building, sun)-free\ngraphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2009 18:11:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-12"}

Several ground-based spectral line surveys have been made, but\ndue to the absorption by water and oxygen, the terrestrial atmosphere is\ncompletely opaque at frequencies around 487 and 557 GHz. To cover these\nfrequencies we used the Odin satellite to perform a spectral line survey in the\nfrequency ranges 486-492 GHz and 541-577 GHz, filling the gaps between previous\nspectral scans. Odin's high main beam efficiency and observations performed\noutside the atmosphere make our intensity scale very well determined.

In the most general form of the ASEP with open boundaries,\nparticles may enter and exit at the left with probabilities alpha and gamma,\nand they may exit and enter at the right with probabilities beta and delta. In\nthe bulk, the probability of hopping left is q times the probability of hopping\nright. The first main result of this paper is a combinatorial formula for the\nstationary distribution of the ASEP with all parameters general, in terms of a\nnew class of tableaux which we call staircase tableaux.

A bolometric interferometer will have to take\nadvantage of the wide spectral detection band of its bolometers in order to be\ncompetitive with imaging experiments. A crucial concern is that interferometers\nare presumed to be importantly affected by a spoiling effect known as bandwidth\nsmearing. In this paper, we investigate how the bandwidth modifies the work\nprinciple of a bolometric interferometer and how it affects its sensitivity to\nthe CMB angular power spectra. We obtain analytical expressions for the\nbroadband visibilities measured by broadband heterodyne and bolometric\ninterferometers. We investigate how the visibilities must be reconstructed in a\nbroadband bolometric interferometer and show that this critically depends on\nhardware properties of the modulation phase shifters. Using an angular power\nspectrum estimator accounting for the bandwidth, we finally calculate the\nsensitivity of a broadband bolometric interferometer. A numerical simulation\nhas been performed and confirms the analytical results. We conclude (i) that\nbroadband bolometric interferometers allow broadband visibilities to be\nreconstructed whatever the kind of phase shifters used and (ii) that for\ndedicated B-mode bolometric interferometers, the sensitivity loss due to\nbandwidth smearing is quite acceptable, even for wideband instruments (a factor\n2 loss for a typical 20% bandwidth experiment).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2009 21:30:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Queuing\nconstraints are imposed as limitations on buffer violation probabilities. The\nperformance under such constraints is captured through the effective capacity\nformulation. A detailed analysis of the effective capacity is carried out in\nthe low-power, wideband, and high--signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. In the\nlow-power analysis, expressions for the first and second derivatives of the\neffective capacity with respect to SNR at SNR= 0 are obtained under various\nassumptions on the degree of channel state information at the transmitter.\nTransmission strategies that are optimal in the sense of achieving the first\nand second derivatives are identified.

The analysis shows that perturbations from an almost\nmassless auxiliary field generically produce large values of the non-linear\nparameter f_NL. The effects of including non-Gaussian correlation functions in\nthe statistics of cosmological structure are explored by constructing a\nnon-Gaussian probability distribution function (PDF). Such PDF is derived for\nthe comoving curvature perturbation from first principles in the context of\nquantum field theory, with n-point correlation functions as the only input. The\nnon-Gaussian PDF is then used to explore two important problems in the physics\nof primordial black holes (PBHs): First, to compute non-Gaussian corrections to\nthe number of PBHs generated from the primordial curvature fluctuations. The\nsecond application concerns new cosmological observables. The formation of PBHs\nis known to depend on two main physical characteristics: the strength of the\ngravitational field produced by the initial curvature inhomogeneity and the\npressure gradient at the edge of the curvature configuration. We account for\nthe probability of finding these configurations by using two parameters: The\namplitude of the inhomogeneity and its second radial derivative, evaluated at\nthe centre of the configuration. The implications of the derived probability\nfor the fraction of mass in the universe in the form of PBHs are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2009 23:17:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-13"}

We identify 12 CTTS and 2 WTTS as members of NGC 7023, with\nmean age of 1.6 Myr. The 13 PMS stars associated with L1228 belong to three\nsmall aggregates: RNO 129, L1228A, and L1228S. The age distribution of the 17\nPMS stars associated with L1251 suggests that star formation has propagated\nwith the expansion of the Cepheus flare shell. We detect sparse aggregates of\n6-7 Myr old PMS stars around the dark clouds L1177 and L1219, at a distance of\n400 pc. Three T Tauri stars appear to be associated with the Herbig Ae star SV\nCep at a distance of 600 pc. Our results confirm that the molecular complex in\nthe Cepheus flare region contains clouds of various distances and star forming\nhistories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Oct 2009 02:44:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

SN 2007gi reached a $B$-band peak magnitude of\n13.25$\\pm$0.04 mag with a decline rate of $\\Delta m_{15}(B)$(true) =\n1.33$\\pm$0.09 mag. The $B$-band light curve of SN 2007gi demonstrated an\ninteresting two-stage evolution during the nebular phase, with a decay rate of\n1.16$\\pm$0.05 mag (100 days)$^{-1}$ during $t = 60$--90 days and 1.61$\\pm0.04$\nmag (100 days)$^{-1}$ thereafter. Such a behavior was also observed in the HV\nSN Ia 2006X, and might be caused by the interaction between supernova ejecta\nand circumstellar material (CSM) around HV SNe Ia. Based on a sample of a dozen\nwell-observed $R$-band (or unfiltered) light curves of SNe Ia, we confirm that\nthe HV events may have a faster rise time to maximum than the ones with normal\n$v_{\\rm exp}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Oct 2009 11:26:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Here, we present a theoretical study of the chemistry of\ninterstellar molecules containing the halogen elements chlorine and fluorine.\nWe have modeled both diffuse and dense molecular clouds, making use of updated\nestimates for the rates of several key chemical processes. We present\npredictions for the abundances of the three halogen molecules that have been\ndetected to date in the interstellar medium: HF, CF+ and HCl. As in our\nprevious study of fluorine-bearing interstellar molecules, we predict HF to be\nthe dominant gas-phase reservoir of fluorine within both diffuse and dense\nmolecular clouds; we expect the Herschel Space Observatory to detect widespread\nabsorption in the HF J=1-0 transition. Our updated model now overpredicts the\nCF+ abundance by a factor ~10 relative to observations of the Orion Bar; this\ndiscrepancy has widened because we now adopt a laboratory measurement of the\nCF+ dissociative recombination rate that is smaller than the estimate we\nadopted previously. This disagreement suggests that the reaction of C+ with HF\nproceeds more slowly than the capture rate assumed in our model; a laboratory\nmeasurement of this reaction rate would be very desirable. Our model predicts\ndiffuse cloud HCl abundances that are similar to those predicted previously and\ndetected tentatively toward zeta Oph. Two additional species are potentially\ndetectable from photodissociation regions: the H2Cl+ and HCl+ molecular ions.\nOrtho-H2Cl+ has its lowest-lying transition in the millimeter spectral region\nobservable from the ground, and the lowest rotational transition of HCl+ is\nobservable with Herschel's HIFI instrument.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Oct 2009 15:37:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}
