Magnetars' crustal\nmagnetic fields are much stronger than their surface fields; therefore,\nmagnetic pressure partially supports the crust against gravity. The crust loses\nmagnetic pressure support as the field decays and must compensate by increasing\nthe electron degeneracy pressure; the accompanying increase in the electron\nFermi energy induces nonequilibrium, exothermic electron captures. The total\nheat released via field-decay electron captures is comparable to the total\nmagnetic energy in the crust. Thus, field-decay electron captures are an\nimportant, if not the primary, mechanism powering magnetars' soft X-ray\nemission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2009 18:23:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2009 22:33:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Its embedded optical\nsensors detect Cherenkov light from charged particles produced in neutrino\ninteractions in the ice. For several years IceCube has been detecting muon\ntracks from charged-current muon neutrino interactions. However, IceCube has\nyet to observe the electromagnetic or hadronic particle showers or \"cascades\"\ninitiated by charged-current or neutral-current neutrino interactions. The\nfirst detection of such an event signature is expected to come from the known\nflux of atmospheric electron and muon neutrinos.\n  A search for atmospheric neutrino-induced cascades was performed using 275.46\ndays of data from IceCube's 22-string configuration. Reconstruction and\nbackground rejection techniques were developed to reach, for the first time, a\nsignal-to-background ratio ~1. Above a reconstructed energy of 5 TeV, 12\ncandidate events were observed in the full dataset. The signal expectation from\nthe canonical Bartol atmospheric neutrino flux model is 5.63+-2.25 events,\nwhile the expectation from the atmospheric neutrino flux as measured by\nIceCube's predecessor array AMANDA is 7.48 +- 1.50 events. Quoted errors\ninclude the uncertainty on the flux only.\n  While a conclusive detection can not yet be claimed because of a lack of\nbackground Monte Carlo statistics, the evidence that we are at the level of\nbackground suppression needed to see atmospheric neutrino-induced cascades is\nstrong. In addition, one extremely interesting candidate event of energy 133\nTeV survives all cuts and shows an intriguing double pulse structure in its\nwaveforms that may signal the \"double bang\" of a tau neutrino interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2009 18:55:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-15"}

This is the largest sample of GRB\nafterglow spectral energy distributions thus far studied, providing a strong\nhandle on the optical depth distribution of soft X-ray absorption and\ndust-extinction systems in GRB host galaxies. We detect an absorption system\nwithin the GRB host galaxy in 79% of the sample, and an extinction system in\n71% of the sample, and find the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) extinction law to\nprovide an acceptable fit to the host galaxy extinction profile for the\nmajority of cases, consistent with previous findings. The range in the soft\nX-ray absorption to dust-extinction ratio, N_{H,X}/Av, in GRB host galaxies\nspans almost two orders of magnitude, and the typical ratios are significantly\nlarger than those of the Magellanic Clouds or Milky Way. Although dust\ndestruction could be a cause, at least in part, for the large N_{H,X}/Av\nratios, the good fit provided by the SMC extinction law for the majority of our\nsample suggests that there is an abundance of small dust grains in the GRB\nenvironment, which we would expect to have been destroyed if dust destruction\nwere responsible for the large N_{H,X}/Av ratios. Instead, our analysis\nsuggests that the distribution of N_{H,X}/Av in GRB host galaxies may be mostly\nintrinsic to these galaxies, and this is further substantiated by evidence for\na strong negative correlation between N_{H,X}/Av and metallicity for a\nsubsample of GRB hosts with known metallicity. Furthermore, we find the\nN_{H,X}/Av ratio and metallicity for this subsample of GRBs to be comparable to\nthe relation found in other more metal-rich galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2009 18:16:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Sometimes they evolve by adding new\nfeatures, and sometimes by either fixing bugs or replacing outdated\nimplementations with new ones. When software engineers fail to anticipate such\nevolution during development, they will eventually be forced to re-architect or\nre-build from scratch. Therefore, it has been common practice to prepare for\nchanges so that software products are extensible over their lifetimes. However,\nmaking software extensible is challenging because it is difficult to anticipate\nsuccessive changes and to provide adequate abstraction mechanisms over\npotential changes. Such extensibility mechanisms, furthermore, should not\ncompromise any existing functionality during extension. Software engineers\nwould benefit from a tool that provides a way to add extensions in a reliable\nway. It is natural to expect programming languages to serve this role.\nExtensible programming is one effort to address these issues.\n  In this thesis, we present type safe extensible programming using the MLPolyR\nlanguage. MLPolyR is an ML-like functional language whose type system provides\ntype-safe extensibility mechanisms at several levels. After presenting the\nlanguage, we will show how these extensibility mechanisms can be put to good\nuse in the context of product line engineering.

The impact of\nplasma on the stellar surface from magnetospheric accretion streams is likely\nto be a dominant source of energy and momentum in the upper atmospheres of\nthese stars. This paper presents a set of models for the dynamics and heating\nof three distinct regions on T Tauri stars that are affected by accretion: (1)\nthe shocked plasmas directly beneath the magnetospheric accretion streams, (2)\nstellar winds that are accelerated along open magnetic flux tubes, and (3)\nclosed magnetic loops that resemble the Sun's coronal active regions. For the\nloops, a self-consistent model of coronal heating was derived from numerical\nsimulations of solar field-line tangling and turbulent dissipation. Individual\nmodels are constructed for the properties of 14 well-observed stars in the\nTaurus-Auriga star-forming region. Predictions for the wind mass loss rates\nare, on average, slightly lower than the observations, which suggests that disk\nwinds or X-winds may also contribute to the measured outflows. For some of the\nstars, however, the modeled stellar winds do appear to contribute significantly\nto the measured mass fluxes. Predictions for X-ray luminosities from the shocks\nand loops are in general agreement with existing observations. The stars with\nthe highest accretion rates tend to have X-ray luminosities dominated by the\nhigh-temperature (5-10 MK) loops. The X-ray luminosities for the stars having\nlower accretion rates are dominated by the cooler accretion shocks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2009 18:34:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

The accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of a white dwarf (WD) may\nlead to the formation of a protoneutron star and a collapse-driven supernova\nexplosion. This process represents a path alternative to thermonuclear\ndisruption of accreting white dwarfs in Type Ia supernovae. Neutrino and\ngravitational-wave (GW) observations may provide crucial information necessary\nto reveal a potential AIC. Motivated by the need for systematic predictions of\nthe GW signature of AIC, we present results from an extensive set of\ngeneral-relativistic AIC simulations using a microphysical finite-temperature\nequation of state and an approximate treatment of deleptonization during\ncollapse. Investigating a set of 114 progenitor models in rotational\nequilibrium, with a wide range of rotational configurations, temperatures and\ncentral densities, we extend previous Newtonian studies and find that the GW\nsignal has a generic shape akin to what is known as a \"Type III\" signal in the\nliterature. We discuss the detectability of the emitted GWs, showing that the\nsignal-to-noise ratio for current or next-generation interferometer detectors\ncould be high enough to detect such events in our Galaxy. Some of our AIC\nmodels form massive quasi-Keplerian accretion disks after bounce. In rapidly\ndifferentially rotating models, the disk mass can be as large as ~0.8-Msun.\nSlowly and/or uniformly rotating models produce much smaller disks. Finally, we\nfind that the postbounce cores of rapidly spinning white dwarfs can reach\nsufficiently rapid rotation to develop a nonaxisymmetric rotational\ninstability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2009 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-06"}

One\nset of nodal BEC wavefunctions resembles the single particle n node bound state\nwavefunction of the potential well, the other wavefunctions resemble the n-1\nnode bound-state wavefunction with a kink state pinned by the potential. The\nsecond state, though corresponding to the lower free energy value of the pair\nof n node BEC states, is always unstable, whereas the first can be dynamically\nstable in intervals of the potential well depth, implying that the standing\nwave BEC can evolve from a dynamically unstable to stable, and back to unstable\nstatus as the potential well is adiabatically deepened, a phenomenon that we\nrefer to as \"reentrant dynamical stability\".\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2009 20:15:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2009 18:26:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-24"}

A popular explanation for this size evolution is that ETGs grow\nthrough dissipationless (\"dry\") mergers, thus becoming less compact. Combining\nN-body simulations with up-to-date scaling relations of local ETGs, we show\nthat such an explanation is problematic, because dry mergers do not decrease\nthe galaxy stellar-mass surface-density enough to explain the observed size\nevolution, and also introduce substantial scatter in the scaling relations.\nBased on our set of simulations, we estimate that major and minor dry mergers\nincrease half-light radius and projected velocity dispersion with stellar mass\n(M) as M^(1.09+/-0.29) and M^(0.07+/-0.11), respectively. This implies that: 1)\nif the high-z ETGs are indeed as dense as estimated, they cannot evolve into\npresent-day ETGs via dry mergers; 2) present-day ETGs cannot have assembled\nmore than ~45% of their stellar mass via dry mergers. Alternatively, dry\nmergers could be reconciled with the observations if there was extreme fine\ntuning between merger history and galaxy properties, at variance with our\nassumptions. Full cosmological simulations will be needed to evaluate whether\nthis fine-tuned solution is acceptable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2009 21:35:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}

The recent\nexperimental discovery of an anomalous integer quantum Hall effect in graphene\nhas opened up a new avenue in the study of correlated 2D electronic systems, in\nwhich the interacting electron wavefunctions are those of massless chiral\nfermions.

Analyzing the stellar absorption lines,\nnamely, the CaII H & K and Balmer H lines in the optical spectrum, we derive\nthe upper limits of an age for the stellar population. Given this constraint,\nthe minimum {chi}^2 method is used to fit the stellar population models to the\nobserved SED from 0.44 to 5.8um. We find the following properties. The stellar\npopulation has an age 40 - 200 Myr with a metallicity 2.5 Z_{sun}. The\nstarlight is reddened by E(B-V) = 0.8. The reddening is caused by the\nforeground dust screen, indicating that dust is depleted in the starburst site\nand the starburst site is surrounded by a dust shell. The infrared (8-1000um)\nluminosity is L_{ir} = 1.78 +/- 0.63 * 10^{12} L_{sun}. This is two times\ngreater than that expected from the observed starlight, suggesting either that\n1/2 of the starburst site is completely obscured at UV-optical wavelengths, or\nthat 1/2 of L_{ir} comes from AGN emission. The inferred dust mass is 2.0 +/-\n1.0 * 10^8 M_{sun}. This is sufficient to form a shell surrounding the galaxy\nwith an optical depth E(B-V) = 0.8. From our best stellar population model - an\ninstantaneous starburst with an age 40 Myr, we infer the rate of 19\nsupernovae(SNe) per year. Simply analytical models imply that 2.5 Z_{sun} in\nstars was reached when the gas mass reduced to 30% of the galaxy mass. The gas\nmetallcity is 4.8 Z_{sun} at this point.

Hard sphere particles are polystyrene microgels swollen in a good\nsolvent (radius a=380nm, starting volume fraction 0.534) with the short ranged\nattractions induced by the presence of short polymer chains (radius of gyration\nrg = 3nm, starting volume fraction 0.0224). After crystallization, stacking\nfaulted face centred cubic crystals coexist with about 5% of melt remaining in\nthe grain boundaries. From the Bragg scattering signal we infer the amount of\ncrystalline material, the average crystallite size and the number density of\ncrystals as a function of time. This allows to discriminate an early stage of\nconversion, followed by an extended coarsening stage. The small angle\nscattering (SALS) appears only long after completed conversion and exhibits\nFurukawa scaling for all times. Additional microscopic experiments reveal that\nthe grain boundaries have a reduced Bragg scattering power but possess an\nincreased refractive index. Fits of the Furukawa function indicate that the\ndimensionality of the scatterers decreases from 2.25 at short times to 1.65 at\nlate times and the characteristic length scale is slightly larger than the\naverage crystallite size. Together this suggests the SALS signal is due\nscattering from a foam like grain boundary network as a whole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2009 09:10:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-09"}

The present evolution of the Universe is\ndescribed very accurately by the standard Lambda-CDM scenario, while very\nlittle is known about the early cosmological eras. String theory provides a\nconsistent microscopic theory to account for such missing epochs. In our\nframework, the Universe is a torus filled with a gas of superstrings. We first\nshow how to describe the thermodynamical properties of this system, namely\nenergy density and pressure, by introducing temperature and supersymmetry\nbreaking effects at a fundamental level by appropriate boundary conditions.\n  We focus on the intermediate period of the history: After the very early\n\"Hagedorn era\" and before the late electroweak phase transition. We determine\nthe back-reaction of the gas of strings on the initially static space-time,\nwhich then yields the induced cosmology. The consistency of our approach is\nguaranteed by checking the quasi-staticness of the evolution. It turns out that\nfor arbitrary initial boundary conditions at the exit of the Hagedorn era, the\nquasi-static evolutions are universally attracted to radiation-dominated\nsolutions. It is shown that at these attractor points, the temperature, the\ninverse scale factor of the Universe and the supersymmetry breaking scale\nevolve proportionally. There are two important effects which result from the\nunderlying string description. First, initially small internal dimensions can\nbe spontaneously decompactified during the attraction to a radiation dominated\nUniverse. Second, the radii of internal dimensions can be stabilized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2009 14:15:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-05"}

As a factor graph tool, EM may be used to break\ncycles in a factor graph, and tractable messages may in some cases be obtained\nwhere the sum-product messages are unwieldy.\n  As an exemplary application, the paper considers linear Gaussian state space\nmodels. Unknown coefficients in such models give rise to multipliers in the\ncorresponding factor graph. A main attraction of EM in such cases is that it\nresults in purely Gaussian message passing algorithms. These Gaussian EM\nmessages are tabulated for several (scalar, vector, matrix) multipliers that\nfrequently appear in applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2009 10:26:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-16"}

The replica\napproach presented here is a first principle's approach which aims at deriving\nthe main glass properties from the microscopic Hamiltonian. In contrast to the\nold use of replicas in the theory of disordered systems, this replica approach\napplies also to systems without quenched disorder (in this sense, replicas have\nnothing to do with computing the average of a logarithm of the partition\nfunction). It has the advantage of describing in an unified setting both the\nbehaviour near the dynamic transition (mode coupling transition) and the\nbehaviour near the equilibrium `transition' (Kauzmann transition) that is\npresent in fragile glasses. The replica method may be used to solve simple mean\nfield models, providing explicit examples of systems that may be studied\nanalytically in great details and behave similarly to the experiments. Finally,\nusing the replica formalism and some well adapted approximation schemes, it is\npossible to do explicit analytic computations of the properties of realistic\nmodels of glasses.

The\nsimplicity of FISH has been achieved by the rigorous application of the\noperator splitting technique, while second order accuracy is maintained by the\nsymmetric ordering of the operators. Between directional sweeps, the\nthree-dimensional data is rotated in memory so that the sweep is always\nperformed in a cache-efficient way along the direction of contiguous memory.\nHence, the code only requires a one-dimensional description of the conservation\nequations to be solved. This approach also enable an elegant novel\nparallelisation of the code that is based on persistent communications with MPI\nfor cubic domain decomposition on machines with distributed memory. This scheme\nis then combined with an additional OpenMP parallelisation of different sweeps\nthat can take advantage of clusters of shared memory. We document the detailed\nimplementation of a second order TVD advection scheme based on flux\nreconstruction. The magnetic fields are evolved by a constrained transport\nscheme. We show that the subtraction of a simple estimate of the hydrostatic\ngradient from the total gradients can significantly reduce the dissipation of\nthe advection scheme in simulations of gravitationally bound hydrostatic\nobjects. Through its simplicity and efficiency, FISH is as well-suited for\nhydrodynamics classes as for large-scale astrophysical simulations on\nhigh-performance computer clusters. In preparation for the release of a public\nversion, we demonstrate the performance of FISH in a suite of astrophysically\norientated test cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2009 12:37:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-11"}

Here we show that in addition, large classes of spherically\nsymmetric initial data have solutions to the Jang equation which blow up at\nnon-outermost MOTSs, i.e. MOTSs which lie strictly inside of other MOTS, and\neven inside of strictly outer trapped surfaces.

Secondly, an unpublished result of R.\nSchoen, whose proof we include here, says that in the time-symmetric case, any\nMOTS corresponding to a blow-up solution for Jang's equation must be\nouter-area-minimizing, i.e. cannot be contained in a surface of strictly\nsmaller area.

We study the effect of\nthe presence of helium on the time damping of non-adiabatic MHD waves in a\nplasma composed by electrons, protons, neutral hydrogen, neutral helium (He I),\nand singly ionized helium (He II) in the single-fluid approximation. The\ndispersion relation of linear non-adiabatic MHD waves in a homogeneous,\nunbounded, and partially ionized prominence medium is derived.

A\nparametric study of the ratio of the damping time to the period with respect to\nthe helium abundance is performed. The efficiency of ion-neutral collisions as\nwell as thermal conduction is increased by the presence of helium.

A solution of average-time games is presented using a reduction to\naverage-price game on a finite graph. A direct consequence is an elementary\nproof of determinacy for average-time games. This complements our results for\nreachability-time games and partially solves a problem posed by Bouyer et al.,\nto design an algorithm for solving average-price games on priced timed\nautomata. The paper also establishes the exact computational complexity of\nsolving average-time games: the problem is EXPTIME-complete for timed automata\nwith at least two clocks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2009 14:45:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-16"}
