By combining N-body/SPH simulations\nof high redshift galaxy evolution with 3D polychromatic dust radiative transfer\nmodels, we find that luminous DOGs (with F24 > 0.3 mJy at z~2 are well-modeled\nas extreme gas-rich mergers in massive (~5x10^12-10^13 Msun) halos, with\nelevated star formation rates (~500-1000 Msun/yr) and/or significant AGN growth\n(Mdot > 0.5 Msun/yr), whereas less luminous DOGs are more diverse in nature. At\nfinal coalescence, merger-driven DOGs transition from being starburst dominated\nto AGN dominated, evolving from a \"bump\" to a power-law shaped mid-IR (IRAC)\nspectral energy distribution (SED). After the DOG phase, the galaxy settles\nback to exhibiting a \"bump\" SED with bluer colors and lower star formation\nrates. While canonically power-law galaxies are associated with being\nAGN-dominated, we find that the power-law mid-IR SED can owe both to direct AGN\ncontribution, as well as to a heavily dust obscured stellar bump at times that\nthe galaxy is starburst dominated. Thus power-law galaxies can be either\nstarburst or AGN dominated. Less luminous DOGs can be well-represented either\nby mergers, or by massive ($M_{\\rm baryon} ~5x10^11 Msun) secularly evolving\ngas-rich disc galaxies (with SFR > 50 Msun/yr). By utilising similar models as\nthose employed in the SMG formation study of Narayanan et al. (2010), we\ninvestigate the connection between DOGs and SMGs.

The strange valence quark mass is tuned to\nreproduce the mass of the kaon in the physical limit. The tree-level Symanzik\nimproved gauge action is employed. We use lattices of spatial size 2.1 fm and\n2.7 fm at two values of the lattice spacing with $r_0/a=5.22(2)$ and\n$r_0/a=6.61(3)$. We check for both finite volume and cut-off effects on the\nbaryon masses. We performed a detailed study of the chiral extrapolation of the\noctet and decuplet masses using SU(2) $\\chi$PT. The lattice spacings determined\nusing the nucleon mass at the physical point are consistent with the values\nextracted using the pion decay constant. We examine the issue of isospin\nsymmetry breaking for the octet and decuplet baryons and its dependence on the\nlattice spacing. We show that in the continuum limit isospin breaking is\nconsistent with zero, as expected. The baryon masses that we find after taking\nthe continuum limit and extrapolating to the physical limit are in good\nagreement with experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2009 19:59:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-31"}

The hallmark of a topological insulator is the existence\nof metallic spin-textured surface states that are higher dimensional analogues\nof the edge states that characterize a quantum spin Hall insulator.

For stock volumes, solar X-ray flux intensities, and the\nBak-Tang-Wiesenfeld (BTW) sandpile model, $b_x$ is supercritical for small\nvalues of activity and subcritical for the largest ones, indicating a tendency\nto return to a typical value.

For the BTW model the\ndistribution of $\\xi_x$ is Gaussian, for $x$ sufficiently larger than one, and\nits variance grows linearly with $x$.

In\nanother 7 sources (20+/-7%) a dominant AGN contribution to the X-ray emission\nis required, while in 3 more it is unclear whether stellar process or accretion\nare responsible. Stacking of the X-ray undetected SMGs reveals a highly\nsignificant detection. If due to star formation, this corresponds to an average\nX-ray derived SFR of ~150 Msun/yr. We deduce that the AGN fraction in SMGs\nbased on X-ray observations is 20-29 (+/-7) %, which is towards the lower limit\nof previous estimates. Spectral analysis shows that in general the SMGs are not\nheavily obscured in the X-ray but most of the SMGs classfied as AGN show\nabsorption with N_H in excess of 10^22 cm^-2. Of the secure AGN, the bolometric\nluminosity appears to be dominated by the AGN in only 3 cases. In ~85% of the\nSMGs, the X-ray spectrum effectively rules out an AGN contribution that\ndominates the bolometric emission, even if the AGN is Compton thick. The\nevidence therefore suggests that intense star formation accounts for both the\nFIR and X-ray emission in most SMGs. We argue that, rather than having an\nespecially high AGN fraction or duty cycle, SMGs have a high X-ray detection\nrate at very faint fluxes partly because of their high star formation rates\nand, in rarer cases, because the submm emission is from an AGN.(abridged)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2009 20:01:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

After careful evaluation of the X-ray and Non X-ray\nbackground, the 0.4 -- 7 keV X-ray spectrum of the west lobe is described by a\npower-law model.

After a short\npedagogical introduction to static and dynamic properties of many body systems,\nwe develop a theory for agents interactions on random graph.\n  Our approach is based on describing a social network as a graph whose nodes\nrepresent agents and links between two of them stand for a reciprocal\ninteraction. Each agent has to choose among a dichotomic option (i.e. agree or\ndisagree) with respect to a given matter and he is driven by external\ninfluences (as media) and peer to peer interactions. These mimic the imitative\nbehavior of the collectivity and may possibly be zero if the two nodes are\ndisconnected. For this scenario we work out both the dynamics and the\ncorresponding equilibria (statics). Once the 2-body theory is completely\nexplored, we analyze, on the same random graph, a \"diffusive strategic\ndynamics\" with pairwise interactions, where detailed balance constraint is\nrelaxed. The dynamic encodes some relevant processes which are expected to play\na crucial role in the approach to equilibrium in social systems, i.e. diffusion\nof information and strategic choices. We observe numerically that such a\ndynamics reaches a well defined steady state that fulfills a \"shift property\":\nthe critical interaction strength for the phase transition is lower with\nrespect to the one expected from canonical equilibrium.\n  Finally, we show how the stationary states obtained with this dynamics can be\ndescribed by statistical mechanics equilibria of a diluted p-spin model, for a\nsuitable non-integer real p>2.

We recast this as an ordinary\nfunctional integral by changing direct integration over subpaths constrained to\nall have the same two endpoints into an equivalent integration over those\nsubpaths' unconstrained second derivatives. Function expansion with generalized\nLegendre polynomials of time then enables the functional integral to be\nunambiguously evaluated through first order in the elapsed time, yielding the\nSchroedinger equation with a unique quantization of the classical Hamiltonian.\nWidespread disbelief in that uniqueness stemmed from the mistaken notion that\nno subpath can have its two endpoints arbitrarily far separated when its\nnonzero elapsed time is made arbitrarily short. We also obtain the quantum\namplitude for any specified configuration or momentum path, which turns out to\nbe an ordinary functional integral over, respectively, all momentum or all\nconfiguration paths.

However no\nrigorous verification is given to such a very strong universality of the law in\nmulti-horizon spacetimes. Then, based on thermodynamically consistent and\nrigorous discussion, this paper suggests an evidence of breakdown of\nentropy-area law for horizons in Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime, in which\nthe temperatures of the horizons are different. The outline is as follows: We\nconstruct carefully \"two thermal equilibrium systems\" individually for black\nhole event horizon (BEH) and cosmological event horizon (CEH), for which the\nEuclidean action method is applicable. The integration constant (subtraction\nterm) in Euclidean action is determined with referring to Schwarzschild and de\nSitter canonical ensembles. The free energies of the two thermal systems are\nfunctions of three independent state variables, and we find a similarity of our\ntwo thermal systems with the magnetized gas in laboratory, which gives us a\nphysical understanding of the necessity of three independent state variables.\nThen, via the thermodynamic consistency with three independent state variables,\nthe breakdown of entropy-area law for CEH is suggested. The validity of the law\nfor BEH can not be judged, but we clarify the key issue for BEH's entropy.\nFinally we make comments which may suggest the breakdown of entropy-area law\nfor BEH, and also propose two discussions; one of them is on the quantum\nstatistics of underlying quantum gravity, and another is on the SdS black hole\nevaporation from the point of view of non-equilibrium thermodynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2009 01:23:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2013 01:27:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-05"}

The first experimental evidence of\nthe two-dimensional nature of graphene came from the observation of a sequence\nof plateaus in measurements of its transport properties in the presence of an\napplied magnetic field. These are signatures of the so-called integer quantum\nHall effect. However, as a consequence of the relativistic character of the\ncharge carriers, the integer quantum Hall effect observed in graphene is\nqualitatively different from its semiconductor analogue. As a third\ndistinguishing feature of graphene, it has been conjectured that interactions\nand correlations should be important in this material, but surprisingly,\nevidence of collective behaviour in graphene is lacking. In particular, the\nquintessential collective quantum behaviour in two dimensions, the fractional\nquantum Hall effect (FQHE), has so far resisted observation in graphene despite\nintense efforts and theoretical predictions of its existence. Here we report\nthe observation of the FQHE in graphene. Our observations are made possible by\nusing suspended graphene devices probed by two-terminal charge transport\nmeasurements. This allows us to isolate the sample from substrate-induced\nperturbations that usually obscure the effects of interactions in this system\nand to avoid effects of finite geometry. At low carrier density, we find a\nfield-induced transition to an insulator that competes with the FQHE, allowing\nits observation only in the highest quality samples.

The algorithm is designed to be\nimplemented with FPGAs or custom electronics. The key feature is a processing\ntime that scales linearly with the amount of data to be processed. This means\nthat clustering can be performed in pipeline with the readout, without\nsuffering from combinatorial delays due to looping multiple times through all\nthe data. This feature makes this algorithm especially well suited for problems\nwhere the data has high density, e.g. in the case of tracking devices working\nunder high-luminosity condition such as those of LHC or Super-LHC. The\nalgorithm is organized in two steps: the first step (core) clusters the data;\nthe second step analyzes each cluster of data to extract the desired\ninformation. The current algorithm is developed as a clustering device for\nmodern high-energy physics pixel detectors. However, the algorithm has much\nbroader field of applications. In fact, its core does not specifically rely on\nthe kind of data or detector it is working for, while the second step can and\nshould be tailored for a given application. Applications can thus be foreseen\nto other detectors and other scientific fields ranging from HEP calorimeters to\nmedical imaging. An additional advantage of this two steps approach is that the\ntypical clustering related calculations (second step) are separated from the\ncombinatorial complications of clustering. This separation simplifies the\ndesign of the second step and it enables it to perform sophisticated\ncalculations achieving online-quality in online applications. The algorithm is\ngeneral purpose in the sense that only minimal assumptions on the kind of\nclustering to be performed are made.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2009 09:57:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

When the Doppler boosting effect is taken into\naccount, the peak flux of a flare does not depend on the duration of the flare.\nA rough analysis of the time lags and peak flux evolution indicates that BLO\nflares in the mm - cm wavelengths are high-peaking, i.e., are in the adiabatic\nstage. Thus, the results concur with the generalized shock model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2009 12:58:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

There are, however, turbulent\ndynamo mechnisms that may complement the alpha effect or may be an alternative\nto it. Aims: We investigate models of solar-type dynamos where the alpha effect\nis completely replaced by two other turbulent dynamo mechanisms, namely the\nOmega x J effect and the shear-current effect, which both result from an\ninhomogeneity of the mean magnetic field. Methods: We studied axisymmetric\nmean-field dynamo models containing differential rotation, the Omega x J and\nshear-current effects, and a meridional circulation. The model calculations\nwere carried out using the rotation profile of the Sun as obtained from\nhelioseismic measurements and radial profiles of other quantities according to\na standard model of the solar interior. Results: Without meridional flow, no\nsatisfactory agreement of the models with the solar observations can be\nobtained. With a sufficiently strong meridional circulation included, however,\nthe main properties of the large-scale solar magnetic field, namely, its\noscillatory behavior, its latitudinal drift towards the equator within each\nhalf cycle, and its dipolar parity with respect to the equatorial plane, are\ncorrectly reproduced. Conclusions: We have thereby constructed the first\nmean-field models of solar-type dynamos that do not use the alpha effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2009 14:02:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-08"}

The\nrearrangement of these confining structures governs the lifetime of dynamical\nheterogeneity, that is, how long local regions exhibit anomalously fast or slow\nbehavior. The strength of the confinement effect is correlated with the\nfragility and also influences the aging behavior of glassy systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2009 14:14:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Aug 2010 01:39:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-12"}

The method\nemploys two expansions for the Green function which are respectively valid in\nthe `quasilocal' and `distant past' regimes, and which are matched together\nwithin the normal neighborhood.\n  Building on a fundamental insight due to Avramidi, we provide a system of\ntransport equations for determining key fundamental bi-tensors, including the\ntail-term, V(x,x'), appearing in the Hadamard form of the Green function. These\nbitensors are central to a broad range of problems from radiation reaction and\nthe self-force to quantum field theory in curved spacetime and quantum gravity.\nUsing their transport equations, we show how the quasilocal Green function may\nbe computed throughout the normal neighborhood both numerically and as a\ncovariant Taylor series expansion.

The spectrum of\nthe putative pulsar and compact nebula are well-characterized by an absorbed\npower-law model which, for a reasonable $N_{\\rm H}$ value of $14\\times 10^{22}\n\\rm cm^{-2}$, exhibit an index of 1.1 and 2.5 respectively, typical of\nVela-like PWNe. We demonstrate that, given the H$ $I absorption features\nobserved along the line of sight, the SNR and the H$ $II surrounding region are\nprobably connected and lie between 8 kpc and 13 kpc. The resulting age of the\nsystem is between 10 and 30 kyr. For a 10 kpc distance (also consistent with\nthe X-ray absorption) the 2-10 keV X-ray luminosities of the putative pulsar\nand nebula are $L_{\\rm PSR} \\sim 1.3 \\times 10^{33} d_{10 \\rm kpc}^{2} \\rm\nerg.s^{-1}$ and $L_{\\rm PWN} \\sim 3.9 \\times 10^{33} d_{10}^{2} \\rm erg.s^{-1}$\n($d_{10} = d / 10{\\rm kpc}$). Both the flux ratio of $L_{\\rm PWN}/L_{\\rm PSR}\n\\sim 3.4$ and the total luminosity of this system predict a pulsar spin-down\npower around $\\dot{E} \\sim 4 \\times 10^{36} \\rm erg s^{-1}$. We finally\nconsider several reasons for the asymmetries observed in the PWN morphology and\ndiscuss the potential association with the HESS source in term of a\ntime-dependent one-zone leptonic model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2009 15:42:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

Recent simulations and\nobservations are converging on the view that the extreme luminosity of quasars,\nthe brightest of AGNs, is fueled in major mergers of gas-rich galaxies. In such\na picture, quasars, the highest luminosity AGNs, are expected to be located in\nregions with a higher density of galaxies on small scales where mergers are\nmore likely to take place. However, in this picture, the activity observed in\nlow-luminosity AGNs is due to secular processes that are less dependent on the\nlocal galaxy density. To test this hypothesis, we compare the local photometric\ngalaxy density on kiloparsec scales around spectroscopic type I and type II\nquasars to the local density around lower-luminosity spectroscopic type I and\ntype II AGNs. To minimize projection effects and evolution in the photometric\ngalaxy sample we use to characterize AGN environments, we place our random\ncontrol sample at the same redshift as our AGNs and impose a narrow redshift\nwindow around both the AGNs and control targets. Our results support these\nmerger models for bright AGN origins. We find that the brightest sources have\noverdensities that increase on the smallest scales compared to dimmer sources.\nIn addition, we investigate the nature of the quasar and AGN environments\nthemselves and find that the increased overdensity of early-type galaxies in\nthe environments of bright type I sources suggests that they are located in\nricher cluster environments than dim sources. We measure increased environment\noverdensity with increased quasar black hole mass, consistent with the\nwell-known M_{DMH}-M_{BH} relationship, and find evidence for quenching in the\nenvironments of high accretion efficiency type I quasars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2009 14:45:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-15"}
