These properties are claimed to be\nexplained by a helium detonation in a thin surface layer of an accreting white\ndwarf (Perets et al. 2010).

Such a low mass progenitor had lost its\nhydrogen-rich envelope through binary interaction, having very thin oxygen-rich\nand silicon-rich layers above the collapsing core, thus ejecting a very small\namount of radioactive $^{56}$Ni and oxygen.

With this information, one can calculate how the local\ndensity of states away from the impurity is modified by its presence, below and\nabove the Kondo temperature, and then estimate the range of the disturbances in\nthe non-interacting Fermi sea due to the Kondo effect, and how it changes with\nthe Kondo temperature $T_{\\rm K}$. The results obtained agree with results\nobtained through spin-spin correlations, showing that the LDOS captures the\nphenomenology of the Kondo cloud as well.

The physical implication of large blue shift of Ne viii in the quiet\nSun region is investigated in this paper. Methods. We compare the significant\nNe viii blue shifts, which are visible as large blue patches on the\nDoppler-shift map of a middlelatitude quiet-Sun region observed by SUMER, with\nthe coronal magnetic-field structures as reconstructed from a simultaneous\nphotospheric magnetogram by means of a force-free-field extrapolation. Results.\nWe show for the first time that coronal funnels also exist in the quiet Sun.\nThe region studied contains several small funnels that originate from network\nlanes, expand with height and finally merge into a single wide open-field\nregion. However, the large blue shifts of the Ne viii line are not generally\nassociated with funnels. A comparison between the projections of coronal loops\nonto the solar x-y-plane and the Ne viii dopplergram indicates that there are\nsome loops that reveal large Ne viii blue shifts in both legs, and some loops\nwith upflow in one and downflow in the other leg. Conclusions. Our results\nsuggest that strong plasma outflow, which can be traced by large Ne viii blue\nshift, is not necessarily associated with the solar wind originating in coronal\nfunnels but appears to be a signature of mass supply to coronal loops. Under\nthe assumption that the measured Doppler shift of the Ne viii line represents\nthe real outflow velocity of the neon ions being markers of the proton flow, we\nestimate the mass supply rate to coronal loops to be about 10\\^{34} s\\^{-1}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2009 20:45:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-31"}

We systematically investigate the probability\ndensity functions (PDFs) and power spectra of ionizing flux, by varying several\nparameters such as the m.f.p., minimum halo mass capable of hosting stars, and\nhalo duty cycle. In order to be versatile, we make use of analytic,\nsemi-numeric and numeric approaches.

The distributions also show marked asymmetries, with a\nhigh-value tail set by clustering on small scales, and a shorter low-value tail\nwhich is set by the mean free path. The power spectrum of the ionizing\nbackground is much more sensitive to source properties than the PDF and can be\nwell-understood analytically with a framework similar to the halo model\n(usually used to describe dark matter clustering).

The\ncomputational results on some examples from the literature are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2009 03:29:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-18"}

The microwave anomalous emission, proposed to be due to\nspinning PAHs, should help to better define these species. Moreover,\nunderstanding the fluctuations of the anomalous emission over the sky is\ncrucial for CMB studies. We focus on the long wavelength emission of\ninterstellar PAHs in their rovibrational and rotational transitions. The PAH\nemission spectrum from the IR to the microwave range is presented and compared\nto anomalous emission observations. To model their long wavelength emission, we\ntreat PAHs as isolated systems and follow consistently their IR and rotational\nemissions. We consider several interstellar phases and discuss how the\nanomalous emission may constrain their size distribution. Our model of PAH\nemission accounts for the mid-IR spectra of the diffuse interstellar medium and\nof the Orion Bar. For lambda<3mm the PAH IR emission does not scale any more\nwith the radiation field intensity (Go) unlike the mid-IR part of the spectrum.\nThis emission represents less than 10% of the total dust emission at 100 GHz.\nWe find the broadband emissivity of spinning PAHs per carbon atom to be rather\nconstant for Go<100 and nH<100cm-3. Observations of anomalous emission in the\nPerseus molecular cloud are explained by our model of spinning PAH emission\nwith a standard abundance, supporting PAHs as the origin of the anomalous\nemission. The behaviour of the spinning dust emissivity with Go provides a\nclear test that can be tested against observations of anomalous and dust mid-IR\nemissions. Comparison of these emissions will provide constraints on the size\nand/or electric dipole moment of interstellar PAHs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2009 08:23:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2009 19:23:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2009 08:36:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

A new\nclass of high-Tc iron pnictide composite wires, such as LaFeAsO1-xFx,\nSmFeAsO1-xFx and Sr1-xKxFeAs, has been fabricated by the in situ PIT technique\nusing Fe, Ta and Nb tubes.

However the spread around the mean slope is, at fixed Galactocentric\ndistance, larger than estimated uncertainties. Methods: To provide quantitative\nconstraints on these trends we adopted iron abundances for 265 classical\nCepheids (more than 50% of the currently known sample) based either on\nhigh-resolution spectra or on photometric metallicity indices. Homogeneous\ndistances were estimated using near-infrared Period-Luminosity relations. The\nsample covers the four disk quadrants and their Galactocentric distances range\nfrom ~5 to ~17 kpc. Results: A linear regression over the entire sample\nprovides an iron gradient of -0.051+/-0.004 dex/kpc. The above slope agrees\nquite well, within the errors, with previous estimates based either on Cepheids\nor on open clusters covering similar Galactocentric distances. However, once we\nsplit the sample in inner (Rg < 8 kpc) and outer disk Cepheids we found that\nthe slope (-0.130+/-0.015 dex/kpc) in the former region is ~3 times steeper\nthan the slope in the latter one (-0.042+/-0.004 dex/kpc). We found that in the\nouter disk the radial distribution of metal-poor (MP, [Fe/H]<-0.02 dex) and\nmetal-rich (MR) Cepheids across the four disk quadrants does not show a clear\ntrend when moving from the innermost to the external disk regions. We also\nfound that the relative fractions of MP and MR Cepheids in the 1st and in the\n3rd quadrant differ at 8 sigma (MP) and 15 sigma (MR) level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2009 10:50:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Our analysis indicates that the\nfraction of QSOs with elliptical hosts is higher among QSOs with undetected\nfar-infrared (FIR) emission, small infrared excess, and luminous hosts. The\nhosts of FIR-faint QSOs show a tendency to have less pronounced merger-induced\nmorphological anomalies and larger QSO-to-host luminosity ratios on average\nthan the hosts of FIR-bright QSOs, consistent with late-merger evolution from\nFIR-bright to FIR-faint QSOs. The spheroid sizes and total host luminosities of\nthe radio-quiet PG QSOs in our sample are statistically indistinguishable from\nthe ULIRG hosts presented in Paper I, while those of radio-loud PG QSOs are\nsystematically larger and more luminous. ULIRGs and PG QSOs with elliptical\nhosts fall near, but not exactly on, the fundamental plane of inactive\nspheroids.

A modestly flaring disk model with a total mass of 0.025\nM_Sun and an outer radius of 150 AU was able to reproduce the observed SED.

Firstly, we construct some (n+2)-dimensional collapsing\nspace-times, which include generalised Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi-like solutions,\nand we prove that these can be matched to static $\\Lambda$-vacuum exterior\nspace-times. We then investigate the global properties of the matched solutions\nwhich, besides black holes, may include the existence of naked singularities\nand wormholes. Secondly, we consider as interiors classes of 5-dimensional\ncollapsing solutions built on Riemannian Bianchi IX spatial metrics matched to\nradiating exteriors given by the Bizon-Chmaj-Schmidt metric. In some cases, the\ndata at the boundary for the exterior can be chosen to be close to the data for\nthe Schwarzschild solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2009 15:56:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2009 18:08:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-17"}

We do not assume\ngeneral position. Namely, we handle degenerate input, and produce exact\nresults. We provide a tight bound on the exact maximum complexity of Minkowski\nsums of polytopes in 3D in terms of the number of facets of the summand\npolytopes. The algorithms employ variants of a data structure that represents\narrangements embedded on two-dimensional parametric surfaces in 3D, and they\nmake use of many operations applied to arrangements in these representations.\nWe have developed software components that support the arrangement\ndata-structure variants and the operations applied to them. These software\ncomponents are generic, as they can be instantiated with any number type.\nHowever, our algorithms require only (exact) rational arithmetic. These\nsoftware components together with exact rational-arithmetic enable a robust,\nefficient, and elegant implementation of the Minkowski-sum constructions and\nthe related applications. These software components are provided through a\npackage of the Computational Geometry Algorithm Library (CGAL) called\nArrangement_on_surface_2. We also present exact implementations of other\napplications that exploit arrangements of arcs of great circles embedded on the\nsphere. We use them as basic blocks in an exact implementation of an efficient\nalgorithm that partitions an assembly of polyhedra in 3D with two hands using\ninfinite translations. This application distinctly shows the importance of\nexact computation, as imprecise computation might result with dismissal of\nvalid partitioning-motions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2009 15:51:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-07"}
