We use the\nexample of the NMHV superamplitudes to show that the combined action of\nconventional and dual superconformal symmetries is not sufficient to fix all\nthe freedom in the tree-level amplitudes. We argue that the additional\ninformation needed comes from the study of the analytic properties of the\namplitudes. The requirement of absence of spurious singularities, together with\nthe correct multi-particle singular behavior, determines the unique linear\ncombination of superinvariants corresponding to the n-particle NMHV\nsuperamplitude. The same result can be obtained recursively, by relating the n-\nand (n-1)-particle amplitudes in the singular collinear limit. We also\nformulate constraints on the loop corrections to the superamplitudes, following\nfrom the analytic behavior in the above limits. We then show that the\nholomorphic anomaly of the tree amplitudes leads to the breakdown of dual\nPoincare supersymmetry (which is equivalent to ordinary special conformal\nsupersymmetry) of the ratio of the NMHV and MHV superamplitudes at one-loop\nlevel, but this anomaly does not affect dual conformal symmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2009 19:25:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-17"}

What is the influence of this\nmeridional circulation on the underlying radiative zone, and in particular,\ndoes it provide a significant source of mixing between the two regions? In\nPaper I, we began to study this question by assuming a fixed meridional flow\npattern in the convection zone and calculating its penetration depth into the\nradiative zone.

Here we report experimental studies of\nspatially resolved quasiparticle tunnelling spectra of hole- and electron-type\ncuprate superconductors that manifest direct evidences for the presence of\ncompeting orders (COs) in the cuprates. In contrast to conventional type-II\nsuperconductors that exhibit enhanced local density of states (LDOS) peaking at\nzero energy near the centre of field-induced vortices, the vortex-state LDOS of\nYBa_2Cu_3O_{7-\\delta} (Y-123) and La_{0.1}Sr_{0.9}CuO_2 (La-112) remains\nsuppressed inside the vortex core, with pseudogap (PG)-like features at an\nenergy larger (smaller) than the superconducting (SC) gap \\Delta_{SC} in Y-123\n(La-112). Energy histograms of the SC and PG features reveal steady spectral\nshifts from SC to PG with increasing magnetic field H. These findings may be\nexplained by coexisting COs and SC: For hole-type cuprates with PG above T_c,\nthe primary CO gap (V_{CO}) is larger than \\Delta_{SC} and the corresponding\nCOs are charge/pair-density waves with wave-vectors parallel to\n(\\pi,0)/(0,\\pi). For electron-type cuprates without PG above T_c, V_{CO} is\nsmaller than \\Delta_{SC} and the CO wave-vector is along (\\pi,\\pi).

Fourier\ntransformation of the vortex-state LDOS in Y-123 further reveals multiple sets\nof energy-independent wave-vectors due to field-enhanced pair- and spin-density\nwaves.

Many of these operators arise naturally from correspondences on\nthe moduli spaces, such as Nakajima's Heisenberg operators, and Grojnowski's\nvertex operators.\n  In this paper, we build a new vertex operator out of the Chern class of a\nvector bundle on a pair of moduli spaces.

We have\ncharacterized the evolution of luminous X-ray AGN as the fraction of galaxies\nwith M_R < M_R^*(z)+1 that host AGN with rest-frame, hard X-ray [2--10 keV]\nluminosities L_X,H >= 10^43 \\ergs. The AGN fraction increases from f_A =\n0.134^{+0.18}_{-0.087} percent at a median z=0.19 to f_A = 1.00^{+0.29}_{-0.23}\npercent at a median z=0.72. Our best estimate of the evolution is a factor of\neight increase to z=1 and the statistical significance of the increase is\n3.8sigma. This dramatic evolution is qualitatively similar to the evolution of\nthe star-forming galaxy population in clusters known as the Butcher-Oemler\neffect. We discuss the implications of this result for the coevolution of black\nholes and galaxies in clusters, the evolution of AGN feedback, searches for\nclusters with the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, and the possible detection of\nenvironment-dependent downsizing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2009 00:55:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-24"}

The presented protocols are also showed to be secure\nagainst eavesdropping.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2009 14:00:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Jun 2009 14:29:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 6 Sep 2009 01:39:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The ACS imaging in the F814W filter covered 85\nLAEs of the 119 LAEs identified in the full two square degree field, and 47\nLAEs of them are detected in the ACS images. Nearly half of them are spatially\nextended with a size larger than 0.15 arcsec (~0.88 kpc at z=5.7) up to 0.4\narcsec (~2.5 kpc at z=5.7). The others are nearly unresolved compact objects.\nTwo LAEs show double-component structures, indicating interaction or merging of\nbuilding components to form more massive galaxies. By stacking the ACS images\nof all the detected sources, we obtain a Sersic parameter of n~0.7 with a\nhalf-light radius of 0.13 arcsec (0.76 kpc), suggesting that the majority of\nACS detected LAEs have not spheroidal-like but disk-like or irregular light\nprofiles. Comparing ACS F814W magnitudes (I_814) with Subaru/Suprime-Cam\nmagnitudes in the NB816, i', and z' bands, we find that the ACS imaging in the\nF814W band mainly probes UV continuum rather than Lyman alpha line emission. UV\ncontinuum sizes tend to be larger for LAEs with larger Ly\\alpha emission\nregions as traced by the NB816 imaging. The non-detection of 38 LAEs in the ACS\nimages is likely due to the fact that their surface brightness is even too low\nboth in the UV continuum and Lyalpha emission. Estimating I_814 for the LAEs\nwith ACS non-detection from the z' and NB816 magnitudes, we find that 16 of\nthese are probably LAEs with a size larger than 0.15 arcsec in UV continuum.\nAll these results suggest that our LAE sample contains systematically larger\nLAEs in UV continuum size than those previously studied at z~6.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2009 08:18:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-11"}

That is why both phenomena should be taken into account\nside by side, as the gravitational collapse is considered. Since, under the\nabove transition, the hadronic-phase vacuum (filled up with gluon and chiral\n$q\\bar q$-condensates) turns into the \"empty\" (perturbation) subhadronic-phase\none and, thus, the corresponding (very high) pressure falls down rather\nabruptly, the formerly cold (degenerated) nuclear medium starts to implode into\nthe new vacuum. If the mass of a star is sufficiently large, then this\nimplosion produces an enormous heating, which stops only after quark-gluon\nplasma of a temperature about 100 MeV (or even higher) is formed to withstand\nthe gravitational compression (whereas the highest temperatures of supernovae\nbursts are, at least, one order lower). As a consequence, a \"burning wall\" must\nbe, most probably, erected on the way of further collapsing the matter towards\na black hole formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2009 13:10:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-11"}

We select clusters of galaxies from two\ncatalogues based on the SDSS: the ROSAT-SDSS Galaxy Cluster Survey, and the\nMaxBCG Catalogue. Based on a volume limited sample of galaxies drawn from the\nspectroscopic DR5 SDSS, we constructed sub-samples of clusters of galaxies with\nmore than ten members. Scaling relations as well as segregation of galaxy\nproperties as a function of the normalized clustocentric radii are analyzed.\nThe properties of galaxies in clusters are compared with those of field\ngalaxies. Galaxies in X-ray and MaxBCG selected clusters show similar\nsize-luminosity relations. At equal luminosity, late type galaxies in the field\nhave sizes smaller than cluster galaxies of the same morphological type. The\nFaber-Jackson relation for early-type galaxies in clusters is also the same for\nX-ray selected and MaxBCG clusters. We found clear differences between the\ndynamical properties of galaxies in clusters, the brightest cluster galaxies\n($BCG_s$) and field galaxies. Using several criteria to classify galaxies into\nmorphological types, we reproduce the well know morphological segregation. The\ncorrelation is up to $r/r_{200} \\sim 1$. For the whole range of clustocentric\ndistances, X-ray selected clusters present a higher fraction of early type\ngalaxies than MaxBCG clusters.

The picture is\nparticularly complete if the disorder is 'relevant' or 'irrelevant' in the\nHarris criterion sense: the question addressed is whether quenched disorder\nleads to a critical behavior which is different from the one observed in the\npure, i.e. annealed, system. The Harris criterion prediction is based on the\nsign of the specific heat exponent of the pure system, but it yields no\nprediction in the case of vanishing exponent. This case is called 'marginal',\nand the physical literature is divided on what one should observe for marginal\ndisorder, notably there is no agreement on whether a small amount of disorder\nleads or not to a difference between the critical point of the quenched system\nand the one for the pure system. In a previous work (arXiv:0811.0723) we have\nproven that the two critical points differ at marginality of at least\nexp(-c/beta^4), where c>0 and beta^2 is the disorder variance, for beta in\n(0,1) and Gaussian IID disorder. The purpose of this paper is to improve such a\nresult: we establish in particular that the exp(-c/beta^4) lower bound on the\nshift can be replaced by exp(-c(b)/beta^b), c(b)>0 for b>2 (b=2 is the known\nupper bound and it is the result claimed in [Derrida, Hakim, Vannimenus, JSP\n1992]), and we deal with very general distribution of the IID disorder\nvariables.

Such equations arise in astrophysical\norbital problems in extended mass distributions, in the reheating problem for\ninflationary cosmologies, and in periodic Schr{\\\"o}dinger equations. The growth\nrates for solutions to the periodic differential equation can be described by a\nmatrix transformation, where the matrix elements vary from cycle to cycle.\nWorking in the delta function limit, this paper addresses several coupled\nissues: We find the growth rates for the $2 \\times 2$ matrices that describe\nthe solutions.

The effect of nonlinearity and inclusion concentration is investigated\nin the context of power-law (with strain-rate sensitivity m) behavior for the\nmatrix phase under in-plane shear loadings. Overall, the `second-order'\nestimates are found to be in good agreement with the numerical simulations,\nwith the best agreement for the rigidly reinforced materials. For the porous\nsystems, as the nonlinearity increases (m decreases), the strain field is found\nto localize along shear bands passing through the voids (the strain\nfluctuations becoming unbounded) and the effective stress exhibits a singular\nbehavior in the dilute limit. More specifically, for small porosities and fixed\nnonlinearity m>0, the effective stress decreases linearly with increasing\nporosity. However, for ideally plastic behavior (m = 0), the dependence on\nporosity becomes non-analytic. On the other hand, for rigidly-reinforced\ncomposites, the strain field adopts a tile pattern with bounded strain\nfluctuations, and no singular behavior is observed (to leading order) in the\ndilute limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2009 10:58:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-09"}
