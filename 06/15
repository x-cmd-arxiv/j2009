However, for\nnontrivially-embedded surface operators, exact S-duality holds if and only if\nthe \"quantum\" parameter effectively vanishes, while the overall SL(2,Z) duality\nholds up to a c-number at most, regardless. Nevertheless, this observation sets\nthe stage for a physical proof of a remarkable mathematical result by\nKronheimer and Mrowka--that expresses a \"ramified\" analog of the Donaldson\ninvariants solely in terms of the ordinary Donaldson invariants--which, will\nappear, among other things, in forthcoming work. As a prelude to that, the\neffective interaction on the corresponding u-plane will be computed. In\naddition, the dependence on second Stiefel-Whitney classes and the appearance\nof a Spin^c structure in the associated low-energy Seiberg-Witten theory with\nsurface operators, will also be demonstrated. In the process, we will stumble\nupon an interesting phase factor that is otherwise absent in the \"unramified\"\ncase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2009 14:55:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2009 18:44:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2009 17:51:32 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2009 02:36:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-30"}

We introduce ``calorons with a nontrivial holonomy'' that are\ngeneralizations of instantons and can be viewed as ``made of'' constituent\ndyons. The quantum weight with which these calorons contribute to the\nYang--Mills partition function is considered, and the ensuing statistical\nmechanics of the ensemble of interacting dyons is discussed. We argue that a\nsimple semiclassical picture based on dyons satisfies all known criteria of\nconfinement and explains the confinement-deconfinement phase transition.

Despite being centerless, the\nG(2) gauge group possesses confinement at low temperatures, and a 1st order\ndeconfinement transition, according to several latest lattice simulations,\nindicating that confinement-deconfinement is not related to the group center.\nDyons, however, reproduce this behaviour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2009 12:11:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-04"}

The\nlargest flaw remained that no function asked for the buffer size of destination\nbuffers for any function copying data into a user-supplied buffer. According to\nearlier research we performed, we know that error condition handling was the\nfirst solution to security vulnerabilities, followed by precondition\nvalidation. The standard C functions typically perform little precondition\nvalidation and error handling, allowing for a wide range of security issues to\nbe introduced in their use. ISO/IEC TR 24731, titled as \"TR 24731: Safer C\nlibrary functions\", defines 41 new library functions for memory copying, string\nhandling (both for normal and wide character strings), time printing, sorting,\nsearching etc. Another innovation it brings is a constraint handling\narchitecture, forcing error handling when certain security-related\npreconditions are violated when the functions are called. It also specifies the\nnull-termination of all strings manipulated through its function and introduces\na new unsigned integer type that helps preventing integer overflows and\nunderflows.

The X-ray emission comes from the\naccretion of stellar winds from the massive donor stars, and variability of\nluminosity may be due to the changes of its orbit phase.

Most GCs in NGC 5128 follow the general trends of GCs in M31 and\nMilky Way in UV - optical color-color diagram, which indicates that the\nmajority of GCs in NGC 5128 are old similar to the age range of old GCs in M31\nand Milky Way. A large fraction of spectroscopically identified\nintermediate-age GC (IAGC) candidates with ~ 3-8 Gyr are not detected in the\nFUV passband. Considering the nature of intermediate-age populations being\nfaint in the far-UV (FUV) passband, we suggest that many of the\nspectroscopically identified IAGCs may be truly intermediate in age. This is in\ncontrast to the case of M31 where a large fraction of spectroscopically\nsuggested IAGCs are detected in FUV and therefore may not be genuine IAGCs but\nrather older GCs with developed blue horizontal branch stars. Our UV photometry\nstrengthens the results previously suggesting the presence of GC and stellar\nsubpopulation with intermediate age in NGC 5128. The existence of IAGCs\nstrongly indicates the occurrence of at least one more major star formation\nepisode after a starburst at high redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2009 04:26:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-22"}

We demonstrate that for\narmchair host ribbons, depending on the type of corrugation, a band gap or\nlow-velocity minibands appear near the charge neutrality point. For higher\nenergies the allowed Bloch state bands become separated by mini-stopbands.

This work presents the results obtained on HD 50844: the\n140,016 datapoints were analysed using independent approaches and several\nchecks performed. A level of 10^{-5} mag was reached in the amplitude spectra\nof the CoRoT timeseries. The frequency analysis of the CoRoT timeseries\nrevealed hundreds of terms in the frequency range 0--30 d^{-1}.

Specifically, the dressing function\nof the ghost propagator is related to the two form factors in the Lorentz\ndecomposition of a certain Green's function, appearing in a variety of\nfield-theoretic contexts. The central identity, which is valid only in the\nLandau gauge, is derived from the Schwinger-Dyson equations governing the\ndynamics of the aforementioned quantities. The renormalization procedure that\npreserves the validity of the identity is carried out, and various relevant\nkinematic limits and physically motivated approximations are studied in detail.\nA crucial ingredient in this analysis is the infrared finiteness of the gluon\npropagator, which is inextricably connected with the aforementioned freezing of\nthe effective charges.

Although the two approaches are\nsomewhat similar in logic and quite agreeable in outcome, we argue that our\nversion is conceptually more elegant and formally simpler than its precursor.\nMoreover, our rendition is able to circumvent a couple of previously unnoticed\ntechnical issues and, as an added bonus, translates to generic theories of\ngravity in a very direct manner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2009 09:15:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Jul 2009 19:22:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-09"}

More precisely, we characterize the\nimage of the order map defined by Forsberg, Passare, and Tsikh.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2009 15:50:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-05"}

First, we show that a perturbation of\norder O(1/N) is sufficient and, in general, necessary to destroy the\nentanglement of any state admitting an N Bose symmetric extension. On the other\nhand, the minimum amount of local noise necessary to induce separability on\nstates arising from N Bose symmetric extensions with Positive Partial Transpose\n(PPT) decreases at least as fast as O(1/N^2). From these results, we derive\nupper bounds on the time and space complexity of the weak membership problem of\nseparability when attacked via algorithms that search for PPT symmetric\nextensions. Finally, we show how to estimate the error we incur when we\napproximate the set of separable states by the set of (PPT) N -extendable\nquantum states in order to compute the maximum average fidelity in pure state\nestimation problems, the maximal output purity of quantum channels, and the\ngeometric measure of entanglement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2009 15:56:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}
