A more\ngeneral case was considered by Feigin and Loktev by replacing the polynomial\nring with the coordinate ring of an algebraic variety. We show that there is a\nnatural definition of the local and global modules via homological properties.\nThis characterization allows us to define the Weyl functor from the category of\nleft modules of a commutative algebra to the category of modules for a simple\nLie algebra. As an application we are able to understand the relationships of\nthese functors to tensor products, generalizing previous results. Finally an\nanalysis of the fundamental Weyl modules proves that the functors are not left\nexact in general, even for coordinate rings of affine varieties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2009 19:13:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-18"}

For example, it allows the initialization of the both the electron\nspin as well as hyperfine-coupled nuclear spins in a well defined state by\ncombining millimeter and RF radiation; it can increase the T2 relaxation times\nby eliminating decoherence due to dipolar interaction; and it can lead to new\nmechanisms for the coherent electrical readout of electron spins. We will show\nsome examples of these and other effects in Si:P, SiC:N, and nitrogen-related\ncenters in diamond.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2009 18:12:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-24"}

The HI catalog\npresented here for this 118-deg^2 region is combined with ones derived from\nsurrounding regions also covered by the ALFALFA survey to examine the large\nscale structure in the complex Leo region. Because of the combination of wide\nsky coverage and superior sensitivity, spatial and spectral resolution, the\nALFALFA HI catalog of the Leo region improves significantly on the numbers of\nlow HI mass sources as compared with those found in previous HI surveys. The HI\nmass function of the Leo I group presented here is dominated by low-mass\nobjects: 45 of the 65 Leo I members have M_HI < 10^8 Msun, yielding tight\nconstraints on the low-mass slope of the Leo I HI mass function.

We\nderive the temporal evolution of the effective temperature, radius, expansion\nspeeds, and bolometric luminosity, as well as the progenitor wind density and\ntotal swept-up mass overtaken by the shock. SN2006gy can be interpreted in the\ncontext of shock interaction with a dense CSM, but with quite extreme values\nfor the CSM mass of 20 Msun and an explosion kinetic energy of at least 5e51\nerg. A key difference between SN2006gy and other SNeIIn is that, owing to its\nlarge CSM mass, the interaction region remained opaque much longer. At early\ntimes, H-alpha widths suggest that the photosphere is ahead of the shock, and\nphotons diffuse out through the opaque CSM. The pivotal transition to optically\nthin emission begins around day 110, when we start to see a decrease in the\nblackbody radius and strengthening tracers of the post-shock shell. From the\nevolution of pre-shock velocities, we deduce that the CSM was ejected by the\nprogenitor in a 1e49 erg precursor event 8yr before explosion. The large CSM\nmass rules out models involving stars with initial masses around 10Msun. With\nthe full mass budget, even massive M_ZAMS=30-40 Msun progenitor stars are\ninadequate. At roughly solar metallicity, substantial mass loss probably\noccurred during the star's life, so SN 2006gy's progenitor is more consistent\nwith LBV eruptions or pulsational pair-instability ejections in stars with\ninitial masses above 100 Msun.

The total energy budget\n(> 2 x 10^51 erg radiated in the optical alone) poses many challenges for\nstandard SN theory. We present new ground-based near-infrared (NIR)\nobservations of SN 2006gy, as well as a single epoch of Hubble Space Telescope\n(HST) imaging obtained more than two years after the explosion. Our NIR data\ntaken around peak optical emission show an evolution that is largely consistent\nwith a cooling blackbody, with tentative evidence for a growing NIR excess\nstarting at day ~100. Our late-time Keck adaptive optics (AO) NIR image, taken\non day 723, shows little change from previous NIR observations taken around day\n400. Furthermore, the optical HST observations show a reduced decline rate\nafter day 400, and the SN is bluer on day 810 than it was at peak. This\nlate-time decline is inconsistent with Co56 decay, and thus is problematic for\nthe various pair-instability SN models used to explain the nature of SN 2006gy.\nThe slow decline of the NIR emission can be explained with a light echo, and we\nconfirm that the late-time NIR excess is the result of a massive (>10 Msun)\ndusty shell heated by the SN peak luminosity. The late-time optical\nobservations require the existence of a scattered light echo, which may be\ngenerated by the same dust that contributes to the NIR echo. Both the NIR and\noptical echoes originate in the proximity of the progenitor, ~10^18 cm for the\nNIR echo and <~10-40 pc for the optical echo, which provides further evidence\nthat the progenitor of SN 2006gy was a very massive star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2009 11:27:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2011 19:41:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

Some\nattractive properties are derived for the residuals, whose norms are\n$\\xi_{k+1}$'s, of the linear systems obtained by the Lanczos method. Based on\nthem and the new general convergence results, we make a refined analysis and\nestablish new local convergence results. It is proved that the inexact RQI with\nLanczos converges quadratically provided that $\\xi_{k+1}\\leq\\xi$ with a\nconstant $\\xi\\geq 1$. The method is guaranteed to converge linearly provided\nthat $\\xi_{k+1}$ is bounded by a small multiple of the reciprocal of the\nresidual norm $\\|r_k\\|$ of the current approximate eigenpair. The results are\nfundamentally different from the existing convergence results that always\nrequire $\\xi_{k+1}<1$, and they have a strong impact on effective\nimplementations of the method. We extend the new theory to the inexact RQI with\na tuned preconditioned Lanczos for the linear systems. Based on the new theory,\nwe can design practical criteria to control $\\xi_{k+1}$ to achieve quadratic\nconvergence and implement the method more effectively than ever before.\nNumerical experiments confirm our theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2009 01:28:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2010 00:34:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2010 14:00:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2011 02:07:40 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2015 13:21:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

The radial intensity dependence of these features is determined by the\nform of the wavefunctions of the electrons in the quantum Hall regime.\nMoreover, some of these regions break rotational symmetry, and their angular\ndependence is determined by the chirality of the graphene electrons. For the\nzeroth Landau level, the ratio between the features at the corners and center\nof the BZ depends on the nature of the disorder: it goes to zero for potential\ndisorder, and is finite for hopping disorder.

The type of the SN\nprogenitor was determined from the surface abundances at the pre-SN stage. The\ntype of the SN event was obtained from the masses of hydrogen and helium\nejected at the time of the core-collapse SN event. We find that the minimum\namount of helium ejected by a core-collapse SN (of whatever type) is around 0.3\nMSun. There is no difference between the WC and WO stars in the ejected masses\nof helium, CNO elements, and heavy elements. Also no difference is expected\nbetween the chemical composition of a WC star resulting from a normal or a\nhomogeneous evolution. The progenitors of type Ib SNe are WNL, WNE, or less\nmassive WC stars. Those of type Ic are WC and WO stars. WO stars are produced\nin a limited mass range (around 60 MSun) and only at low metallicity (for <=\n0.010) as already found. The WO stars are the progenitors of only a small\nfraction of type Ic. Present stellar models indicate that, at solar\nmetallicity, there is about 1 type Ib SN for 1 type Ic, and this ratio rises to\n3 type Ic for 1 type Ib SN at twice solar metallicity. At this metallicity,\ntype Ic's are more frequent than type Ib's because most massive stars that go\nthrough a WNE stage evolve further into a WC/WO phase. Current models can\naccount for the observed number ratios SN Ib/SN II and SN Ic/SN II and for\ntheir observed variation with the metallicity. In case no supernova occurs when\na black hole is formed, single-star models can still account for more than half\nof the observed (SN Ib+SN Ic)/SN II ratio for Z >= ZSun. For the GRB rate, our\nmodels produce too large a number for such an event, even if we restrict the\nprogenitor to the WO stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2009 09:52:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-17"}

Servers are dynamically\nchosen to serve customers, and buffers are available for customers waiting to\nbe served. The arrival rates and the number of servers are scaled up in such a\nway that the processes representing the number of class-$i$ customers in the\nsystem, $i\\in\\mathcal{I}$, fluctuate about a static fluid model, that is\nassumed to be critically loaded in a standard sense.

It allows for a systematic expansion taking into account both\nlocal as well as pion-mediated multi-nucleon interactions. We apply this power\ncounting in the present study to the evaluation of the pion self-energy and the\nenergy density in nuclear and neutron matter at next-to-leading order. To\nimplement this power counting in actual calculations we develop here a\nnon-perturbative method based on Unitary Chiral Perturbation Theory for\nperforming the required resummations. We show explicitly that the contributions\nto the pion self-energy with in-medium nucleon-nucleon interactions to this\norder cancel. The main trends for the energy density of symmetric nuclear and\nneutron matter are already reproduced at next-to-leading order. In addition, an\naccurate description of the neutron matter equation of state, as compared with\nsophisticated many-body calculations, is obtained by varying only slightly a\nsubtraction constant around its expected value. The case of symmetric nuclear\nmatter requires the introduction of an additional fine-tuned subtraction\nconstant, parameterizing the effects from higher order contributions. With\nthat, the empirical saturation point and the nuclear matter incompressiblity\nare well reproduced while the energy per nucleon as a function of density\nclosely agrees with sophisticated calculations in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2009 14:37:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2009 15:48:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2010 14:31:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-01"}

We indeed exhibit the relations\ndescribing the possible changes in the parameters of the digital straight\nsegment under investigation.

As a result\nwe have a better understanding of their evolution during recognition and\nanalytical formulas to compute them. We also show how this evolution can be\nprojected onto the Stern-Brocot tree. These new relations have interesting\nconsequences on the geometry of digital curves.

These are\nimportant for establishing whether and by which channels the sd stars arise\nfrom interactions in close binary systems. It has been suggested that the list\nof PG sd stars is biased by the exclusion of many stars in binaries, whose\nspectra show the Ca II K line in absorption. A total of 1125 objects that were\nphotometrically selected as candidates were ultimately rejected from the final\nPG catalog using this K-line criterion. We study 88 of these \"PG-Rejects\"\n(PGRs), to assess whether there are significant numbers of unrecognized sd\nstars in binaries among the PGR objects. The presence of a sd should cause a\nlarge UVX. We assemble GALEX, Johnson V, and 2MASS photometry and compare the\ncolors of these PGR objects with those of known sd stars, cool single stars,\nand hot+cool binaries. Sixteen PGRs were detected in both the far- and near-\nultraviolet GALEX passbands. Eleven of these, plus the 72 cases with only an\nupper limit in the far-ultraviolet band, are interpreted as single cool stars.\nOf the remaining five stars, three are consistent with being sd stars paired\nwith a cool main sequence companion, while two may be single stars or composite\nsystems of another type. We discuss the implications of these findings for the\n1125 PGR objects as a whole.

Some of the\ncrucial results we obtain are of relevance to other muti-terminal geometries.\nWe show that the voltage of the injector does not cut the flow of relevant\nscattering processes in the wire. Either a grounded or a semi-infinite wire at\ntoo low temperature is driven into the strong coupling regime.\n  We show that the injector induce invasive effects. They are due to non-local\nbackscattering processes generated both by virtual higher order tunneling\nprocesses and by Coulomb interactions with the injector. The latter induce in\naddition screening of interactions in the wire. For an STM, those effects can\ndrastically mask the probed density of states (DOS). In the limit of zero\ntemperature, a long and grounded wire is driven to its fixed point where it is\ndisconnected at the tunneling point. Thus instead of the bulk expected DOS, the\nSTM probes the end one. We analyze current auto- and cross-correlations. We\nshow that the cross-correlations are dominated by their value in the\ntwo-terminal geometry. As these are opposite to the current auto-correlations,\nthey are always negative for local scattering processes.
