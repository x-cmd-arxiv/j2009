Our aim is\nto resolve this controversy by an independent investigation of the reaction\nscheme for a range of H-atom fluxes and different ice temperatures and\nthicknesses. Reaction rates are determined by using a state-of-the-art ultra\nhigh vacuum experimental setup to bombard an interstellar CO ice analog with\nroom temperature H atoms. The reaction of CO + H into H2CO and subsequently\nCH3OH is monitored by a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer in a reflection\nabsorption mode. In addition, after each completed measurement a temperature\nprogrammed desorption experiment is performed to identify the produced species.\nDifferent H-atom fluxes, morphologies, and ice thicknesses are tested. The\nformation of both formaldehyde and methanol via CO hydrogenation is confirmed\nat low temperature (12-20 K). We confirm, as proposed by Hidaka et al., that\nthe discrepancy between the two Japanese studies is mainly due to a difference\nin the applied hydrogen atom flux. The production rate of formaldehyde is found\nto decrease and the penetration column to increase with temperature. In order\nto fully understand the laboratory data, the experimental results are\ninterpreted using Monte Carlo simulations. This technique takes into account\nthe layered structure of CO ice. Temperature-dependent reaction barriers and\ndiffusion rates are inferred using this model.

Two steady oblique spatial dispersive shock waves (DSWs)\nspreading from the pointed ends of the body are generated in both half-planes.\nThese are described analytically by constructing appropriate exact solutions of\nthe Whitham modulation equations for the front DSW and by using a generalized\nBohr-Sommerfeld quantization rule for the oblique dark soliton fan in the rear\nDSW. We propose an extension of the traditional modulation description of DSWs\nto include the linear \"ship wave\" pattern forming outside the nonlinear\nmodulation region of the front DSW. Our analytic results are supported by\ndirect 2D unsteady numerical simulations and are relevant to recent experiments\non Bose-Einstein condensates freely expanding past obstacles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2009 19:58:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 13 Jun 2009 13:40:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

Most of these cool-core\ngroups show a central Fe and Si excess, which can be explained by prolonged\nenrichment by SN Ia and stellar winds in the central early-type galaxy alone,\nbut with tentative evidence for additional processes contributing to core\nenrichment in hotter groups. Inferred metal mass-to-light ratios inside r_500\nshow a positive correlation with total group mass but are generally\nsignificantly lower than in clusters, due to a combination of lower global ICM\nabundances and gas-to-light ratios in groups.

Here we study dynamo action realized in the bulk of\nthe convection zone for two systems, rotating at three and five times the\ncurrent solar rate. We find that substantial organized global-scale magnetic\nfields are achieved by dynamo action in these systems. Striking wreathes of\nmagnetism are built in the midst of the convection zone, coexisting with the\nturbulent convection. This is a great surprise, for many solar dynamo theories\nhave suggested that a tachocline of penetration and shear at the base of the\nconvection zone is a crucial ingredient for organized dynamo action, whereas\nthese simulations do not include such tachoclines. Some dynamos achieved in\nthese rapidly rotating states build persistent global-scale fields which\nmaintain amplitude and polarity for thousands of days. In the case at five\ntimes the solar rate, the dynamo can undergo cycles of activity, with fields\nvarying in strength and even changing polarity.

Many of the physical properties of\nthe Cosmic Horseshoe are similar to those of the only other galaxy at z = 2-3\nstudied in comparable detail up to now: MS 1512-cB58. The fact that these two\ngalaxies have drastically different Lya lines may be due simply to orientation\neffects, or differences in the covering factor of outflowing gas, and cautions\nagainst classifying high-z galaxies only on the basis of spectral features,\nsuch as Lya, whose appearance can be affected by a variety of different\nparameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2009 20:00:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The conventional approaches use\nthe upper kinematical endpoints of the individual distributions m_{jll},\nm_{jl(lo)} and m_{jl(hi)}, all three of which suffer from parameter space\nregion ambiguities and may lead to multiple solutions for the SUSY mass\nspectrum. In contrast, we do not use m_{jll}, m_{jl(lo)} and m_{jl(hi)}, and\ninstead propose a new set of (infinitely many) variables whose upper kinematic\nendpoints exhibit reduced sensitivity to the parameter space region. We then\noutline an alternative, much simplified procedure for obtaining the SUSY mass\nspectrum. In particular, we show that the four endpoints observed in the three\ndistributions m^2_{ll}, m^2_{jln} U m^2_{jlf} and m^2_{jln}+m^2_{jlf} are\nsufficient to completely pin down the squark mass and the two neutralino\nmasses, leaving only a discrete 2-fold ambiguity for the slepton mass. This\nremaining ambiguity can be easily resolved in a number of different ways: for\nexample, by a single additional measurement of the kinematic endpoint of any\none out of the many remaining 1-dimensional distributions at our disposal, or\nby exploring the correlations in the 2-dimensional distribution of m^2_{jln} U\nm^2_{jlf} versus m^2_{ll}.

This extensive rotational period study in\nthe 1 Myr old Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) is based on a deep photometric\nmonitoring campaign using the Wide Field Imager (WFI) camera on the ESO/MPG\n2.2m telescope on La Silla, Chile.

The LLNS equations\nincorporate thermal fluctuations into macroscopic hydrodynamics by the addition\nof white-noise fluxes whose magnitudes are set by a fluctuation-dissipation\nrelation. Originally derived for equilibrium fluctuations, the LLNS equations\nhave also been shown to be accurate for non-equilibrium systems. Previous\nstudies of numerical methods for the LLNS equations focused primarily on\nmeasuring variances and correlations computed at equilibrium and for selected\nnon-equilibrium flows. In this paper, we introduce a more systematic approach\nbased on studying discrete equilibrium structure factors for a broad class of\nexplicit linear finite-volume schemes. This new approach provides a better\ncharacterization of the accuracy of a spatio-temporal discretization as a\nfunction of wavenumber and frequency, allowing us to distinguish between\nbehavior at long wavelengths, where accuracy is a prime concern, and short\nwavelengths, where stability concerns are of greater importance. We use this\nanalysis to develop a specialized third-order Runge Kutta scheme that minimizes\nthe temporal integration error in the discrete structure factor at long\nwavelengths for the one-dimensional linearized LLNS equations. Together with a\nnovel method for discretizing the stochastic stress tensor in dimension larger\nthan one, our improved temporal integrator yields a scheme for the\nthree-dimensional equations that satisfies a discrete fluctuation-dissipation\nbalance for small time steps and is also sufficiently accurate even for time\nsteps close to the stability limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2009 20:47:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2009 21:50:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-18"}

This code,\ndesigned for the all-sky detection of gravitational wave bursts with minimal\nassumptions on the shape of the waveform, filters the data with a bank of\nsine-Gaussians, or sinusoids with Gaussian envelope. The algorithm's\nperformance was compared to matched filtering with ring-down templates. The\nresults are qualitatively consistent; however due to the low simulation\nstatistics in the first NINJA project, it is premature to draw quantitative\nconclusions at this stage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2009 23:27:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 24 Oct 2010 19:00:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-27"}

Efficient sampling\nalgorithms to sample according to a probability density (to which the other two\nproblems can be reduced) relies on good isoperimetry which is known to hold for\narbitrary logconcave densities. In this paper, we extend this frontier in two\nways: first, we characterize convexity-like conditions that imply good\nisoperimetry, i.e., what condition on function values along every line\nguarantees good isoperimetry? The answer turns out to be the set of\n(1/(n-1))-harmonic concave functions in R^n; we also prove that this is the\nbest possible characterization along every line, of functions having good\nisoperimetry. Next, we give the first efficient algorithm for sampling\naccording to such functions with complexity depending on a smoothness\nparameter. Further, noting that the multivariate Cauchy density is an important\ndistribution in this class, we exploit certain properties of the Cauchy density\nto give an efficient sampling algorithm based on random walks with a mixing\ntime that matches the current best bounds known for sampling logconcave\nfunctions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Jun 2009 05:15:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-16"}

With this simple model, we are then able to recover the observed\n$\\gamma$ value provided $\\alpha$ is suitably set. It turns out that an\nanisotropy profile which is tangential inside $\\sim 0.6 r_a$ and radial\noutside, with $r_a$ the anisotropy radius, is able to reproduce the observed\nsize - mass relation observed for massive ($M_{\\star} \\ge 2 \\times 10^{10} \\\nh^{-1} {\\rm M}_{\\odot}$) elliptical galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Jun 2009 08:53:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-04"}

Especially in\nvery large time series databases, sequential scan through the entire database\nis definitely impractical, even with random access that exploits some index\nstructures since high dimensionality of time series data incurs extremely high\nI/O cost. More specifically, a sequential structure consumes high CPU but low\nI/O costs, while an index structure requires low CPU but high I/O costs. In\nthis work, we therefore propose a novel indexed sequential structure called\nTWIST (Time Warping in Indexed Sequential sTructure) which benefits from both\nsequential access and index structure. When a query sequence is issued, TWIST\ncalculates lower bounding distances between a group of candidate sequences and\nthe query sequence, and then identifies the data access order in advance, hence\nreducing a great number of both sequential and random accesses. Impressively,\nour indexed sequential structure achieves significant speedup in a querying\nprocess by a few orders of magnitude. In addition, our method shows superiority\nover existing rival methods in terms of query processing time, number of page\naccesses, and storage requirement with no false dismissal guaranteed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Jun 2009 09:07:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-16"}

A\nfundamental question is whether an \\alpha-approximation algorithm translates\ninto an \\alpha-approximate truthful mechanism. It is well-known that plugging\nan \\alpha-approximation algorithm into the VCG technique may not yield a\ntruthful mechanism. Thus, it is natural to investigate properties of\napproximation algorithms that enable their use in truthful mechanisms.\n  The main contribution of this paper is to identify a useful and natural\nproperty of approximation algorithms, which we call loser-independence; this\nproperty is applicable in the single-minded and single-parameter settings.\nIntuitively, a loser-independent algorithm does not change its outcome when the\nbid of a losing agent increases, unless that agent becomes a winner. We\ndemonstrate that loser-independent algorithms can be employed as sub-procedures\nin a greedy iterative packing approach while preserving monotonicity. A greedy\niterative approach provides a good approximation in the context of maximizing a\nnon-decreasing submodular function subject to independence constraints. Our\nframework gives rise to truthful approximation mechanisms for various problems.\nNotably, some problems arise in online mechanism design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Jun 2009 10:39:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Second,\nthe Brier Score and the Integrated Discrimination Improvement (IDI) are more\nuseful than the concordance statistic for quantifying precision gains obtained\nfrom model expansion. Finally, these precision gains are apt to be small,\nalthough they may be large for some individuals. We propose a new way to\nidentify these individuals, and show how to quantify how much they gain by\nmeasuring the additional covariates. Those with largest gains could be targeted\nfor cost-efficient covariate assessment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2009 21:29:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-16"}

We strongly believe that designing energy-efficient network\nequipment can be compared to building sports cars, task-oriented, focused and\nfast. However, unlike track-bound sports cars, ultra-fast and purpose-built\nsilicon yields better energy efficiency when compared to more generic family\nsedan designs that mitigate go-to-market risks by being the masters of many\ntasks. Thus, we demonstrate that the best opportunities for power savings come\nvia protocol simplification, best-of-breed technology, and silicon and software\noptimization, to achieve the least amount of processing necessary to move\npackets. We also look to the future of networking from a new angle, where\nenergy efficiency and environmental concerns are viewed as fundamental design\ncriteria and forces that need to be harnessed to continually create more\npowerful networking equipment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Jun 2009 10:49:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}
