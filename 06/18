This class of models\nincludes ABJM theory, the proposed gauge theory dual of M-theory on AdS_4 x\nS^7/Z_k, as a special case. In the UV limit of the N=3 theories the Yang-Mills\ncoupling becomes weak and the monopole operators are described by classical\nbackgrounds. This allows us to find their SU(2)_R charges in a one-loop\ncomputation which by virtue of the non-renormalization of non-abelian R-charges\nyields the exact result for any value of the coupling. The spectrum of SU(2)_R\ncharges is found by quantizing the SU(2)/U(1) collective coordinate of the BPS\nbackground, whose dynamics is that of a charged particle on a sphere with a\nWess-Zumino term representing a magnetic monopole at its center. If the\nWess-Zumino coefficient is h, then the smallest possible SU(2)_R representation\nfor BPS monopole operators has spin |h|/2. We find, in agreement with earlier\nproposals, that h is proportional to the sum of the U(1)_R charges of all the\nfermion fields weighted by the effective monopole charges determined by their\ngauge representations. The field content of ABJM theory is such that h=0. This\nproves for any Chern-Simons level k the existence of monopole operators which\nare singlets under all global symmetries and have vanishing scaling dimensions.\nThese operators are essential for matching the spectrum of the ABJM theory with\nsupergravity and for the supersymmetry enhancement to N=8.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2009 17:19:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 2009 19:26:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

We uncover the additional scalar\ndegree of freedom arising from the explicit breaking of the general covariance\nand study its properties. The analysis is performed both in the original\nformulation of the theory and in the Stueckelberg picture. A peculiarity of the\nnew mode is that it satisfies an equation of motion that is of first order in\ntime derivatives. At linear level the mode is manifest only around spatially\ninhomogeneous and time-dependent backgrounds. We find two serious problems\nassociated with this mode. First, the mode develops very fast exponential\ninstabilities at short distances. Second, it becomes strongly coupled at an\nextremely low cutoff scale. We also discuss the \"projectable\" version of\nHorava's proposal and argue that this version can be understood as a certain\nlimit of the ghost condensate model. The theory is still problematic since the\nadditional field generically forms caustics and, again, has a very low strong\ncoupling scale.

We show that spectra measured under different plasma conditions have a\nsimilar shape. Such a quasi-universal spectrum consists of three parts: two\npower laws and an exponential domain. At MHD scales, Kolmogorov's law $\\sim\nk^{-5/3}$ is found. At scales smaller than the ion characteristic scales, a\n$k^{-2.8}$ law is observed. At scales $k\\rho_e\\sim (0.1-1)$, where $\\rho_e$ is\nthe electron gyroradius, the magnetic spectrum follows an exponential law\n$\\exp(-k^{1/2})$, indicating the onset of dissipation. This is the first\nobservation of an exponential magnetic spectrum in space plasmas. We show that\namong several spatial kinetic plasma scales, the electron Larmor radius plays\nthe role of a dissipation scale in space plasma turbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2009 16:25:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2009 15:57:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Although of difficult quantification, cortical synaptic weights\nhave been found to obey a long-tailed unimodal distribution peaking near the\nlowest values, thus confirming some of the predictive models built previously.\nThese models are all causally local, in the sense that they refer to the\nsituation in which a number of neurons all fire directly at the same\npostsynaptic neuron. Consequently, they necessarily embody assumptions\nregarding the generation of action potentials by the presynaptic neurons that\nhave little biological interpretability. In this letter we introduce a network\nmodel of large groups of interconnected neurons and demonstrate, making none of\nthe assumptions that characterize the causally local models, that its long-term\nbehavior gives rise to a distribution of synaptic weights with the same\nproperties that were experimentally observed. In our model the action\npotentials that create a neuron's input are, ultimately, the product of\nnetwork-wide causal chains relating what happens at a neuron to the firings of\nothers. Our model is then of a causally global nature and predicates the\nemergence of the synaptic-weight distribution on network structure and\nfunction. As such, it has the potential to become instrumental also in the\nstudy of other emergent cortical phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2009 17:11:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-19"}

Chiral dynamics generates a distinct\ncomponent of the partonic structure, located at momentum fractions x ~<\nM_pi/M_N and transverse distances b ~ 1/M_pi. We calculate this component using\nphenomenological pion exchange with a physical lower limit in b (the transverse\n\"core\" radius estimated from the nucleon's axial form factor, R_core = 0.55 fm)\nand demonstrate its universal character. This formulation preserves the basic\npicture of the \"pion cloud\" model of the nucleon's sea quark distributions,\nwhile restricting its application to the region actually governed by chiral\ndynamics. It is found that (a) the large-distance component accounts for only\n~1/3 of the measured antiquark flavor asymmetry dbar - ubar at x ~ 0.1; (b) the\nstrange sea quarks, s and sbar, are significantly more localized than the light\nantiquark sea; (c) the nucleon's singlet quark size for x < 0.1 is larger than\nits gluonic size, <b^2>_{q + qbar} > <b^2>_g, as suggested by the t-slopes of\ndeeply-virtual Compton scattering and exclusive J/psi production measured at\nHERA and FNAL.

The scalar fields on the interior brane interact with the\nspin-one fields on the exterior one only through gravitation, they induce the\neffect of Scalar Field Dark Matter with an ultra-light mass on the exterior\none. We discuss two different regimes where the energy density and the brane\ntension are compared, with the aim to obtain the observed dynamics of the\nuniverse after the collision of the branes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2009 19:03:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 2009 16:59:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 30 May 2010 13:26:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-07"}

We construct simple parametric models of the star formation\nhistory that bracket a range of scenarios, and fit these models to the\nlinestrength indices of low-redshift cluster red-sequence galaxies. For giant\ngalaxies, we confirm the downsizing trend. We find, however, that this trend\nflattens or reverses at sigma < 70 km/s. We then compare predicted stellar\nmass-to-light ratios with dynamical mass-to-light ratios derived from the\nFundamental Plane (FP), or by the SAURON group. For galaxies with sigma ~ 70\nkm/s, models with a \"frosting\" of young stars and models with exponential star\nformation histories have stellar mass-to-light ratios that are larger than\nobserved dynamical mass-to-light ratios by factors of 1.7 and 1.4,\nrespectively, and so are rejected. The SSP model is consistent with the FP, and\nrequires a modest amount of dark matter (20-30%) to account for the difference\nbetween stellar and dynamical mass-to-light ratios. A model in which star\nformation was \"quenched\" at intermediate ages is also consistent with the\nobservations. We find that the contribution of stellar populations to the\n\"tilt\" of the FP is highly dependent on the assumed star-formation history: for\nthe SSP model, the tilt of the FP is driven primarily by stellar-population\neffects. For a quenched model, two-thirds of the tilt is due to stellar\npopulations and only one third is due to dark matter or non-homology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2009 20:14:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-28"}

We have analyzed\nhigh-resolution, high signal-to-noise Keck/HIRES spectra of 24 stars with\n[Fe/H] from -2.3 to -3.5 in order to determine the history of Be abundances and\nexplore the possibility of a Be plateau. We have determined stellar parameters\nspectroscopically. Oxygen abundances have been derived from three OH features\nwhich occur in the same spectral region. We have supplemented this sample with\nreanalyzed spectra of 25 stars from previous observations; our total sample\nranges in [Fe/H] from -0.5 to -3.5. We find that the relationship between Be\nand [Fe/H] continues to lower metallicities with a slope of 0.92 +-0.04.\nAlthough there is no indication of a plateau with constant Be abundance, the\nfour lowest metallicity stars do show a Be enhancement relative to Fe. A single\nrelationship between Be and [O/H] has a slope of 1.21 +-0.08, but there is also\na good fit with two slopes: 1.59 for [O/H] > -1.6 and 0.74 for stars with [O/H]\n< -1.6.

Computing the gravity mediated soft terms on the\nStandard Model brane induced by bulk supersymmetry breaking in the LARGE volume\nscenario, we explicitly find suppressions by M_s/M_P ~ V^{-1/2} compared to\nM_{3/2}. This gives rise to several phenomenological scenarios, depending on\nthe strength of perturbative corrections to the effective action and the source\nof de Sitter lifting, in which the soft terms are suppressed by at least\nM_P/V^{3/2} and may be as small as M_P/V^2. Since the gravitino mass is of\norder M_{3/2} ~ M_P/V, for TeV soft terms all these scenarios give a very heavy\ngravitino (M_{3/2} >= 10^8 GeV) and generically the lightest moduli field is\nalso heavy enough (m >= 10 TeV) to avoid the cosmological moduli problem.

As a\nresult, from the initial advective disc models with alpha =0.001 and 0.1, we\nobtain the total luminosities 2.5x10^{40} and 2.0x10^{40} erg/s.

Five of these show blue integrated\nUV-optical colours that set them aside in the NUV integrated colour-magnitude\nrelation.

MONDian clusters need\ndark matter, and here we test the 11 eV sterile neutrino - used to fit the\nfirst three acoustic peaks of the cosmic microwave background - by\ninvestigating their equilibrium distributions in 30 groups and clusters over a\nwide range of temperatures. Knowing both the sterile neutrino density and\nvelocity dispersion tells us the Tremaine-Gunn phase-space limit at all radii.\nWe find that all 30 systems serendipitously reach the Tremaine-Gunn limit by\nthe centre, which means a portion of the dynamical mass must always be covered\nby the brightest cluster galaxy. Interestingly, the typical fitted K-band\nmass-to-light ratio is unity and at most 1.2, which is very consistent -\nalthough leaving no margin for error - with stellar population synthesis\nmodels.

In each case, the\nspatial assignment of material randomness is a non-fractal, strict-white-noise\nfield on a 256 x 256 square lattice of homogeneous, square-shaped grains; the\nflow rule in each grain follows associated plasticity. These lattices are\nsubjected to simple shear loading increasing through either one of three\nmacroscopically uniform boundary conditions (kinematic, mixed-orthogonal or\ntraction), admitted by the Hill-Mandel condition.

While the grains possess sharp elastic-plastic stress-strain\ncurves, the overall stress-strain responses are smooth and asymptote toward\nperfectly-plastic flows; these responses and the fractal dimension-strain\ncurves are almost identical for three different loadings.

Well correlated to dust emission at 100\n$\\mu$m, the anomalous emission is interstellar but its origin is still debated.\nSome possible explanations relate it to dust: emission of spinning, small\n(nanometric) grains carrying a permanent electric dipole or magnetic\nfluctuations in larger (submicronic) grains. To probe the origin of the\nanomalous emission, we compare microwave data to dust IR emission and search\nfor specific signatures predicted by models of spinning dust. For the anomalous\nemission, we use the 23 GHz all-sky map deduced from WMAP data by\nMiville-Deschenes et al. (2008). The dust emission is traced by IRAS data.\nModels show that spinning dust emission is little sensitive to the intensity of\nthe radiation field (Go) for 10<nu<30 GHz while the corresponding mid-IR\nemission is proportional to Go. To test this behaviour in our comparison, we\nderive Go from the dust temperature maps of Schlegel et al. (1998). From\nall-sky maps, we show that the anomalous emission is better correlated to the\nemission of small grains (at 12 $\\mu$m) than to that of big grains (at 100\n$\\mu$m).

Aged 8 Myr, the Eta Cha cluster is one of the few\nnearby regions within the 5-10 Myr age range, during which the disk fraction\ndecreases dramatically and giant planet formation must come to an end. For the\n15 low-mass members, we measure a disk fraction ~50%, high for their 8 Myr age,\nand 4 of the 8 disks lack near-IR excesses, consistent with the empirical\ndefinition of \"transition'' disks. Most of the disks are comparable to\ngeometrically flat disks. The comparison with regions of different ages\nsuggests that at least some of the \"transition\" disks may represent the normal\ntype of disk around low-mass stars. Therefore, their flattened structure and\ninner holes may be related to other factors (initial masses of the disk and the\nstar, environment, binarity), rather than to pure time evolution. We analyze\nthe silicate dust in the disk atmosphere, finding moderate crystalline\nfractions (~10-30%) and typical grain sizes ~1-3 micron, without any\ncharacteristic trend in the composition. These results are common to other\nregions of different ages, suggesting that the initial grain processing occurs\nvery early in the disk lifetime (<1 Myr). Large grain sizes in the disk\natmosphere cannot be used as a proxy for age, but are likely related to higher\ndisk turbulence. The dust mineralogy varies between the 8-12micron and the\n20-30 micron features, suggesting high temperature dust processing and little\nradial mixing. Finally, the analysis of IR and optical data on the B9 star Eta\nCha reveals that it is probably surrounded by a young debris disk with a large\ninner hole, instead of being a classical Be star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2009 07:46:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

This assumption is probably not realistic as\nindicated by the existence of chemical inhomogeneities, although current\nchemical evolution models of the Milky Way can reproduce the majority of the\nobservational constraints under the IMA. The aim of this paper is to test\nwhether relaxing this approximation in a detailed chemical evolution model can\nimprove or worsen the agreement with observations. To do that, we investigated\ntwo possible causes for relaxing of the instantaneous mixing: i) the ``galactic\nfountain time delay effect'' and ii) the ``metal cooling time delay effect''.\nWe found that the effect of galactic fountains is negligible if an average time\ndelay of 0.1 Gyr, as suggested in a previous paper, is assumed. Longer time\ndelays produce differences in the results but they are not realistic. We also\nfound that the O abundance gradient in the disk is not affected by galactic\nfountains. The metal cooling time delays produce strong effects on the\nevolution of the chemical abundances only if we adopt stellar yields depending\non metallicity. If instead, the yields computed for to the solar chemical\ncomposition are adopted, negligible effects are produced, as in the case of the\ngalactic fountain delay. The relaxation of the IMA by means of the galactic\nfountain model, where the delay is considered only for massive stars and only\nin the disk, does not affect the chemical evolution results. The combination of\nmetal dependent yields and time delay in the chemical enrichment from all stars\nstarting from the halo phase, instead, produces results at variance with\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2009 10:15:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

As gravitational structure formation creates bound\nregions of positive curvature, the regions in between become negatively curved\nin order to comply with a vanishing global curvature. The actual dynamics of\nthe universe is altered due to the self-induced inhomogeneities, again more\nprominently so as structure formation progresses. Furthermore, this negative\ncurvature will increase as a function of time as structure formation proceeds,\nwhich mimics the effect of \"dark energy\" with negative pressure.

The model spectra\nare compared to the observations obtained with the Hectochelle on the MMT\ntelescope. These stars show strong Halpha emissions and blue-shifted Halpha\ncores signaling that mass outflow is present in all stars. Outflow velocities\nof 3-19 km/s, larger than indicated by Halpha profiles, are needed in the upper\nchromosphere to achieve good agreement between the model spectra and the\nobservations. The resulting mass loss rates range from 0.6*10^{-9} to 5*10^{-9}\nMsun/yr, which are about an order of magnitude lower than predicted from\n\"Reimers' law\" or inferred from the infrared excess of similar stars. The mass\nloss rate increases slightly with luminosity and with decreasing effective\ntemperature. Stars in the more metal-rich M13 have higher mass loss rates by a\nfactor of ~2 than in the metal-poor clusters M15 and M92. A fit to the mass\nloss rates is given by: M [Msun/yr] = 0.092 * L^{0.16} * Teff^{-2.02} *\nA^{0.37} where A=10^[Fe/H]. Multiple observations of stars revealed one object\nin M15, K757, in which the mass outflow increased by a factor of 6 between two\nobservations separated by 18 months.

In the ecliptic plane at $\\sim\n1$ AU, this break occurs approximately at timescales of a few hours, and is\nobserved in the power spectra of components of velocity and magnetic field. The\n\"$1/f$\" energy range is of more direct coronal origin than the inertial range,\nand carries signatures of the complex magnetic field structure of the solar\ncorona, and of footpoint stirring in the solar photosphere. To quantify the\nscaling properties we use generic statistical methods such as generalised\nstructure functions and PDFs, focusing on solar cycle dependence and on\nanisotropy with respect to the background magnetic field. We present structure\nfunction analysis of magnetic and velocity field fluctuations, using a novel\ntechnique to decompose the fluctuations into directions parallel and\nperpendicular to the mean local background magnetic field. Whilst the magnetic\nfield is close to \"$1/f$\", we show that the velocity field is \"$1/f^{\\alpha}$\"\nwith $\\alpha\\neq1$. For the velocity, the value of $\\alpha$ varies between\nparallel and perpendicular fluctuations and with the solar cycle. There is also\nvariation in $\\alpha$ with solar wind speed. We have examined the PDFs in the\nfast, quiet solar wind and intriguingly, whilst parallel and perpendicular are\ndistinct, both the ${\\boldmath$B$}$ field and velocity show the same PDF of\ntheir perpendicular flucutations, which is close to gamma or inverse Gumbel.\nThese results point to distinct physical processes in the corona, and to their\nmapping out into the solar wind.

A comparison of the distinct properties of the two halo groups with\nthose of Galactic halo field stars indicates that the clusters of group 1\noriginated in the inner halo, while those of group 2 formed in the outer halo\nof the Galaxy. The inner halo clusters were presumably initially the most\nmassive one, which allowed the formation of more strongly helium-enriched\nsecond generation stars, thus explaining the presence of Cepheids and of very\nhot horizontal-branch stars exclusively in this group. We thus conclude that\nthe \"second parameter\" is linked to the environment in which globular clusters\nform, the inner halo favouring the formation of the most massive clusters which\nsubsequently become more strongly self-enriched than their counterparts of the\ngalactic outer halo and disc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2009 14:53:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-15"}

Quenches are done from easily generated \"stochastic\"\nconfigurations, in which the nuclei are distributed uniformly within a\nconstraint limiting the closeness of approach. For metallic Na with atomic pair\npotential interactions, it is shown that quenches from stochastic\nconfigurations and quenches from equilibrium liquid Molecular Dynamics (MD)\nconfigurations produce statistically identical distributions of the structural\npotential energy. Again for metallic Na, it is shown that DFT quenches from\nstochastic configurations provide the parameters which calibrate the\nHamiltonian.

These devices (nodes) are expected to\noperate autonomously, be battery powered and have very limited computational\ncapabilities. This makes the task of protecting a sensor network against\nmisbehavior or possible malfunction a challenging problem. In this document we\ndiscuss performance of Artificial immune systems (AIS) when used as the\nmechanism for detecting misbehavior.\n  We show that (i) mechanism of the AIS have to be carefully applied in order\nto avoid security weaknesses, (ii) the choice of genes and their interaction\nhave a profound influence on the performance of the AIS, (iii) randomly created\ndetectors do not comply with limitations imposed by communications protocols\nand (iv) the data traffic pattern seems not to impact significantly the overall\nperformance.\n  We identified a specific MAC layer based gene that showed to be especially\nuseful for detection; genes measure a network's performance from a node's\nviewpoint. Furthermore, we identified an interesting complementarity property\nof genes; this property exploits the local nature of sensor networks and moves\nthe burden of excessive communication from normally behaving nodes to\nmisbehaving nodes. These results have a direct impact on the design of AIS for\nsensor networks and on engineering of sensor networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2009 15:31:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

This modification appears to be insufficient\nabove a certain critical value of the corner angle where the numerical solution\nbecomes mesh-dependent. As shown, this is due to an eigensolution, which exists\nfor all angles and becomes dominant for the supercritical ones.
