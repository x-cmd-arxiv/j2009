This\nsignal is dramatically inconsistent with upper limits from other experiments\nfor elastically scattering weak-scale WIMPs. However, the results are\ncompatible for the case of inelastic dark matter (iDM). The iDM theory, as\nimplemented by Tucker-Smith and Weiner, constrains the WIMP to a tight contour\nin sigma_n-delta space, where delta is the mass difference between the ground\nstate and excited WIMPs. An urgent priority in direct detection is to test this\nscenario. The crucial test of the iDM explanation of DAMA -- an \"experimentum\ncrucis\" -- is an experiment with directional sensitivity, which can measure the\ndaily modulation in direction. Because the contrast can be 100%, it is a\nsharper test than the much smaller annual modulation in the rate. We estimate\nthe significance of such an experiment as a function of the WIMP mass, cross\nsection, background rate, and other parameters. The proposed experiment\nseverely constrains the DAMA/iDM scenario even with modest exposure (~1000 kg\nday) on gaseous xenon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2009 19:43:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2010 02:26:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-14"}

First results are promising with nRMSE < 21% and\nRMSE < 998 Wh/m2. Our optimized MLP presents prediction similar to or even\nbetter than conventional methods such as ARIMA techniques, Bayesian inference,\nMarkov chains and k-Nearest-Neighbors approximators. Moreover we found that our\ndata preprocessing approach can reduce significantly forecasting errors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2009 16:02:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-02"}

A\ndeep 190 ks Suzaku observation in February 2007 revealed the complex, broad\nband X-ray spectrum of PDS 456. The Suzaku spectrum exhibits highly\nstatistically significant absorption features near 9 keV in the quasar\nrest--frame. We show that the most plausible origin of the absorption is from\nblue-shifted resonance (1s-2p) transitions of hydrogen-like iron (at 6.97 keV\nin the rest frame). This indicates that a highly ionized outflow may be present\nmoving at near relativistic velocities (~0.25c). A possible hard X-ray excess\nis detected above 15 keV with HXD (at 99.8% confidence), which may arise from\nhigh column density gas (Nh>10^24cm^-2) partially covering the X-ray emission,\nor through strong Compton reflection. Here we propose that the iron K-shell\nabsorption in PDS 456 is associated with a thick, possibly clumpy outflow,\ncovering about 20% of $4\\pi$ steradian solid angle. The outflow is likely\nlaunched from the inner accretion disk, within 15-100 gravitational radii of\nthe black hole. The kinetic power of the outflow may be similar to the\nbolometric luminosity of PDS 456. Such a powerful wind could have a significant\neffect on the co-evolution of the host galaxy and its supermassive black hole,\nthrough feedback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2009 16:10:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-10"}

The stationary phase approximation\nis then employed to obtain explicit analytic expressions for the Fourier\ntransform of the post-circular expanded, time-domain signal. We exemplify this\nframework by considering Newtonian-accurate waveforms, which in the\npost-circular scheme give rise to higher harmonics of the orbital phase and\namplitude corrections both to the amplitude and the phase of the Fourier domain\nwaveform. Such higher harmonics lead to an effective increase in the inspiral\nmass reach of a detector as a function of the binary's eccentricity e_0 at the\ntime when the binary enters the detector sensitivity band. Using the largest\ninitial eccentricity allowed by our approximations (e_0 < 0.4), the mass reach\nis found to be enhanced up to factors of approximately 5 relative to that of\ncircular binaries for Advanced LIGO, LISA, and the proposed Einstein Telescope\nat a signal-to-noise ratio of ten.

On the other hand, from results of experiments that test the Weak\nEquivalence Principle, we find a limit for the model's parameter, that comes\nfrom the variation of the electron mass induced by spatial variations of the\nscalar field. By comparing both limits, we arrive at the conclusion that the\nmodel should be ruled-out. Lastly, we reanalyze the effects of the variation of\n$\\alpha$ or $m_e$ upon planetary radii. We explain why the variation of the\nelectron mass does not induce observable changes on the radii. We present a\nlocal and independent bound on the variation of $\\alpha$, obtained from very\ngeneral statements.

The effect of varying\nthreshold is not important, but varying stepsize produces a different effect\nfor 2D and 3D cases. In the 2D case, where emission is relatively isolated\n(associated with only the densest peaks in the cloud), the mass spectrum\nvariability is negligible compared to the mass function fit uncertainties. In\nthe 3D case, however, where the 13CO emission traces the bulk of the molecular\ncloud, the number of clumps and the derived mass spectrum are highly correlated\nwith the stepsize used. The distinction between \"2D\" and \"3D\" here is more\nimportantly also a distinction between \"sparse\" and \"crowded\" emission. In any\n\"crowded\" case, Clumpfind should not be used blindly to derive mass functions.\nClumpfind's output in the \"crowded\" case can still offer a statistical\ndescription of emission useful in inter-comparisons, but the clump-list should\nnot be treated as a robust region decomposition suitable to generate a\nphysically-meaningful mass function. We conclude that the 13CO mass spectrum\ndepends on the observations resolution, due to the hierarchical structure of\nMC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2009 18:34:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-22"}

This problem force us to\nimplement post-facto image restoration techniques that, added to the real-time\ncorrections performed by the Adaptive Optics, gives us images closer to\nreality. To have good solar observations overcoming the negative influence of\nthe Earth' s atmosphere, one effort is being made with the development of the\nSunrise mission. This project consists in a balloon-borne mission that will\nlaunch a 1-m telescope to the stratosphere and will record data with\nunprecedented temporal, spatial and spectral resolution. The main aim of\nSunrise is to study the formation of magnetic structures in the solar\natmosphere and their interaction with the convective plasma flows. The on-board\ninstrument Imaging Magnetograph eXperiment (IMaX) will be able to produce\nmagnetic field maps of extensive solar regions by measuring the light\npolarization in certain spectral lines. As a member of the IMaX team, I have\ndeveloped an in-flight calibration method to characterize the aberrations\naffecting the images in IMaX.

Here, we\nidentify a hitherto unrecognized problem with this technique, related to how\nthe night sky flux is typically measured and subtracted from astronomical\nimages. While most of the sky flux comes from regions between the observer and\nthe target object, a small fraction - the extragalactic background light (EBL)\n- comes from behind. We argue that since this part of the sky flux can be\nsubject to extinction by dust present in the galaxy/group/cluster studied,\nstandard reduction procedures may lead to a systematic oversubtraction of the\nEBL. Even very small amounts of extinction can lead to spurious features in\nradial surface surface brightness profiles and colour maps of extended objects.\nWe assess the likely impact of this effect on a number of topics in\nextragalactic astronomy where very deep surface photometry is currently\nattempted, including studies of stellar halos, starburst host galaxies, disc\ntruncations and diffuse intragroup/intracluster light. We argue that EBL\nextinction may provide at least a partial explanation for the anomalously red\ncolours reported for the halos of disc galaxies and the hosts of local\nstarburst galaxies. EBL extinction effects also mimic truncations in discs with\nunusually high dust opacities, but are unlikely to be the cause of such\nfeatures in general. Failure to account for EBL extinction can also give rise\nto a non-negligible underestimate of intragroup and intracluster light at the\nfaintest surface brightness levels currently probed.

A total of 29\nUV-grism and 22 V-grism spectra of 9 supernovae (SNe) have been collected, of\nwhich 6 are thermonuclear (type Ia) and 3 core collapse (type Ibc/II) SNe. All\nthe spectra have been obtained during the photospheric phase. After a\ncomparison of the spectra of our sample with those in the literature (SNe\n1992A, 1990N and 1999em), we confirm some degree of diversity in the UV\nemission of Type Ia SNe and a greater homogeneity in the Type II Plateau SN\nsample. Signatures of interaction between the ejecta and the circumstellar\nenvironment have been found in the UV spectrum of SN 2006jc, the only SN Type\nIb/c for which UVOT grism data are available. Currently, Swift UVOT is the best\nsuited instrument for early SN studies in the UV due to its fast response and\nflexible scheduling capabilities. However, in order to increase the quality of\nthe data and significantly improve our understanding of the UV properties of\nSNe and to fully maximize the scientific potential of UVOT grism observations,\na larger investment in observing time and longer exposures are needed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2009 20:00:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-22"}

In this paper, we rewrite the upper\nbound record to 2.5545. Our idea for the improvement is as follows. In SODA\n2002 \\cite{SS03}, Seiden and van Stee proposed an elegant algorithm called $H\n\\otimes B$, comprised of the {\\em Harmonic algorithm} $H$ and the {\\em Improved\nHarmonic algorithm} $B$, for the two-dimensional online bin packing problem and\nproved that the algorithm has an asymptotic competitive ratio of at most\n2.66013. Since the best known online algorithm for one-dimensional bin packing\nis the {\\em Super Harmonic algorithm} \\cite{S02}, a natural question to ask is:\ncould a better upper bound be achieved by using the Super Harmonic algorithm\ninstead of the Improved Harmonic algorithm? However, as mentioned in\n\\cite{SS03}, the previous analysis framework does not work. In this paper, we\ngive a positive answer for the above question. A new upper bound of 2.5545 is\nobtained for 2-dimensional online bin packing.

The purpose of this work is to study the\npulsed component, that is the light-curves as well as the spectra of the\nhigh-energy emission, above 10 MeV, emanating from the striped wind model.\nGamma rays are produced by scattering off the soft cosmic microwave background\nphotons on the ultrarelativistic leptons flowing in the current sheets.

A central question is how to characterize the binding\naffinity of these membrane-anchored molecules. For soluble molecules, the\nbinding affinity is typically quantified by the binding equilibrium constant\nK3D in the linear relation [RL] = K3D [R][L] between the volume concentration\n[RL] of bound complexes and the volume concentrations [R] and [L] of unbound\nmolecules. For membrane-anchored molecules, it is often assumed by analogy that\nthe area concentration of bound complexes [RL] is proportional to the product\n[R][L] of the area concentrations for the unbound receptor and ligand\nmolecules. We show here (i) that this analogy is only valid for two planar\nmembranes immobilized on rigid surfaces, and (ii) that the thermal roughness of\nflexible membranes leads to cooperative binding of receptors and ligands. In\nthe case of flexible membranes, the area concentration [RL] of receptor-ligand\nbonds is proportional to the square of [R][L] for typical lengths and\nconcentrations of receptors and ligands in cell adhesion zones.

Empty space is filled with vacuum energy due to matter fields in\ntheir ground state and represents an underlying environment that any quantum\nparticle has to cope with. In particular quantum gravity vacuum fluctuations\nshould represent a universal source of decoherence. To study this problem we\nemploy a stochastic approach that models spacetime fluctuations close to the\nPlanck scale by means of a classical, randomly fluctuating metric (random\ngravity framework). We enrich the classical scheme for metric perturbations\nover a curved background by also including matter fields and metric conformal\nfluctuations. We show in general that a conformally modulated metric induces\ndephasing as a result of an effective nonlinear newtonian potential obtained in\nthe appropriate nonrelativistic limit of a minimally coupled Klein-Gordon\nfield. The special case of vacuum fluctuations is considered and a quantitative\nestimate of the expected effect deduced. Secondly we address the question of\nhow conformal fluctuations could physically arise. By applying the random\ngravity framework we first show that standard GR seems to forbid spontaneous\nconformal metric modulations. Finally we argue that a different result follows\nwithin scalar-tensor theories of gravity such as e.g. Brans-Dicke theory. In\nthis case a conformal modulation of the metric arises naturally as a result of\nthe fluctuations in the Brans-Dicke field and quantum dephasing of a test\nparticle is expected to occur. For large negative values of the coupling\nparameter the conformal fluctuations may also contribute to alleviate the well\nknown problem of the large zero point energy due to quantum matter fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2009 11:36:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2009 13:15:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-26"}

The interface can be physical, as in multi-physics and contact\nproblems, or purely numerical, as in the coupling of non-conforming meshes. The\nmost critical part of the modeling process is to ensure geometric compatibility\nand a complete transfer of surface tractions between the different components\nat the connecting interfaces. Popular contact modeling techniques rely on\ngeometric projections to detect and resolve overlapping or mass\ninterpenetration between two or more contacting bodies. Such approaches have\nbeen shown to have two major drawbacks: they are not suitable for contact at\nhighly nonlinear surfaces and sharp corners where smooth normal projections are\nnot feasible, and they fail to guarantee a complete and accurate transfer of\npressure across the interface. This dissertation presents a novel formulation\nfor the modeling of contact problems that possesses the ability to resolve\ncomplicated contact scenarios effectively, while being simpler to implement and\nmore widely applicable than currently available methods. We show that the\nformulation boils down to a node-to-surface gap function that works effectively\nfor non-smooth contact. The numerical implementation using the midpoint rule\nshows the need to guarantee the conservation of the total energy during impact,\nfor which a Lagrange multiplier method is used. We propose a local enrichment\nof the interface and a simple stabilization procedure based on the\ndiscontinuous Galerkin method to guarantee an accurate transfer of the pressure\nfield.

The new techniques\npresented here fail to recover the input proximity effect in an un-biased way.\nThus, employing complex 3D simulations, we provide strong evidence in favor of\nthe proximity effect strength distribution obtained from the simple averaging\ntechnique, as method of estimating the UV background intensity, free of any\nbiases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2009 15:31:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Sep 2010 07:38:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-12"}

In this model the memory\nsystem of an equipment works as a dynamical system perturbed by noise.\nInterference patterns correspond to attractors of RDS. There exists a large\nclass of $p$-adic RDS for which interference patterns cannot be disturbed by\nnoise. Therefore, if the equipment is described by such a RDS then the result\nof statistical experiment does not depend on noise in the equipment. On the one\nhand, we support the corpuscular model, because a quantum particle can be\ndescribed as a corpuscular object. On the other hand, our model does not differ\nstrongly from the wave model, because a quantum particle interacts with the\nwhole equipment. Hence the interaction has nonlocal character. For example, in\nthe two slit experiment a quantum particle interacts with both slits (but it\npasses only one of them).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2009 15:41:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-03"}

Brightwell\nand Trotter proved that the dimension of the vertex-edge-face poset $\\Pvef{M}$\nof a planar map $M$ is at most four. In this paper we investigate cases where\n$\\dim(\\Pvef{M}) \\leq 3$ and also where $\\dim(\\Qvf{M}) \\leq 3$; here $\\Qvf{M}$\ndenotes the vertex-face poset of $M$. We show: - If $M$ contains a\n$K_4$-subdivision, then $\\dim(\\Pvef{M}) = \\dim(\\Qvf{M}) = 4$. - If $M$ or the\ndual $M^*$ contains a $K_{2,3}$-subdivision, then $\\dim(\\Pvef{M}) = 4$. Hence,\na map $M$ with $\\dim(\\Pvef{M}) \\leq 3$ must be outerplanar and have an\nouterplanar dual. We concentrate on the simplest class of such maps and prove\nthat within this class $\\dim(\\Pvef{M}) \\leq 3$ is equivalent to the existence\nof a certain oriented coloring of edges. This condition is easily checked and\ncan be turned into a linear time algorithm returning a 3-realizer.\nAdditionally, we prove that if $M$ is 2-connected and $M$ and $M^*$ are\nouterplanar, then $\\dim(\\Qvf{M}) \\leq 3$. There are, however, outerplanar maps\nwith $\\dim(\\Qvf{M}) = 4$. We construct the first such example.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2009 15:42:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-03"}
