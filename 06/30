Instead, the graviton appears\nmerely as a tensor bound state of two gamma bosons in the same spin eigenstate,\nby referring to the relation g_mu nu = 1/2 (gamma_mu gamma_nu + gamma_nu\ngamma_mu) and the metric ds^2 = g_mu nu dx^mu dx^nu = (gamma_alpha dx^alpha)^2.\nConsequently, like the electroweak theory and quantum chromodynamics, gravity\nmay be formalized as a Yang-Mills theory.

One of the critical assumptions often made\nis that the diffusion of fluid molecules is sufficiently fast to warrant the\ncondition for direct mapping between the surface-enhanced relaxation rate and\nthe pore geometry. In pores satisfying such a condition, but having a\nsignificant spatial variation of surface relaxivity (rho), one can show that\nthe one-to-one mapping may break down. The degree to which the NMR logging\ninterpretation is affected has not been systematically studied until now. In\nthis work, we theoretically investigate the interplay between the pore\ngeometry, internal field and the inhomogeneous surface relaxivity. We develop a\nperturbative framework and compare its results with exact solutions obtained\nfor a class of rho textures in a pore with simple geometry. Its effect is\nquantified for a wide range of diffusivity and/or rho strength. The result\nallows us to set the bounds for the change in the final slope of the relaxation\ncurve and may serve as a useful guide for logging applications in real rocks\nwith a wide range of pore sizes and fluid diffusivity.

We add an additional SU(2) Higgs doublet and three SU(2) fermion\ntriplets in our model. The presence of two Higgs doublets allows for natural\nexplanation of small neutrino masses with triplet fermions in the 100 GeV mass\nrange, without fine tuning of the Yukawa couplings to extremely small values.\nThe triplet fermions couple to the gauge bosons and can be thus produced at the\nLHC. We study in detail the effective cross-sections for the production and\nsubsequent decays of these heavy exotic fermions. We show for the first time\nthat the $\\mu$-$\\tau$ flavor symmetry in the low energy neutrino mass matrix\nresults in mixing matrices for the neutral and charged heavy fermions that are\nnot unity and which carry the flavor symmetry pattern. This flavor structure\ncan be observed in the decays of the heavy fermions at LHC. The large Yukawa\ncouplings in our model result in the decay of the heavy fermions into lighter\nleptons and Higgs with a decay rate which is about $10^{11}$ times larger than\nwhat is expected for the one Higgs Type III seesaw model with 100 GeV triplet\nfermions. The smallness of neutrino masses constrains the neutral Higgs mixing\nangle $\\sin\\alpha$ in our model in such a way that the heavy fermions decay\ninto the lighter neutral CP even Higgs $h^0$, CP odd Higgs $A^0$ and the\ncharged Higgs $H^\\pm$, but almost never to the heavier neutral CP even Higgs\n$H^0$. The small value for $\\sin\\alpha$ also results in a very long lifetime\nfor $h^0$. This displaced decay vertex should be visible at LHC. We provide an\nexhaustive list of collider signature channels for our model and identify those\nthat have very large effective cross-sections at LHC and almost no standard\nmodel background.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2009 18:30:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-07"}

We find that the Milky Way's merger history must have been unusually\nquiescent compared to median LCDM expectations and therefore its dark disk must\nbe relatively small: the fraction of accreted dark disk material near the Sun\nis about 20% of the host halo density or smaller and the co-rotating dark\nmatter fraction near the Sun, defined as particles moving with a rotational\nvelocity lag less than 50 km/s, is enhanced by about 30% or less compared to a\nstandard halo model. Such a dark disk could contribute dominantly to the low\nenergy (of order keV for a dark matter particle with mass 100 GeV) nuclear\nrecoil event rate of direct dectection experiments, but it will not change the\nlikelihood of detection significantly. These dark disks provide testable\npredictions of weakly-interacting massive particle dark matter models and\nshould be considered in detailed comparisons to experimental data. Our findings\nsuggest that the dark disk of the Milky Way may provide a detectable signal for\nindirect detection experiments, contributing up to about 25% of the dark matter\nself-annihilation signal in the direction of the center of the Galaxy, lending\nthe signal a noticeably oblate morphology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2009 00:19:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

A\nprevious study of shearing boxes with zero net magnetic field performed with\nthe ZEUS code found that turbulence dies out for values of the magnetic Prandtl\nnumber, P_m = \\nu/\\eta, below P_m \\sim 1; for P_m \\gtrsim 1, time- and\nvolume-averaged stress levels increase with P_m.

By applying a range of values for \\nu and\n\\eta to an initial state consisting of fully developed turbulence in the\npresence of a background toroidal field, we investigate their effects in the\nfully nonlinear system.

In the most\nluminous starbursts, the GMC lifetime is shorter than the main sequence\nlifetime of even the most massive stars, so that supernovae can play no role in\nGMC disruption. We investigate the disruption of GMCs across a wide range of\ngalaxies, from normal spirals to the densest starbursts; we take into account\nthe effects of HII gas pressure, shocked stellar winds, protostellar jets, and\nradiation pressure produced by the absorption and scattering of starlight on\ndust grains. In the Milky Way, we find that a combination of three mechanisms,\njets, HII gas pressure, and radiation pressure, disrupts the clouds. In more\nrapidly star forming galaxies such as ``clump'' galaxies at high-redshift,\nultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) and submillimeter galaxies, radiation\npressure dominates natal cloud distribution.

The 800 ksec\nexposure of the deep Chandra VLP program allows us to reach a limiting\nluminosity of 8e35 erg/s, about 2-3 times deeper than previous investigations.\nWe confirm the presence of the low luminosity break in the overall LMXB XLF at\nlog(L_X)=37.2-37.6 below which the luminosity distribution follows a constant\ndN/d(ln L). Separating globular cluster and field sources, we find a\nstatistically significant difference between the two luminosity distributions\nwith a relative underabundance of faint sources in the globular cluster\npopulation. This demonstrates that the samples are drawn from distinct parent\npopulations and may disprove the hypothesis that the entire LMXB population in\nearly type galaxies is created dynamically in globular clusters. As a plausible\nexplanation for this difference in the XLFs, we suggest that there is an\nenhanced fraction of helium accreting systems in globular clusters, which are\ncreated in collisions between red giants and neutron stars. Due to the 4 times\nhigher ionization temperature of He, such systems are subject to accretion disk\ninstabilities at approximately 20 times higher mass accretion rate, and\ntherefore are not observed as persistent sources at low luminosities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2009 09:25:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-10"}

This result is a natural generalization of the\ncelebrated max-flow min-cut theorem for wired networks. Second, we use the\ninsights obtained from the deterministic analysis to design a new\nquantize-map-and-forward scheme for Gaussian networks. In this scheme, each\nrelay quantizes the received signal at the noise level and maps it to a random\nGaussian codeword for forwarding, and the final destination decodes the\nsource's message based on the received signal. We show that, in contrast to\nexisting schemes, this scheme can achieve the cut-set upper bound to within a\ngap which is independent of the channel parameters. In the case of the relay\nchannel with a single relay as well as the two-relay Gaussian diamond network,\nthe gap is 1 bit/s/Hz. Moreover, the scheme is universal in the sense that the\nrelays need no knowledge of the values of the channel parameters to\n(approximately) achieve the rate supportable by the network.

We anticipate that\nmeasuring the spin of black holes by using QPOs will open a new window for\nexploring the evolution of black holes in the Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2009 07:24:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Jan 2010 04:11:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

However, it remains unclear\nhow and where coronal heating occurs and how the corona is filled with hot\nplasma. We show that energy deposition at coronal heights cannot be the only\nsource of coronal heating, by revealing a significant coronal mass supply\nmechanism that is driven from below, in the chromosphere. We quantify the\nasymmetry of spectral lines observed with Hinode and SOHO and identify faint\nbut ubiquitous upflows with velocities that are similar (50-100 km/s) across a\nwide range of magnetic field configurations and for temperatures from 100,000\nto several million degrees. These upflows are spatio-temporally correlated with\nand have similar upward velocities as recently discovered, cool (10,000 K)\nchromospheric jets or (type II) spicules. We find these upflows to be pervasive\nand universal. Order of magnitude estimates constrained by conservation of mass\nand observed emission measures indicate that the mass supplied by these\nspicules can play a significant role in supplying the corona with hot plasma.\nThe properties of these events are incompatible with coronal loop models that\nonly include nanoflares at coronal heights.

H2 forms a thin\nnuclear disk in the inner ~ 5 pc, which is surrounded by molecular clouds\nswelled up toward h < 10 pc. The velocity field of the disk is highly turbulent\nin the torus region, whose velocity dispersion is ~ 20 km/s on average.

However, some parts of the flux tube become unstable and\nexpand in patches into the upper chromosphere. The flux rapidly expands towards\nthe corona, pushing the coronal and transition region material aside, lifting\nand maintaining the transition region at heights greater than 5 Mm above the\nphotosphere for extensive periods of time. The pre-existing magnetic field in\nthe corona and transition region is perturbed by the incoming flux and\nreoriented by a series of high Joule heating events. Low density structures\nform in the corona while at later times a high density filamentary structure\nappears in the lower part of the expanding flux. The dynamics of these and\nother structures is discussed. While Joule heating due to the expanding flux is\nepisodic, it increases in relative strength as fresh magnetic field rises and\nbecomes energetically important in the upper chromosphere and corona at later\ntimes. Chromospheric, transition region and coronal lines are computed and\ntheir response to the perturbation caused by the expanding emerging flux is\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2009 10:29:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-11"}

Optical\nstudies of XDINSs thus play a crucial role in mapping the temperature\ndistribution on the neutron star surface and in investigating the existence of\nan atmosphere around the neutron star. The aim of this work is to investigate\nthe optical identification of the XDINS RX J0420.0-5022, tentatively proposed\nby Haberl et al. (2004) based on VLT observations. We re-analysed the original\nobservations of Haberl et al. to assess the detection significance of the\nproposed counterpart and we performed deeper VLT observations aiming at a\nhigher confidence detection. With a ~2 sigma detection significance and a\nre-computed flux of B=27.52+/-0.61, we can not rule out that the proposed\ncounterpart was spurious and produced by the halo of a very bright nearby star.\nWhile we could not detect the proposed counterpart in our deeper VLT\nobservations, we found evidence for a marginally significant (~3.9 sigma)\ndetection of a similarly faint object (B= 27.5+/-0.3), ~ 0.5\" north of it and\ncoincident with the updated Chandra position of RX J0420.0-5022. Interestingly,\nthe angular separation is consistent with the upper limit on the RX\nJ0420.0-5022 proper motion (Motch et al. 2009), which suggests that we might\nhave actually detected the Haberl et al. proposed counterpart. From the flux of\nthe putative RX J0420.0-5022 counterpart we can rule out a > 7 optical excess\nwith respect to the extrapolation of the XMM-Newton spectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2009 11:14:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

In this approach, a random directed graph is constructed\nfrom the data using the relative positions of the points from various classes.\nDifferent random graphs result from different definitions of the proximity\nregion associated with each data point and different graph statistics can be\nemployed for pattern testing. The approach used in this article is based on\nunderlying graphs of a family of data-random digraphs which is determined by a\nfamily of parameterized proximity maps. The relative edge density of the AND-\nand OR-underlying graphs is used as the summary statistic, providing an\nalternative to the relative arc density and domination number of the digraph\nemployed previously. Properly scaled, relative edge density of the underlying\ngraphs is a U-statistic, facilitating analytic study of its asymptotic\ndistribution using standard U-statistic central limit theory. The approach is\nillustrated with an application to the testing of bivariate spatial clustering\npatterns of segregation and association. Knowledge of the asymptotic\ndistribution allows evaluation of the Pitman asymptotic efficiency, hence\nselection of the proximity map parameter to optimize efficiency. Asymptotic\nefficiency and Monte Carlo simulation analysis indicate that the AND-underlying\nversion is better (in terms of power and efficiency) for the segregation\nalternative, while the OR-underlying version is better for the association\nalternative.

The thin disk equations are solved\nwith proper opacities for dust and gas taking into account the huge temperature\nvariation along the disk. We explore a wide parameter range concerning stellar\nmass, accretion rate, and viscosity parameter \\alpha . The most essential\nfinding is a very high temperature of the inner disk. For e.g. a 10 M_sun\nprotostar and an accretion rate of 10^-4 M_sun/yr, the disk midplane\ntemperature may reach almost 10^5 K. The disk luminosity in this case is about\n10^4 L_sun and, thus, potentially higher than that of a massive protostar. We\nmotivate our disk model with similarly hot disks around compact stars. We\ncalculate a dust sublimation radius by turbulent disk self-heating of more than\n10AU, a radius, which is 3 times larger than caused by stellar irradiation. We\ndiscuss implications of this result on the flashlight effect and the\nconsequences for the radiation pressure of the central star. In difference to\ndisks around low mass protostars our models suggest rather high values for the\ndisk turbulence parameter \\alpha close to unity. However, disk stability to\nfragmentation due to thermal effects and gravitational instability would\nrequire a lower \\alpha value. For \\alpha = 0.1 we find stable disks out to\n80AU.

Our goal was to return to Beta Pic five years later to obtain a\nsecond-epoch observation of the companion or, in case of a non-detection,\nconstrain its orbit. Deep adaptive-optics L'-band direct images of Beta Pic and\nKs-band Four-Quadrant-Phase-Mask (4QPM) coronagraphic images were recorded with\nNaCo in January and February 2009. We also use 4QPM data taken in November\n2004. No point-like signal with the brightness of the companion candidate\n(apparent magnitudes L'=11.2 or Ks ~ 12.5) is detected at projected distances\ndown to 6.5 AU from the star in the 2009 data. As expected, the non-detection\ndoes not allow to rule out a background object; however, we show that it is\nconsistent with the orbital motion of a bound companion that got closer to the\nstar since first observed in 2003 and that is just emerging from behind the\nstar at the present epoch. We place strong constraints on the possible orbits\nof the companion and discuss future observing prospects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2009 13:48:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2009 14:37:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

We find that while strain alone does not produce a\ngap in the BLG, an electric field does so in the Bernal structure but not in\nthe hexagonal structure. The topology of the bands leads to Dirac circles with\nlinear dispersion in the case of the hexagonally stacked BLG due to the\ninterpenetration of the Dirac cones, while for the Bernal stacking, the\ndispersion is quadratic. The size of the Dirac circle increases with the\napplied electric field, leading to an interesting way of controlling the Fermi\nsurface.

We find that the fraction of\nabsorbed (NH > 10^{22} cm^2) sources is 43% while the Compton thick AGN\ncomprise 7% of the sample. While these estimates are fully compatible with\nprevious soft gamma-ray surveys, they would appear to be in contrast with\nresults reported by Risaliti et al. (1999) using an optically selected sample.\nThis apparent difference can be explained as being due to a selection bias\ncaused by the reduction in high energy flux in Compton thick objects rendering\nthem invisible at our sensitivity limit. Taking this into account we estimate\nthat the fraction of highly absorbed sources is actually in close agreement\nwith the optically selected sample. Furthermore we show that the measured\nfraction of absorbed sources in our sample decreases from 80% to about 20-30%\nas a function of redshift with all Compton thick AGN having z < 0.015. If we\nlimit our analysis to this distance and compare only the type 2 objects in our\nsample with the Risaliti et al. objects below this redshift value, we find a\nperfect match to their NH distribution. We conclude that in the low redshift\nbin we are seeing almost the entire AGN population, from unabsorbed to at least\nmildly Compton thick objects, while in the total sample we lose the heavily\nabsorbed 'counterparts' of distant and therefore dim sources with little or no\nabsorption. Taking therefore this low z bin as the only one able to provide the\n'true' distribution of absorption in type 1 and 2 AGN, we estimate the fraction\nof Compton thick objects to be >24%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2009 14:36:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Cox and Wermuth\n(2003) introduced the concept of distribution dependence between two random\nvariables X and Y, and developed two dependence conditions, each of which\nguarantees that reversal cannot occur. Ma, Xie and Geng (2006) studied the\ncollapsibility of distribution dependence over a background variable W, under a\nrather strong homogeneity condition. Collapsibility ensures the association\nremains the same for conditional and marginal models, so that Yule-Simpson\nreversal cannot occur. In this paper, we investigate a more general condition\nfor avoiding effect reversal: A-collapsibility. The conditions of Cox and\nWermuth imply A-collapsibility, without assuming homogeneity. In fact, we show\nthat, when W is a binary variable, collapsibility is equivalent to\nA-collapsibility plus homogeneity, and A-collapsibility is equivalent to the\nconditions of Cox and Wermuth. Recently, Cox (2007) extended Cochran's result\non regression coefficients of conditional and marginal models, to quantile\nregression coefficients. The conditions of Cox and Wermuth are sufficient for\nA-collapsibility of quantile regression coefficients. If the conditional\ndistribution of W, given Y = y and X = x, belong to one-dimensional natural\nexponential family, they are also necessary. Some applications of\nA-collapsibility include the analysis of a contingency table, linear regression\nmodels and quantile regression models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2009 14:39:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Aug 2010 09:43:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2011 07:55:26 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 8 Oct 2011 14:34:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-11"}

Its\nvalidity is supported by the cosmic censorship conjecture and therefore its\nproof (or disproof) is an important problem in relation with gravitational\ncollapse. The Penrose inequality is a very challenging problem in mathematical\nrelativity and it has received continuous attention since its formulation by\nPenrose in the early seventies. Important breakthroughs have been made in the\nlast decade or so, with the complete resolution of the so-called Riemannian\nPenrose inequality and a very interesting proposal to address the general case\nby Bray and Khuri. In this paper, the most important results on this field will\nbe discussed and the main ideas behind their proofs will be summarized, with\nthe aim of presenting what is the status of our present knowledge in this\ntopic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2009 15:54:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-02"}

The model alleviates the tension between\nobtaining the correct top quark mass and keeping Delta rho small that exists in\nmany Higgsless models. It does so by singling out the top quark mass generation\nas arising from a Yukawa coupling to an effective top-Higgs which develops a\nsmall vacuum expectation value, while electroweak symmetry breaking results\nlargely from a Higgsless mechanism. As a result, the heavy partners of the\nstandard model fermions can be light enough to be seen at the LHC. After\npresenting the model, we detail the phenomenology, showing that for a broad\nrange of masses, these heavy fermions are discoverable at the LHC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2009 15:56:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Jul 2009 14:58:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2009 17:28:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-02"}
