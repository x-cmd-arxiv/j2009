We first match to a lower energy effective theory in which we\ncalculate the amplitudes in the high energy region.

We estimate monthly\nPM during 1988--2002 in a large spatial domain for use in studying health\neffects in the Nurses' Health Study. We develop a conceptually simple\nspatio-temporal model that uses a rich set of covariates. The model is used to\nestimate concentrations of $PM_{10}$ for the full time period and $PM_{2.5}$\nfor a subset of the period. For the earlier part of the period, 1988--1998, few\n$PM_{2.5}$ monitors were operating, so we develop a simple extension to the\nmodel that represents $PM_{2.5}$ conditionally on $PM_{10}$ model predictions.\nIn the epidemiological analysis, model predictions of $PM_{10}$ are more\nstrongly associated with health effects than when using simpler approaches to\nestimate exposure. Our modeling approach supports the application in estimating\nboth fine-scale and large-scale spatial heterogeneity and capturing space--time\ninteraction through the use of monthly-varying spatial surfaces. At the same\ntime, the model is computationally feasible, implementable with standard\nsoftware, and readily understandable to the scientific audience.

We simultaneously fit\nfor four parameters, black hole mass, dark halo core radius, dark halo circular\nvelocity, and stellar mass-to-light ratio. We find a black hole mass of\n6.4(+-0.5)x10^9 Msun(the uncertainty is 68% confidence marginalized over the\nother parameters). The stellar M/L_V=6.3+-0.8. The best-fitted dark halo core\nradius is 14+-2 kpc, assuming a cored logarithmic potential. The best-fitted\ndark halo circular velocity is 715+-15 km/s. Our black hole mass is over a\nfactor of 2 larger than previous stellar dynamical measures, and our derived\nstellar M/L ratio is 2 times lower than previous dynamical measures. When we do\nnot include a dark halo, we measure a black hole mass and stellar M/L ratio\nthat is consistent with previous measures, implying that the major difference\nis in the model assumptions. The stellar M/L ratio from our models is very\nsimilar to that derived from stellar population models of M87. The reason for\nthe difference in the black hole mass is because we allow the M/L ratio to\nchange with radius. The dark halo is degenerate with the stellar M/L ratio,\nwhich is subsequently degenerate with the black hole mass. We argue that\ndynamical models of galaxies that do not include the contribution from a dark\nhalo may produce a biased result for the black hole mass. This bias is\nespecially large for a galaxy with a shallow light profile such as M87, and may\nnot be as severe in galaxies with steeper light profiles unless they have a\nlarge stellar population change with radius.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jun 2009 13:22:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2009 08:29:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-24"}

The\nequilibrium distribution of wealth is explicitly calculated and its shape\ncrucially depends on market incompleteness. In particular, a Paretian law in\nthe top tail only arises if capital markets are incomplete. The Pareto exponent\ndepends on the saving rate, on the net return on capital, on the growth rate of\npopulation and on portfolio diversification. On the contrary, the\ncharacteristics of the labour market mostly affects the bottom tail of the\ndistribution of wealth. The analysis also suggests a positive relationship\nbetween growth and wealth inequality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jun 2009 14:51:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-11"}
