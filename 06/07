The purpose of this paper is to provide\ntheoretical justifications for the use of bootstrap as a semiparametric\ninferential tool. We show that, under general conditions, the bootstrap is\nasymptotically consistent in estimating the distribution of the $M$-estimate of\nEuclidean parameter; that is, the bootstrap distribution asymptotically\nimitates the distribution of the $M$-estimate. We also show that the bootstrap\nconfidence set has the asymptotically correct coverage probability. These\ngeneral conclusions hold, in particular, when the nuisance parameter is not\nestimable at root-$n$ rate, and apply to a broad class of bootstrap methods\nwith exchangeable bootstrap weights.

We present a\nMaximum Likelihood method for fitting parametric functional forms to halo\nabundances which differs from previous work because it does not require binned\ncounts. Our conclusions do not depend on whether we use our method or more\nconventional ones. In addition, halo abundances depend on how halos are\ndefined. Our conclusions do not depend on the choice of link length associated\nwith the friends-of-friends halo-finder, nor do they change if we identify\nhalos using a spherical overdensity algorithm instead. The large scale halo\nbias measured from the matter-halo cross spectrum b_x and the halo\nautocorrelation function b_xi (on scales k~0.03h/Mpc and r ~50 Mpc/h) can\ndiffer by as much as 5% for halos that are significantly more massive than the\ncharacteristic mass M*. At these large masses, the peak background split\nestimate of the linear bias factor b1 is 3-5% smaller than b_xi, which is 5%\nsmaller than b_x.

The procedure starts\nwith dividing the Hilbert space into two subspaces, the low-energy part (\"$d$\nspace'') and the rest of the space (\"$r$ space''). The low-energy model is\nconstructed for the $d$ space by eliminating the degrees of freedom of the $r$\nspace. The thus derived model contains the strength of electron correlation\nexpressed by a partially screened Coulomb interaction, calculated in the\nconstrained random-phase-approximation (cRPA) where screening channels within\nthe $d$ space, $P_d$, are subtracted. One conceptual problem of this\nestablished downfolding method is that for entangled bands it is not clear how\nto cut out the $d$ space and how to distinguish $P_d$ from the total\npolarization. Here, we propose a simple procedure to overcome this difficulty.\nIn our scheme, the $d$ subspace is cut out from the Hilbert space of the Kohn\nSham eigenfunctions with the help of a procedure to construct a localized\nWannier basis. The $r$ subspace is constructed as the complementary space\northogonal to the $d$ subspace. After this disentanglement, $P_d$ becomes well\ndefined. Using the disentangled bands, the effective parameters are uniquely\ndetermined in the cRPA. The method is successfully applied to 3$d$ transition\nmetals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Jun 2009 09:54:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-20"}

However, SGA contain two components which leave some space\nfor improvement: building of a spanning tree and searching for an independent\nset in a graph. In the hope of obtaining even better heuristic, we tried to\nreplace both of these components with some equivalent algorithms.\n  We tried to use a fixed-parameter algorithm instead of a greedy one for\nsearching of an independent set. But even the exact solution of this subproblem\nimproved the whole heuristic insignificantly. Hence, the crucial part of SGA is\nbuilding of a spanning tree. We tried three different algorithms, and it\nappears that the Depth-First search is clearly superior to the other ones in\nbuilding of the spanning tree for SGA.\n  Thereby, by application of fixed-parameter algorithms, we managed to check\nthat the existing SGA heuristic is of a high quality and selected the component\nwhich required an improvement.
