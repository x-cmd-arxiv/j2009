The condition for the existence of zero modes is\nanalytically derived. From the condition, it is found that a tiny anisotropy\nfor graphene is sufficient to open a gap around zero energy in a magnetic\nfield. This gap behaves as a non-perturbative and exponential form as a\nfunction of the magnetic field. The non-analytic behavior with respect to the\nmagnetic field can be understood as tunneling effects between energy levels\naround two Dirac zero modes appearing in the honeycomb lattice, and an explicit\nform of the gap around zero energy is obtained by the WKB method near the\nmerging point of these Dirac zero modes. Effects of the anisotropy for the\nhoneycomb lattices with boundaries are also studied. The condition for the\nexistence of zero energy edge states in a magnetic field is analytically\nderived. On the basis of the condition, it is recognized that anisotropy of the\nhopping integrals induces abrupt changes of the number of zero energy edge\nstates, which depend on the shapes of the edges sensitively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2009 05:42:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Aug 2009 05:24:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-10"}

The properties of the Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) RX J0852.0-4622\nare theoretically analysed.\n  Methods. An explicitly time-dependent, nonlinear kinetic model of cosmic ray\n(CR) acceleration in SNRs is used to describe the properties of SNR RX\nJ0852.0-4622, the accelerated CRs and the nonthermal emission. The source is\nassumed to be at a distance of ~1 kpc in the wind bubble of a massive\nprogenitor star. An estimate of the thermal X-ray flux in such a configuration\nis given.\n  Results. We find that the overall synchrotron spectrum of RX J0852.0-4622 as\nwell as the filamentary structures in hard X-rays lead to an amplified magnetic\nfield B > 100 muG in the SNR interior. This implies that the leptonic very high\nenergy (VHE) gamma-ray emission is suppressed, and that the VHE gamma-rays are\nhadronically dominated. The energy spectrum of protons produced over the\nlife-time of the remnant until now may well reach ''knee'' energies. The\nderived gamma-ray morphology is consistent with the H.E.S.S. measurements. The\namount of energy in energetic particles corresponds to about 35% of the\nhydrodynamic explosion energy. A remaining uncertainty concerns the thermal\nX-ray flux at 1 keV. A rough estimate, possibly not quite appropriate for the\nassumed wind bubble configuration, results in it being larger than the\nnonthermal flux at this energy.\n  Conclusions.

Only the side chains are\ndifferent in the model of the Ca and Na channels. Parameters are the same for\nboth channels in all solutions. 'Pauling' radii are used for ions. No\ninformation from crystal structures is used in the model. Side chains are\ngrossly approximated as spheres. The predicted properties of the Na and Ca\nchannels are very different. How can such a simple model give such powerful\nresults when chemical intuition says that selectivity depends on the precise\nrelation of ions and side chains? We use Monte Carlo simulations of this model\nthat determine the most stable-lowest free energy-structure of the ions and\nside chains. Structure is the computed consequence of the forces in this model.\nThe relationship of ions and side chains vary with ionic solution and are very\ndifferent in simulations of the Na and Ca channels. Selectivity is a\nconsequence of the 'induced fit' of side chains to ions and depends on the\nflexibility (entropy) of the side chains as well as their location. The model\ncaptures the relation of side chains and ions well enough to account for\nselectivity of both Na channels and Ca channels in the wide range of conditions\nmeasured in experiments. Evidently, the structures in the real Na and Ca\nchannels responsible for selectivity are self-organized, at their free energy\nminimum. Oversimplified models are enough to account for selectivity if the\nmodels calculate the 'most stable' structure as it changes from solution to\nsolution, and mutation to mutation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Jun 2009 22:17:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The Cygnus OB2 association, the central engine of the Cygnus X\nstar-forming region, is the subject of an extensive INTEGRAL Key Project that\nwill accumulate 6Ms of observations. Analysis of 2Ms of observations by De\nBecker and co-workers provides the most sensitive limit yet obtained on hard\nX-ray emission from the cluster. Aims. We investigate the X-ray emission in the\n20-40 keV band expected from the flaring low-mass stellar population in Cygnus\nOB2. We discuss whether such emission needs to be considered in the\ninterpretation of existing and future X-ray observations of the region, and\nwhether such observations might provide insight into the high-energy processes\non low-mass pre-main sequence stars. Methods. The total hard X-ray flux from\nlow-mass stars is estimated by assuming the observed soft X-ray emission stems\nfrom a superposition of flares. We further assume the ratio of hard X-ray to\nsoft X-ray emission is described by a scaling found for solar flares by Isola\nand co-workers. Results. We estimate the low-mass stellar hard X-ray flux in\nthe 20-40 keV band to lie in the range ~2x10^31-6x10^32 erg/s and discuss some\npotential biases that might affect this result. Conclusions. Hard X-ray\nemission could lie at a level not much below the current observed flux upper\nlimits for Cygnus OB2. If this emission could be detected, it would provide\ninsight into the hard X-ray production of large flares on pre-main sequence\nstars. We highlight the penetrating power of hard X-rays from low-mass stellar\npopulations as a possible pointer to our Galaxy's hidden star-forming clusters\nand super-clusters using more sensitive observations from future missions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2009 08:41:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

As quantum\ngravity effects should appear at the Planck scale they will be very small and\nso require very high energy photons to travel large distances before even\nbecoming noticeable. Precisely because this effect is greater for the most\nenergetic photons (dt ~ 10 s/TeV/Gpc), ground-based gamma-ray measurements of\nlarge AGN flares are the ideal resource for performing such tests. The modest\nphoton flux combined with the fact that these experiments are capable of\nrecording the photon times with great resolution suggests the use of unbinned\nalgorithms as an optimal solution for testing models of quantum gravity.

In this paper we discuss\nseveral issues concerning bounds on concurrence measurable collectively on\ncopies of a given quantum state. Firstly, we concentrate on the recent bound on\nconcurrence by Mintert--Buchleitner [F. Mintert and A. Buchleitner, Phys. Rev.\nLett. 98, 140505 (2007)]. Relating it to the reduction criterion for\nseparability we provide yet another proof of the bound and point out some\npossibilities following from the proof which could lead to improvement of the\nbound. Then, relating concurrence to the generalized robustness of\nentanglement, we provide a method allowing for construction of lower bounds on\nconcurrence from any positive map (not only the reduction one). All these\nquantities can be measured as mean values of some two--copy observables. In\nthis sense the method generalizes the Mintert--Buchleitner bound and recovers\nit when the reduction map is used. As a particular case we investigate the\nbound obtained from the transposition map. Interestingly, comparison with MB\nbound performed on the class of 4\\otimes 4 rotationally invariant states shows\nthat the new bound is positive in regions in which the MB bound gives zero.\nFinally, we provide measurable upper bounds on the whole class of concurrences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2009 13:31:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2009 15:38:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 2009 13:45:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-25"}

We\nwish to stablish whether the chemical composition of the solar photosphere can\nbe regarded as a reference for early A- and late B-type stars. We have obtained\noptical high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio spectra of three slowly\nrotating early-type stars (HD 145788, 21 Peg and pi Cet) that show no obvious\nsign of chemical peculiarity, and performed a very accurate LTE abundance\nanalysis of up to 38 ions of 26 elements (for 21 Peg), using a vast amount of\nspectral lines visible in the spectral region covered by our spectra.

The new architecture, dubbed Green Cellular, abandons the\nclassical transceiver base station design and suggests the augmentation of\ntransceiver base stations with receive only devices.

In order to obtain a\nmore complete picture of the not yet consumed or dispersed cool gas, we\nsearched for line emission from molecular clouds that could be associated with\nmolecular hydrogen emission detected in the region. We obtained a high\nsensitivity 12CO J=2-1 map with the 15-m SEST telescope, complemented by\npointed observations of 13CO J=2-1 and CS J=2-1. We report the discovery of a\ndense molecular cloud towards an embedded young massive star at ~ 20\" (~5 pc,\nat the distance of 50 kpc) northwest of R136, the compact massive central\nstellar cluster powering 30 Doradus in the LMC, that could be triggering star\nformation in the surrounding molecular clouds. We derived a molecular mass of\n$\\lesssim 10^4$ \\msol, a linear radius of 3 pc, as an upper limit, and a mean\ndensity of $\\gtrsim 10^{3}$ cm$^{-3}$ for the cloud. The detection of CS J=2-1\nemission line indicates larger densities, $\\sim 10^{6}$ cm$^{-3}$. The dense\nmolecular cloud is associated with molecular 2.12 um H2 emission. We suggest\nthat the observed molecular gas could be the remains of dense molecular\nmaterial surviving the action of strong UV fields and winds in which the young\nmassive star has formed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2009 15:43:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

We derive the wave equations\nfor a probe pulse propagating through a chiral medium, and solve them\nanalytically in Fourier space using the slowly varying envelope approximation.\nOur analysis reveals the influence of the different medium response\ncoefficients on the propagation dynamics. Applying these results to a specific\nexample system, we show that chiral interactions already become important at\nexperimentally accessible parameter ranges in dilute vapors. The chirality\nrenders the propagation dynamics sensitive to the phase of the applied fields,\nand we show that this phase-dependence enables one to control the pulse\nevolution during its propagation through the medium. Our results demonstrate\nthat the magnetic field component of a probe beam can crucially influence the\nsystem dynamics even if it couples to the medium only weakly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2009 15:37:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-30"}

The emission-line\nproperties, and lack of x-ray emission from IC 2497, suggest either a highly\nobscured AGN with a novel geometry arranged to allow photoionization of the\nobject but not the galaxy's own circumnuclear gas, or, as we argue, the first\ndetection of a quasar light echo.
