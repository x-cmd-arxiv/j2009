In order to retrieve the system dynamics when no such a suitable\nclock field is present, we explore different constructions of families of\nunitarily related partial observables. These observables are parameterized,\nrespectively, by: (i) one of the components of the densitized triad, and (ii)\nits conjugate momentum; each of them playing the role of an evolution\nparameter. Exploiting the properties of the considered example, we investigate\nin detail the domains of applicability of each construction. In both cases the\nobservables possess a neat physical interpretation only in an approximate\nsense. However, whereas in case (i) such interpretation is reasonably accurate\nonly for a portion of the evolution of the universe, in case (ii) it remains so\nduring all the evolution (at least in the physically interesting cases). The\nconstructed families of observables are next used to describe the evolution of\nthe Bianchi I universe. The performed analysis confirms the robustness of the\nbounces, also in absence of matter fields, as well as the preservation of the\nsemiclassicality through them. The concept of evolution studied here and the\npresented construction of observables are applicable to a wide class of models\nin LQC, including quantizations of the Bianchi I model obtained with other\nprescriptions for the improved dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2009 16:03:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-05"}

Aims: We aim to compare the general relativistic (GR)\nresults by other groups with Newtonian calculations of models with equivalent\nparameters. We vary the mass ratios between NS and BH and the compactness of\nthe NS. The mass of the NS is 1.4 M_sol. We compare the dynamics in the\nparameter-space regions where the NS is expected to reach the innermost stable\ncircular orbit (ISCO) before being tidally disrupted (mass shedding, MS) and\nvice versa. Methods: The hydrodynamics is evolved by a Newtonian PPM scheme\nwith four levels of nested grids. We use a polytropic EoS (Gamma=2), as was\ndone in the GR simulations. However, instead of full GR we use a Newtonian\npotential supplemented by a Paczynski-Wiita-Artemova potential for the BH, both\ndisregarding and including rotation of the BH. Results: If the NS is compact\n(C=0.18) it is accreted by the BH more quickly, and only a small amount of mass\nremains outside the BH. If the mass ratio is small (Q=2 or 3) or the NS is less\ncompact (C=0.16 or less) the NS is tidally torn apart before being accreted.\nAlthough most of the mass is absorbed by the BH, some 0.1 M_sol remain in a\ntidal arm. For small mass ratios the tidal arm can wrap around the BH to form a\nthick disk. When including the effects of BH spin-up or spin-down by the\naccreted matter, more mass remains in the surroundings (0.2-0.3 M_sol).\nConclusions: Although details and quantitative results differ, the general\ntrends of our Newtonian calculations are similar to the GR calculations. A\nclear delimiting line that separates ISCO from the MS cases is not found.\nInclusion of BH rotation as well as sufficient numerical resolution are\nextremely important.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2009 16:29:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2010 11:01:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

The objectives of adopting this concept are to address the several\nmajor difficulties in the application of Active Contours. Primarily, a\ntechnique is developed to realize the topological changes of Parametric Active\nContours (Snakes). The key strategy is to imitate the process of a balloon\nexpanding and filling in a closed space with several objects. After removing\nthe touched balloon surfaces, the objects can be identified by surrounded\nremaining balloon surfaces. A burned region swept by Snakes is utilized to\ntrace the contour and to give a criterion for stopping the movement of Snake\ncurve. When the Snakes terminates evolution totally, through ignoring this\ncriterion, it can form a connected area by evolving the Snakes again and\ncontinuing the region burning. The contours extracted from the boundaries of\nthe burned area can represent the child snake of each object respectively.\nSecondly, a novel scheme is designed to solve the problems of leakage of the\ncontour from the large gaps, and the segmentation error in Geometric Active\nContours (GAC). It divides the segmentation procedure into two processing\nstages. By simulating the wave propagating in the isotropic substance at the\nfinal stage, it can significantly enhance the effect of image force in GAC\nbased on Level Set and give the satisfied solutions to the two problems.\nThirdly, to support the physical models for active contours above, we introduce\na general image force field created on a template plane over the image plane.\nThis force is more adaptable to noisy images with complicated geometric shapes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2009 16:38:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 Jun 2009 03:03:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2009 15:53:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-30"}

To constrain galaxy number densities,\nluminosities, and stellar populations in large structures at higher redshift,\nwe have investigated two sheet-like structures of galaxies at z=0.8 and 1.3\nspanning 150 h^-1 comoving Mpc embedded in large quasar groups extending over\nat least 200 h^-1 Mpc.

The VMR-D map covers about 1.5 square deg. of a site where star\nformation is actively ongoing. We are interested in accreting pre-main sequence\nvariables whose luminosity variations are due to intermittent events of disk\naccretion (i.e. active T Tauri stars and EXor type objects). The variable\nobjects have been selected from a catalog of more than 170,000 sources detected\nat a S/N ratio > 5. We searched the sample of variables for ones whose\nphotometric properties are close to those of known EXor's. These latter are\nmonitored in a more systematic way than T Tauri stars and the mechanisms that\nregulate the observed phenomenology are exactly the same. Hence the modalities\nof the EXor behavior is adopted as driving criterium for selecting variables in\ngeneral. We selected 19 bona fide candidates that constitute a well-defined\nsample of new variable targets for further investigation. Out of these, 10\nsources present a Spitzer MIPS 24 micron counterpart, and have been classified\nas 3 Class I, 5 flat spectrum and 2 Class II objects, while the other 9 sources\nhave spectral energy distribution compatible with phases older than Class I.\nThis is consistent with what is known about the small sample of known EXor's,\nand suggests that the accretion flaring or EXor stage might come as a Class\nI/II transition.

Moreover, the radial density profile of AGN, relative to\ngalaxy group centres is less concentrated than galaxies. This is particularly\nevident when comparing red AGN and non-active galaxies.\n  The properties of the neighbouring galaxies of blue and red AGN and non\nactive galaxies reflect this effect. While the neighbourhood of the blue\nsamples is indistinguishable, the red AGN environs show an excess of blue-star\nforming galaxies with respect to their non-active counterpart. On the other\nhand, the active and non-active blue systems have similar environments but\nmarkedly different morphological distributions, showing an excess of blue\nearly-type AGN, which are argued to be late stage mergers. This comparison\nreveals that the observable differences between active red and blue host galaxy\nproperties including star formation history and AGN activity depends on the\nenvironment within which the galaxies form and evolve.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2009 18:26:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The characteristic values of the\nbolometric luminosities and Eddington ratios, which span over 7-8 orders of\nmagnitude, from L_bol < 10^37 to 3 X 10^44 erg/s and L_bol/L_Edd ~ 10^-9 to\n10^-1, vary systematically with nuclear spectral classification, increasing\nalong the sequence absorption-line nuclei --> transition objects --> LINERs -->\nSeyferts.

Indeed,\nwe argue that the fuel reservoir generated by local processes should produce\nfar more active nuclei than is actually observed.

The HeII optical depth derived from the Lyman-alpha forest decreases\nsubstantially from this period to z ~ 2; moreover, it fluctuates strongly near\nz ~ 3 and then evolves smoothly at lower redshifts. From these opacities, we\ncompute, using a semi-analytic model, the evolution of the mean photoionization\nrate and the attenuation length for helium over the redshift range 2.0 < z <\n3.2. This model includes an inhomogeneous metagalactic radiation background,\nwhich is expected during and after helium reionization. We find that assuming a\nuniform background underestimates the required photoionization rate by up to a\nfactor ~2. When averaged over the (few) available lines of sight, the effective\noptical depth exhibits a discontinuity near z = 2.8, but the measurement\nuncertainties are sizable. This feature translates into a jump in the\nphotoionization rate and, provided the quasar emissivity evolves smoothly, in\nthe effective attenuation length, perhaps signaling the helium reionization\nera. We then compute the evolution of the effective optical depth for a variety\nof simple helium reionization models, in which the measured quasar luminosity\nfunction and the attenuation length, as well as the evolving HeIII fraction,\nare inputs. A model with reionization ending around redshift z ~ 2.7 is most\nconsistent with the data, although the constraints are not strong thanks to the\nsparseness of the data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2009 20:14:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In\nthis article, we propose to turn this limitation to our advantage and to use\nprecise strong lensing modelling to probe external mass distributions\nsurrounding the lens. We consider SL2S J08544-0121, a galaxy group at z=0.35\nthat contains a strong lensing system. A simple elliptical isothermal potential\ncannot reproduce satisfactorily the strong lensing constraints. We include an\nexternal mass perturbation corresponding to the group within which the lens is\nembedded. The lensing properties of this perturbation are parametrised by its\ntotal mass M and a smoothing scale s that quantifies the characteristic scale\nover which M is distributed. For a range of these parameters, we are able to\nreproduce accurately the observations. This suggests that light is a good\ntracer of mass. Interestingly, this also shows that a localised strong lensing\nanalysis (on scales of ~10\") allows us to constrain global properties of the\ngroup as a whole (on scales of ~100). Indeed, we constrain the group\nmass-to-light ratio to be M/L=98+-27 (i band, solar units, not corrected for\nevolution) and s=20\" +- 9 (2sigma confidence level). We demonstrate that these\nstrong lensing only constraints are due to the perturbed strong lensing\nconfiguration, where the main arc is located at ~5\" from the galaxy, whereas\nits counter-image is found at ~8\". To test independently our resulting strong\nlensing model, we pursue an independent weak lensing analysis of the group and\nfind a mass-to-light ratio in the range 66-146 (1sigma confidence level).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2009 20:16:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2010 14:57:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 10 Sep 2010 15:13:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

In this paper we construct a\nfour-valent lattice, the so called ruby lattice, governed by a 2-body\nHamiltonian. In a particular regime of coupling constants, degenerate\nperturbation theory implies that the low energy spectrum of the model can be\ndescribed by a many-body effective Hamiltonian, which encodes the color code as\nits ground state subspace. The gauge symmetry\n$\\mathbf{Z}_{2}\\times\\mathbf{Z}_{2}$ of color code could already be realized by\nidentifying three distinct plaquette operators on the lattice. Plaquettes are\nextended to closed strings or string-net structures. Non-contractible closed\nstrings winding the space commute with Hamiltonian but not always with each\nother giving rise to exact topological degeneracy of the model. Connection to\n2-colexes can be established at the non-perturbative level. The particular\nstructure of the 2-body Hamiltonian provides a fruitful interpretation in terms\nof mapping to bosons coupled to effective spins. We show that high energy\nexcitations of the model have fermionic statistics. They form three families of\nhigh energy excitations each of one color. Furthermore, we show that they\nbelong to a particular family of topological charges. Also, we use\nJordan-Wigner transformation in order to test the integrability of the model\nvia introducing of Majorana fermions. The four-valent structure of the lattice\nprevents to reduce the fermionized Hamiltonian into a quadratic form due to\ninteracting gauge fields. We also propose another construction for 2-body\nHamiltonian based on the connection between color codes and cluster states. We\ndiscuss this latter approach along the construction based on the ruby lattice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2009 20:44:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 6 Mar 2010 20:35:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Previous direct imaging has excluded the presence of any stellar or\nhigh-mass brown dwarf companion at small separations, indicating that the\nunseen companion may be a low-mass brown dwarf or high-mass planet.

We also\ndevelop an additional PSF reference subtraction scheme based on locally\noptimized combination of images (LOCI) to further enhance the detection limits.\nNo companion is seen in the images, although we are sensitive to significantly\nlower masses than previously achieved. Combining the imaging data with the\nknown radial velocity trend, we constrain the properties of the companion to\nwithin approximately 5-20 Mjup, 10-20 AU, and i > 20 deg, unless it is an\nexotic stellar remnant.

Cellular covers (sometimes called co-localizations) come up in the\ncontext of homotopical localization of topological spaces. They are related to\nidempotent cotriples, idempotent comonads or coreflectors in category theory.\n  Recall that a homomorphism of $R$-modules $\\pi: G\\to H$ is called a {\\it\ncellular cover} over $H$ if $\\pi$ induces an isomorphism $\\pi_*:\n\\Hom_R(G,G)\\cong \\Hom_R(G,H),$ where $\\pi_*(\\phi)= \\pi \\phi$ for each $\\phi \\in\n\\Hom_R(G,G)$ (where maps are acting on the left). On the one hand, we show that\nevery cotorsion-free $R$-module of rank $\\kappa<\\Cont$ is realizable as the\nkernel of some cellular cover $G\\to H$ where the rank of $G$ is $3\\kappa +1$\n(or 3, if $\\kappa=1$).

This will\nbe obtained in first place thanks to a set of four space flown instruments. A\nwide field (~2 sr) coded mask telescope (ECLAIRs), operating in the 4-250 keV\nenergy range, will provide the triggers and localizations, while a gamma-ray\nnon-imaging spectrometer (GRM), sensitive in the 50 keV-5 MeV domain, will\nextend the prompt emission energy coverage.

A set of three ground based dedicated instruments, two\nrobotic telescopes (GFTs) and a wide angle optical monitor (GWAC), will\ncomplement the space borne instruments.

The basic idea of the chase is, given a database instance\nand a set of constraints as input, to fix constraint violations in the database\ninstance. It is well-known that, for an arbitrary set of constraints, the chase\ndoes not necessarily terminate (in general, it is even undecidable if it does\nor not). Addressing this issue, we review the limitations of existing\nsufficient termination conditions for the chase and develop new techniques that\nallow us to establish weaker sufficient conditions. In particular, we introduce\ntwo novel termination conditions called safety and inductive restriction, and\nuse them to define the so-called T-hierarchy of termination conditions. We then\nstudy the interrelations of our termination conditions with previous conditions\nand the complexity of checking our conditions. This analysis leads to an\nalgorithm that checks membership in a level of the T-hierarchy and accounts for\nthe complexity of termination conditions. As another contribution, we study the\nproblem of data-dependent chase termination and present sufficient termination\nconditions w.r.t. fixed instances. They might guarantee termination although\nthe chase does not terminate in the general case. As an application of our\ntechniques beyond those already mentioned, we transfer our results into the\nfield of query answering over knowledge bases where the chase on the underlying\ndatabase may not terminate, making existing algorithms applicable to broader\nclasses of constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2009 11:46:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2009 14:38:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-17"}

This\nlast pragmatic point can be understood since the LHC specific collisions will\nprovide unprecedented kinematics for the positive and negative channels while\nthe SPS and Tevatron collider produced W+ and W- on the same footing. For that\nreason, the study of the asymmetries between W+ and W- in Drell--Yan like\nprocesses (production of single W decaying into leptons), studied to extract\nthe properties of the W boson, is described thoroughly in this document. Then,\nthe prospect for a measurement of MW+ - MW- at the LHC is addressed in a\nperspective intending to decrease as much as possible the systematic errors\nthat will inevitably comes from the misunderstanding of both phenomenological\nand apparatus modeling.

All the present data require that the fast observed\nevolution from z=0 to 1 flattens around redshift 1 and then keeps approximately\nconstant up to z~2.5 at least.

The model describes nematic liquid\ncrystalline self-assembly of rigid fibers on an arbitrarily curved fluid\nmembrane. The mechanics of the fluid membrane is described by the Helfrich\nbending-torsion model, the fiber self-assembly is described by the 2D Landau-de\nGennes quadrupolar Q-tensor order parameter model, and the fiber-membrane\ninteractions (inspired by an extension of the 2D Maier-Saupe model to curved\nsurfaces) include competing curvo-philic (curvature-seeking) and curvo-phobic\n(curvature-avoiding) effects. Analysis of the free energy reveals three fiber\norientation regimes: (a) along the major curvature, (b) along the minor\ncurvature, (c) away from the principal curvatures, according to the competing\ncurvo-philic and curvo-phobic interactions. The derived shape equation (normal\nstress balance) now includes curvature-nematic ordering contributions, with\nboth bending and torsion renormalizations. Integration of the shape and nematic\norder equations gives a complete model whose solution describes the coupled\nmembrane shape/fiber order state.

This phenomenon is experimentally testable and\nhas an intriguing implication for biological organization and evolution, as it\namounts to \"optimization without natural selection of replicators\". Unlike the\nstatistical-mechanical approaches to self-organization, the Cf principle does\nnot encounter the problem of \"tradeoff between stability and complexity\" at the\nlevel of individual cell. Physically, the Cf is considered as a harmonic-like\nforce of reaction, which keeps the state of the cell close to the ground state,\ndefined here as a state where enzymatic acts work most efficiently. Ground\nstate is subject to unitary evolution, and serves as a starting point in a\ngeneral strategy of quantum description of intracellular processes, termed here\n\"Euclidean approach\".

Linear coupling to\nthe environment is assumed, but the Hamiltonian can be a general function of\npositions and momenta. The theory is carried out in the chord representation\nand describes the evolved quantum characteristic function, which gives direct\naccess to the Wigner function and the position representation of the density\noperator by Fourier transforms. The propagation is shown to be of Liouville\ntype in a complex double phase space, the imaginary part of the action being\nresponsible for decoherence. The theory is exact in the quadratic case, just as\nthe real WKB theory that we previously developed for the Markovian evolution of\nextended states, but it also describes the decoherent and dissipative evolution\nof localized states, such as the interference terms of a Schr\\\"odinger cat\nstate. The present rederivation of the real WKB approximation leads to its\ninterpretation as a first order classical perturbation of the complex theory\nand to a discussion of its validity. The example of a simple cubic Hamiltonian\nillustrates the various levels of approximation derived from the complex WKB\ntheory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2009 15:44:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The results are examined in the light of a recently\nderived linear mapping between the temperature-dependent conductance and the\nuniversal function describing the conductance for the symmetric Anderson model.\nA gate potential applied to the conduction electrons is known to change\nmarkedly the transport properties of a quantum dot side-coupled to the\nconduction path; in the embedded geometry here discussed, a similar potential\nis shown to affect only quantitatively the temperature dependence of the\nconductance. As expected, in the Kondo regime the numerical results are in\nexcellent agreement with the mapped conductances. In the mixed-valence regime,\nthe mapping describes accurately the low-temperature tail of the conductance.\nThe mapping is shown to provide a unified view of conduction in the\nsingle-electron transistor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2009 15:46:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-13"}

We prove that A_f has bounded-error\ncommunication complexity Omega(d), where d is the approximate degree of f. This\nresult remains valid in the quantum model, regardless of prior entanglement. In\nparticular, it gives a new and simple proof of Razborov's breakthrough quantum\nlower bounds for disjointness and other symmetric predicates. We further\ncharacterize the discrepancy, approximate rank, and approximate trace norm of\nA_f in terms of well-studied analytic properties of f, broadly generalizing\nseveral recent results on small-bias communication and agnostic learning. The\nmethod of this paper has recently enabled important progress in multiparty\ncommunication complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2009 15:51:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-24"}
