Our N-body code integrates the\ngeodesic deviation equation in order to track the streams and caustics\nassociated with individual simulation particles. The radial orbit instability\ncauses our haloes to develop major-to-minor axis ratios approaching 10 to 1 in\ntheir inner regions. They grow similarly in time and have similar density\nprofiles to the spherical similarity solution, but their detailed structure is\nvery different. The higher dimensionality of the orbits causes their stream and\ncaustic densities to drop much more rapidly than in the similarity solution.\nThis results in a corresponding increase in the number of streams at each\npoint. At 1% of the turnaround radius (corresponding roughly to the Sun's\nposition in the Milky Way) we find of order 10^6 streams in our simulations, as\ncompared to 10^2 in the similarity solution. The number of caustics in the\ninner halo increases by a factor of several, because a typical orbit has six\nturning points rather than one, but caustic densities drop by a much larger\nfactor. This reduces the caustic contribution to the annihilation radiation.\nFor the region between 1% and 50% of the turnaround radius, this is 4% of the\ntotal in our simulated haloes, as compared to 6.5% in the similarity solution.\nCaustics contribute much less at smaller radii. These numbers assume a 100 GeV\nc^-2 neutralino with present-day velocity dispersion 0.03 cm s^-1, but reducing\nthe dispersion by ten orders of magnitude only doubles the caustic luminosity.\nWe conclude that caustics will be unobservable in the inner parts of haloes.\nOnly the outermost caustic might potentially be detectable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jun 2009 16:28:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Sep 2009 09:41:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

If $I$ is coercive, then given a large simulated mean\nposition, under general conditions our results imply that the most likely\nasymptotic behavior, $\\psi^*$, of the paths $n^{-1} W_{\\lfloor tn\\rfloor}$ is\nto be zero apart from on an interval $[T_0,T_1]\\subset[0,1]$ and to satisfy the\nfunctional equation \\begin{align*} \\nabla\nI\\left(\\ddt\\psi^*(t)\\right)=\\lambda^*(T_1-t) \\quad \\text{whenever } \\psi(t)\\neq\n0. \\end{align*} If $I$ is non-coercive, a similar, but slightly more involved,\nresult holds.\n  These results prove, in broad generality, that Monte Carlo estimates of the\nsteady-state mean position of a RRW have a high likelihood of over-estimation.\nThis has serious implications for the performance evaluation of queueing\nsystems by simulation techniques where steady state expected queue-length and\nwaiting time are key performance metrics. The results show that na\\\"ive\nestimates of these quantities from simulation are highly likely to be\nconservative.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jun 2009 16:27:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2010 10:40:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 25 Jun 2010 12:35:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-01"}

A magnetic polarity reversal was observed relative to the\nmagnetic topology in June 2007. This is the second such reversal observed in\ntwo years on this star, suggesting that Tau Boo has a magnetic cycle of about 2\nyears. This is the first detection of a magnetic cycle for a star other than\nthe Sun. The role of the close-in massive planet in the short activity cycle of\nthe star is questioned.\n  Tau Boo has strong differential rotation, a common trend for stars with\nshallow convective envelope. At latitude 40 deg., the surface layer of the star\nrotates in 3.31 d, equal to the orbital period. Synchronization suggests that\nthe tidal effects induced by the planet may be strong enough to force at least\nthe thin convective envelope into corotation. Tau Boo shows variability in the\nCa H & K and Halpha throughout the night and on a night to night time scale.

With a\nsecond coupled exciton in the system, we find that the magnitude and the\nlifetime of these oscillations greatly increases, since the cavity is then able\nto exchange photons with multiple excitonic resonances.

Fluctuations of the NIRB can provide information on the first\nstructures, such as halos and their surrounding ionized regions in the IGM. We\ncombine, for the first time, N-body simulations, radiative transfer code, and\nanalytic calculations of luminosity of early structures to predict the angular\npower spectrum (C_l) of fluctuations in the NIRB. We study the effects of\nvarious assumptions about the stellar mass, the initial mass spectrum of stars,\nmetallicity, the star formation efficiency (f_*), the escape fraction of\nionizing photons (f_esc), and the star formation timescale (t_SF), on the\namplitude as well as the shape of C_l. The power spectrum of NIRB fluctuations\nis maximized when f_* is the largest (as C_l ~ (f_*)^2) and f_esc is the\nsmallest. A significant uncertainty in the predicted amplitude of C_l exists\ndue to our lack of knowledge of t_SF of these galaxies, which is equivalent to\nour lack of knowledge of the mass-to-light ratio. We do not see a turnover in\nthe NIRB angular power spectrum of the halo contribution and explain this as\nthe effect of high levels of non-linear bias. This is partly due to our choice\nof the minimum mass of halos contributing to NIRB, and a smaller minimum mass,\nwhich has a smaller non-linear bias, may still exhibit a turn over. Therefore,\nboth the amplitude and shape of the NIRB power spectrum provide important\ninformation regarding the nature of sources contributing to the cosmic\nreionization. The angular power spectrum of the IGM, in most cases, is much\nsmaller than the halo angular power spectrum. In addition, low levels of the\nobserved mean background intensity tend to rule out high values of f_* > 0.2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jun 2009 23:00:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2010 18:56:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-01"}

This confirms that a stationary shock is an integral part of such an\naccretion disc in the Kerr metric. The equations describing the space gradient\nof the dynamical flow velocity of the accreting matter have been shown to be\nequivalent to a first order autonomous dynamical systems. Fixed point analysis\nensures that such flow must be multi-transonic for certain astrophysically\nrelevant initial boundary conditions. Contrary to the existing consensus in the\nliterature, the critical points and the sonic points are proved not to be\nisomorphic in general. Homoclinic orbits for the flow flow possessing multiple\ncritical points select the critical point with the higher entropy accretion\nrate, confirming that the entropy accretion rate is the degeneracy removing\nagent in the system. However, heteroclinic orbits are also observed for some\nspecial situation, where both the saddle type critical points of the flow\nconfiguration possesses identical entropy accretion rate. Topologies with\nheteroclinic orbits are thus the only allowed non removable degenerate\nsolutions for accretion flow with multiple critical points, and are shown to be\nstructurally unstable. Depending on suitable initial boundary conditions, a\nhomoclinic trajectory can be combined with a standard non homoclinic orbit\nthrough an energy preserving Rankine-Hugoniot type of stationary shock.

Four of the PNe are located in the Small Magellanic\nCloud (SMC) and 11 are located in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Based on\nGalactic PNe the expected radio flux densities at the distance of the LMC/SMC\nare up to ~2.5 mJy and ~2.0 mJy at 1.4 GHz, respectively. We find that one of\nour new radio PNe in the SMC has a flux density of 5.1 mJy at 1.4 GHz, several\ntimes higher than expected.

An opportunistic scheduling rule in\nthis context selects a user (or users) to serve based on the current channel\nstate and user queues. Unless the user traffic is symmetric and/or the\nunderlying capacity region a polymatroid, little is known concerning how\nperformance optimal schedulers should tradeoff \"maximizing current service\nrate\" (being opportunistic) versus \"balancing unequal queues\" (enhancing\nuser-diversity to enable future high service rate opportunities). By contrast\nwith currently proposed opportunistic schedulers, e.g., MaxWeight and Exp Rule,\na radial sum-rate monotone (RSM) scheduler de-emphasizes queue-balancing in\nfavor of greedily maximizing the system service rate as the queue-lengths are\nscaled up linearly. In this paper it is shown that an RSM opportunistic\nscheduler, p-Log Rule, is not only throughput-optimal, but also maximizes the\nasymptotic exponential decay rate of the sum-queue distribution for a two-queue\nsystem. The result complements existing optimality results for opportunistic\nscheduling and point to RSM schedulers as a good design choice given the need\nfor robustness in wireless systems with both heterogeneity and high degree of\nuncertainty.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 2009 03:29:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 2010 21:17:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

We diagnose the properties of the plume and interplume regions in a\npolar coronal hole and the role of waves in the acceleration of the solar wind.\nAims. We attempt to detect whether Alfven waves are present in the polar\ncoronal holes through variations in EUV line widths. Methods. Using spectral\nobservations performed over a polar coronal hole region with the EIS\nspectrometer on Hinode, we study the variation in the line width and electron\ndensity as a function of height. We use the density sensitive line pairs of Fe\nxii 186.88 A & 195.119 A and Fe xiii 203.82 A & 202.04 A . Results. For the\npolar region, the line width data show that the nonthermal line-of-sight\nvelocity increases from 26 km/s at 1000 above the limb to 42 km/s some 15000\n(i.e. 110,000 km) above the limb.

The cusp-core discrepancy is one of the major problems in\nastrophysics. It results from comparing the observed mass distribution of\ngalaxies with the predictions of Cold Dark Matter simulations.

We want to determine the shape of the dark matter potential in the\nnuclear regions of a sample of six nearby irregular dwarf galaxies.\n  Methods. In order to quantify the amount of non-circular motions which could\npotentially affect a mass decomposition, we first perform a harmonic\ndecomposition of the HI Hermite velocity fields of all sample galaxies. We then\ndecompose the HI rotation curves into different mass components by fitting NFW\nand pseudo-isothermal halo models to the HI rotation curves using a chi^2\nminimisation. We model the minimum-disc, the minimum-disc+gas, and the\nmaximum-disc cases.\n  Results. The non-circular motions are in all cases studied here of the order\nof only a few km/s (generally corresponding to less than 25% of the local\nrotation velocity), which means that they do not significantly affect the\nrotation curves. The observed rotation curves can better be described by the\ncored pseudo-isothermal halo than by the NFW halo. The slopes of the dark\nmatter density profiles confirm this result and are in good agreement with\nprevious studies.

The approximately equal hierarchies between successive generations,\nthe sizes of the mixing angles, the heaviness of just the top quark, and the\napproximate down-lepton equality can all be accommodated by many flavor models\nbut can appear ad hoc. We present a simple, predictive mechanism to explain\nthese patterns. All generations are treated democratically and the flavor\nsymmetries are broken collectively by only two allowed couplings in\nflavor-space, a vector and matrix, with arbitrary O(1) entries. Repeated use of\nthese flavor symmetry breaking spurions radiatively generates the Yukawa\ncouplings with a natural hierarchy. We demonstrate this idea with two models in\na split supersymmetric grand unified framework, with minimal additional\nparticle content at the unification scale. Although flavor is generated at the\nGUT scale, there are several potentially testable predictions. In our minimal\nmodel the usual prediction of exact b-tau unification is replaced by the SU(5)\nbreaking relation m_tau / m_b = 3 / 2, in better agreement with observations.\nOther SU(5) breaking effects in the fermion masses can easily arise directly\nfrom the flavor model itself. The symmetry breaking that triggers the\ngeneration of flavor necessarily gives rise to an axion, solving the strong CP\nproblem. These theories contain long-lived particles whose decays could give\nstriking signatures at the LHC and may solve the primordial Lithium problems.\nThese models also give novel proton decay signatures which can be probed by the\nnext generation of experiments. Measurement of the various proton decay\nchannels directly probes the flavor symmetry breaking couplings. In this\nscenario the Higgs mass is predicted to lie in a range near 150 GeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 2009 10:31:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2010 18:06:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

The regions for which the relic abundance of the LSP is\nconsistent with WMAP and collider constraints are identified, showing that the\nbulk region and other previously excluded regions are now permitted. Requiring\nvacuum stability limits the allowed regions.

One of their modelling uncertainties is the\ninfluence of convective flows on their shape. We aim to characterize the\ninfluence of convection on the wings of Balmer lines. We perform a differential\ncomparison of synthetic Balmer line profiles obtained from 3D hydrodynamical\nmodel atmospheres and 1D hydrostatic standard ones. The model parameters are\nappropriate for F,G,K dwarf and subgiant stars of metallicity ranging from\nsolar to 1/1000 solar. The shape of the Balmer lines predicted by 3D models can\nnever be exactly reproduced by a 1D model, irrespective of its effective\ntemperature. We introduce the concept of a 3D temperature correction, as the\neffective temperature difference between a 3D model and a 1D model which\nprovides the closest match to the 3D profile. The temperature correction is\ndifferent for the different members of the Balmer series and depends on the\nadopted mixing-length parameter in the 1D model. Among the investigated models,\nthe 3D correction ranges from -300K to +300K. Horizontal temperature\nfluctuations tend to reduce the 3D correction. Accurate effective temperatures\ncannot be derived from the wings of Balmer lines, unless the effects of\nconvection are properly accounted for. The 3D models offer a physically well\njustified way of doing so. The use of 1D models treating convection with the\nmixing-length theory do not appear to be suitable for this purpose. In\nparticular, there are indications that it is not possible to determine a single\nvalue of the mixing-length parameter which will optimally reproduce the Balmer\nlines for any choice of atmospheric parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 2009 14:12:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

While we now have an idea for\nhow the merger fraction evolves at redshifts z < 3, converting this merger\nfraction into merger rates, and therefore how many mergers an average galaxy\nundergoes during its history, is still uncertain. The main reason for this is\nthat the inferred number of mergers depends highly upon the time-scale\nobservational methods are sensitive for finding ongoing or past mergers. While\nthere are several theoretical and model-based estimates of merger times, there\nis currently no empirical measure of this time-scale. We present the first\nobservationally based measurement of merger times utilising the observed\ndecline in the galaxy major merger fraction at z < 1.2 based on > 20,000\ngalaxies in the Extended Groth Strip and COSMOS surveys. Using a new\nmethodology described in this paper, we determine how long a galaxy remains\nidentifiable as a merging system within the CAS system. We find a maximum CAS\nmajor merger time-scale of 1.1+/-0.3 Gyr at z < 1.2, and a most likely CAS\nmerger time-scale of 0.6+/-0.3 Gyr, in good agreement with results from N-body\nsimulations. Utilizing this time-scale we measure the number of major mergers\ngalaxies with masses M_{*} > 10^{10} M_0 undergo at z < 1.2, with a total\nnumber N_m = 0.90_{-0.23}^{+0.44}. We further show that this time-scale is\ninconsistent with a star formation origin for ultra-high asymmetries, thereby\nproviding further evidence that structural methods are able to locate mostly\nmerging galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 2009 14:35:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Both\nstars were selected from a larger sample of evolved disc sources observed with\nSpitzer and show unique solid-state and gas features in their infrared spectra.\nMoreover, they show a very small infrared excess in comparison with the other\nsample stars. Methods: The different dust and gas species are identified on the\nbasis of high-resolution Spitzer-IRS spectra. We fit the full spectrum to\nconstrain grain sizes and temperature distributions in the discs. This,\ncombined with our broad-band spectral energy distribution and interferometric\nmeasurements, allows us to study the physical structure of the disc, using a\nself-consistent 2D radiative-transfer disc model. Results: We find that both\nstars have strong emission features due to CO_2 gas, dominated by\n^{12}C^{16}O_2, but with clear ^{13}C^{16}O_2 and even ^{16}O^{12}C^{18}O\nisotopic signatures. Crystalline silicates are apparent in both sources but\nproved very hard to model. EP Lyr also shows evidence of mixed chemistry, with\nemission features of the rare class-C PAHs. Whether these PAHs reside in the\noxygen-rich disc or in a carbon-rich outflow is still unclear. With the\nstrongly processed silicates, the mixed chemistry and the low ^{12}C/^{13}C\nratio, EP Lyr resembles some silicate J-type stars, although the depleted\nphotosphere makes nucleosynthetic signatures difficult to probe. We find that\nthe disc environment of both sources is, to a first approximation, well\nmodelled with a passive disc, but additional physics such as grain settling,\nradial dust distributions, and an outflow component must be included to explain\nthe details of the observed spectral energy distributions in both stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 2009 15:41:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}
