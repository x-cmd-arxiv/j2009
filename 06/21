A\nnumber of these offer mechanisms for other users to evaluate these opinions; a\ncanonical example is Amazon.com, where reviews come with annotations like \"26\nof 32 people found the following review helpful.\" Opinion evaluation appears in\nmany off-line settings as well, including market research and political\ncampaigns. Reasoning about the evaluation of an opinion is fundamentally\ndifferent from reasoning about the opinion itself: rather than asking, \"What\ndid Y think of X?\", we are asking, \"What did Z think of Y's opinion of X?\" Here\nwe develop a framework for analyzing and modeling opinion evaluation, using a\nlarge-scale collection of Amazon book reviews as a dataset. We find that the\nperceived helpfulness of a review depends not just on its content but also but\nalso in subtle ways on how the expressed evaluation relates to other\nevaluations of the same product. As part of our approach, we develop novel\nmethods that take advantage of the phenomenon of review \"plagiarism\" to control\nfor the effects of text in opinion evaluation, and we provide a simple and\nnatural mathematical model consistent with our findings. Our analysis also\nallows us to distinguish among the predictions of competing theories from\nsociology and social psychology, and to discover unexpected differences in the\ncollective opinion-evaluation behavior of user populations from different\ncountries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Jun 2009 01:59:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-24"}

It is based on the well-founded semantics of normal logic\nprograms and inspired by ideas of Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) and\nconstructive negation for logic programs. Hybrid rules are normal clauses\nextended with constraints in the bodies; constraints are certain formulae in\nthe language of the external theory. A hybrid program is a pair of a set of\nhybrid rules and an external theory. Instances of the framework are obtained by\nspecifying the class of external theories, and the class of constraints. An\nexample instance is integration of (non-disjunctive) Datalog with ontologies\nformalized as description logics.\n  The paper defines a declarative semantics of hybrid programs and a\ngoal-driven formal operational semantics. The latter can be seen as a\ngeneralization of SLS-resolution. It provides a basis for hybrid\nimplementations combining Prolog with constraint solvers. Soundness of the\noperational semantics is proven. Sufficient conditions for decidability of the\ndeclarative semantics, and for completeness of the operational semantics are\ngiven.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Jun 2009 16:09:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-08"}

The sharp decrease in the anisotropy below a certain\ntemperature (T$_M$) indicates dimensional crossover. Superconductivity occurs\nat 1.8 K well below $T_M$. Negative MRs are observed with magnetic field (H)\napplied along b axis. This could be ascribed to suppression of energy gap\nassociated with CDW state. While large positive MR is observed with H\n$\\parallel$ c-axis. The MR data can be well fitted by a modified two-band model\nwhich has been used in CDW compounds such as quasi-two-dimensional purple\nbronzes A$_{0.9}$Mo$_6$O$_{17}$ (A = K, Na, Tl) and quasi-one-dimensional\nconductor NbSe$_3$. The behavior of MR provides a strong evidence for the\nexistence of CDW instability in $Li_{0.9}Mo_6O_{17}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Jun 2009 09:07:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

In contrast to the\noutput-erasure channel where erasures are applied to the output of a linear\ntime-invariant (LTI) system, here erasures, known to the receiver, are applied\nto the inputs of the LTI system. Focusing on the case where the input symbols\nare independent and identically distributed (i.i.d)., it is shown that the two\nchannels (input- and output-erasure) are equivalent. Furthermore, assuming that\nthe LTI system consists of a two-tap finite impulse response (FIR) filter, and\nusing simple properties of tri-diagonal matrices, an achievable rate expression\nis presented in the form of an infinite sum. The results are then used to study\nthe benefits of joint multicell processing (MCP) over single-cell processing\n(SCP) in a simple linear cellular uplink, where each mobile terminal is\nreceived by only the two nearby base-stations (BSs). Specifically, the analysis\naccounts for ergodic shadowing that simultaneously blocks the mobile terminal\n(MT) signal from being received by the two BS. It is shown that the resulting\nergodic per-cell capacity with optimal MCP is equivalent to that of the two-tap\ninput-erasure channel. Finally, the same cellular uplink is addressed by\naccounting for dynamic user activity, which is modelled by assuming that each\nMT is randomly selected to be active or to remain silent throughout the whole\ntransmission block.

As a corollary, we prove that the number of\nperfect matchings of a connected cubic line graph with $n$ vertices equals\n$2^{n/6+1}$ if $n>4$, which implies the conjecture by Lov\\'asz and Plummer\nholds for the connected cubic line graphs. As applications, we enumerate\nperfect matchings of the Kagom\\'e lattices, $3.12.12$ lattices, and Sierpinski\ngasket with dimension two in the context of statistical physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Jun 2009 14:24:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

Y. Lu et al. (2007, Nature {3} {91}), is investigated for quantum\ncommunication protocols like teleportation, quantum information splitting\n(QIS), remote state preparation and dense coding. We show that the present\nstate can be used for the teleportation of an arbitrary two qubit state\ndeterministically. Later we devise two distinct protocols for the QIS of an\narbitrary two qubit state among two parties and systematically compare their\nrelative merits in terms of classical communication and security. Sixteen\northogonal measurement basis on the cluster state is constructed, which will\nlock an arbitrary two qubit state among two parties. The usefulness of the\nstate for dense coding is investigated and it is shown that one can send five\nclassical bits by sending only three qubits using this state as a shared\nentangled resource. We finally show that this state can also be utilised in the\nremote state preparation of an arbitrary two qubit state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Jun 2009 15:07:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}
