The variability suggests that the\nnucleus is seen directly, however the absence of broad lines contradicts the\nsimple formulation of Unified Models for AGN. We present the results of\nquasi-simultaneous spectroscopic observations with XMM-Newton and NTT (La\nSilla) of two \"naked\" AGN. We confirm the \"naked\" nature of Q2131-427 for which\nno broad emission line components have been detected in the optical spectrum\nand its X-ray spectrum shows no signs of intrinsic absorption. The optical and\nX-ray mismatch in this source cannot be ascribed to a high nuclear dust-to-gas\nratio and a Compton Thick nature is ruled out on the basis of the high\nF(X)/F([OIII]) ratio. The Broad Line Region (BLR) may be completely absent in\nthis source, possibly as a consequence of its low Eddington ratio.

A type Ia SN is thought to arise from the thermonuclear detonation\nof a white dwarf star composed mainly of carbon and oxygen, whose mass\napproaches the Chandrasekhar limit.

Spectroscopic observations and the derived\nnucleosynthetic output show that the SN ejecta have high velocities and are\ndominated by helium-burning products, indicating that SN 2005E was neither a\nsubluminous nor a regular SN Ia (Fig. 2). We have therefore found a new type of\nstellar explosion, arising from a low-mass, old stellar system, likely\ninvolving a binary with a primary white dwarf and a helium-rich secondary.

These effects occur at the\nsecond matching field where there are two vortices per pinning site, and arise\ndue to the formation of vortex dimer states in the interstitial regions of the\nhoneycomb array. The orientation of the pinned and moving vortex dimers can be\ncontrolled externally by the application of a drive. We term this a\npolarization effect and demonstrate that it can lock or unlock the vortex\nmotion into different symmetry directions of the underlying pinning lattice. If\nthe moving vortices are locked into one direction, the motion can be switched\ninto a different direction by applying an additional bias drive, producing\nsharp jumps in the transverse and longitudinal velocities. Further, the dc\nvortex motion in one direction can be controlled directly by application of a\nforce in the perpendicular direction.

Every image of a flaring observation was examined by eye and with a\nPSF-matching and image subtraction tool to guard against false positives.\nFlaring is found to be strongly correlated with the appearance of H-alpha in\nemission in the quiet spectrum. Of the 99 flare stars that have spectra, we\nclassify 8 as relatively inactive. The flaring fraction is found to increase\nstrongly in stars with redder colors during quiescence, which can be attributed\nto the increasing flare visibility and increasing active fraction for redder\nstars. The flaring fraction is strongly correlated with |Z| distance such that\nmost stars that flare are within 300 pc of the Galactic plane. We derive flare\nu-band luminosities and find that the most luminous flares occur on the\nearlier-type M dwarfs. Our best estimate of the lower limit on the flaring rate\n(averaged over Stripe 82) for flares with \\Delta u \\ge 0.7 magnitudes on stars\nwith u < 22 is 1.3 flares hour^-1 square degree^-1 but can vary significantly\nwith the line-of-sight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2009 01:14:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-28"}

It is a\nparticularly popular approach in genomic and proteomic sequence analysis.\nNumerous mappings of symbolic sequences have been proposed for various\napplications. It is unclear however whether the processing of symbolic data\nprovides an artifact of the numerical mapping or is an inherent property of the\nsymbolic data. This issue has been long ignored in the engineering and\nscientific literature. It is possible that many of the results obtained in\nsymbolic signal processing could be a byproduct of the mapping and might not\nshed any light on the underlying properties embedded in the data. Moreover, in\nmany applications, conflicting conclusions may arise due to the choice of the\nmapping used for numerical representation of symbolic data. In this paper, we\npresent a novel framework for the analysis of the equivalence of the mappings\nused for numerical representation of symbolic data. We present strong and weak\nequivalence properties and rely on signal correlation to characterize\nequivalent mappings. We derive theoretical results which establish conditions\nfor consistency among numerical mappings of symbolic data. Furthermore, we\nintroduce an abstract mapping model for symbolic sequences and extend the\nnotion of equivalence to an algebraic framework. Finally, we illustrate our\ntheoretical results by application to DNA sequence analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2009 01:10:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The numerical method uses coarse grained microscopic expressions\nfor the strain, displacement and stress fields. This method allows us to\ncalculate the local elasticity tensor and to quantify the deviation from linear\nelasticity (local Hooke's law) at different coarse-graining scales. From the\nresults a clear picture emerges of an amorphous material with strongly\nspatially heterogeneous elastic moduli that simultaneously satisfies Hooke's\nlaw at scales larger than a characteristic length scale of the order of five\ninteratomic distances. At this scale the glass appears as a composite material\ncomposed of a rigid scaffoldingand of soft zones. Only recently calculated in\nnon homogeneous materials, the local elastic structure plays a crucial role in\nthe elasto-plastic response of the amorphous material. For a small macroscopic\nshear strain the structures associated with the non-affine displacement field\nappear directly related to the spatial structure of the elastic moduli.\nMoreover for a larger macroscopic shear strain we show that zones of low shear\nmodulus concentrate most of the strain in form of plastic rearrangements.

Such density\ngradients are a source of free energy for the excitation of drift waves. We use\nonly well established basic theory, verified experimentally in laboratory\nplasmas. Two mechanisms of the energy exchange and heating are shown to take\nplace simultaneously: one due to the Landau effect in the direction parallel to\nthe magnetic field, and another one, stochastic heating, in the perpendicular\ndirection. The stochastic heating i) is due to the electrostatic nature of the\nwaves, ii) is more effective on ions than on electrons, iii) acts predominantly\nin the perpendicular direction, iv) heats heavy ions more efficiently than\nlighter ions, and v) may easily provide a drift wave heating rate that is\norders of magnitude above the value that is presently believed to be sufficient\nfor the coronal heating, i.e., $\\simeq 6 \\cdot 10^{-5} $J/(m$^3$s) for active\nregions and $\\simeq 8 \\cdot 10^{-6} $J/(m$^3$s) for coronal holes.

This approach is based on the time-propagation of\nthe Kadanoff-Baym equations for the nonequilibrium many-body Green's function\nof open and interacting systems out of equilibrium. An important feature of the\nmethod is that it takes full account of electronic correlations and embedding\neffects in the presence of time-dependent external fields, while at the same\ntime satisfying the charge conservation law. The method further extends the\nMeir-Wingreen formula to the time domain for initially correlated states. We\nstudy the electron dynamics of a correlated quantum wire attached to\ntwo-dimensional leads exposed to a sudden switch-on of a bias voltage using\nconserving many-body approximations at Hartree-Fock, second Born and GW level.\nWe obtain detailed results for the transient currents, dipole moments, spectral\nfunctions, charging times, and the many-body screening of the quantum wire as\nwell as for the time-dependent density pattern in the leads, and we show how\nthe time-dependence of these observables provides a wealth of information on\nthe level structure of the quantum wire out of equilibrium. For moderate\ninteraction strenghts the 2B and GW results are in excellent agreement at all\ntimes. We find that many-body effects beyond the Hartree-Fock approximation\nhave a large effect on the qualitative behavior of the system and lead to a\nbias dependent gap closing and quasiparticle broadening, shortening of the\ntransient times and washing out of the step features in the current-voltage\ncurves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2009 15:24:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-28"}
