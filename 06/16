This chemotactic ability relies on the remarkable\ncapacity of cells to infer gradients from particles randomly arriving at\ncell-surface receptors by diffusion. Whereas the physical limits of\nconcentration sensing by cells have been explored, there is no theory for the\nphysical limits of gradient sensing. Here, we derive such a theory, using as\nmodels a perfectly absorbing sphere and a perfectly monitoring sphere, which,\nrespectively, infer gradients from the absorbed surface particle density or the\npositions of freely diffusing particles inside a spherical volume. We find that\nthe perfectly absorbing sphere is superior to the perfectly monitoring sphere,\nboth for concentration and gradient sensing, since previously observed\nparticles are never remeasured. The superiority of the absorbing sphere helps\nexplain the presence at the surfaces of cells of signal degrading enzymes, such\nas PDE for cAMP in Dictyostelium discoideum (Dicty) and BAR1 for mating factor\nalpha in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (budding yeast). Quantitatively, our theory\ncompares favorably to recent measurements of Dicty moving up a cAMP gradient,\nsuggesting these cells operate near the physical limits of gradient detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2009 16:13:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Although these disks seem to be ejected from the\nstar and not accreted, there is substantial observational evidence to show that\nthe stars rotate more slowly than required for centrifugally driven mass loss.\nThis paper develops an idea (proposed originally by Hiroyasu Ando and\ncolleagues) that nonradial stellar pulsations inject enough angular momentum\ninto the upper atmosphere to spin up a Keplerian disk. The pulsations\nthemselves are evanescent in the stellar photosphere, but they may be unstable\nto the generation of resonant oscillations at the acoustic cutoff frequency. A\ndetailed theory of the conversion from pulsations to resonant waves does not\nyet exist for realistic hot-star atmospheres, so the current models depend on a\nparameterized approximation for the efficiency of wave excitation. Once\nresonant waves have been formed, however, they grow in amplitude with\nincreasing height, steepen into shocks, and exert radial and azimuthal Reynolds\nstresses on the mean fluid. Using reasonable assumptions for the stellar\nparameters, these processes were found to naturally create the inner boundary\nconditions required for dense Keplerian disks, even when the underlying B-star\nphotosphere is rotating as slowly as 60% of its critical rotation speed.\nBecause there is evidence for long-term changes in Be-star pulsational\nproperties, this model may also account for the long-term variability of Be\nstars, including transitions between normal, Be, and shell phases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2009 19:39:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-02"}

Again a repeatable correlation is seen between two\nindependent subsets of the data. In this case, though, the cross-correlation\nfunction has an unusual structure comprising a dip followed by a double-peak.\nWe suggest that this may be equivalent to the dip plus single peak structure\nseen by Kanbach et al.

A key test\nof these results is a determination of the stellar kinematics of one of the\ncompact galaxies: if the sizes of these objects are as extreme as has been\nclaimed, their stars are expected to have much higher velocities than those in\npresent-day galaxies of the same mass. Here we report a measurement of the\nstellar velocity dispersion of a massive compact galaxy at redshift z=2.186,\ncorresponding to a look-back time of 10.7 billion years.

Optical imaging in 2009 May identifies B1827+0617 at\nR ~ 16.9, and shows that it is at least 2 magnitudes brighter than on the\nPalomar Sky Survey plates. Contemporaneous optical spectroscopy acquired during\nthis high state finds a weak emission line that we attribute to Mg II at\nredshift z = 0.75, supporting a flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ)\nclassification. The variability characteristics and radio properties together\nindicate that 0FGL J1830.3+0617 at Galactic latitude b = 7.5 degrees is a\nblazar. Blazar identifications of three additional low-latitude Fermi sources,\n0FGL J0643.2+0858, 0FGL J1326.6-5302, and 0FGL J1328.8-5604, are also\nsuggested.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2009 07:43:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2009 13:22:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2009 07:40:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-12"}

Evidence is\npresented for sharp density variations in the nebula which are interpreted as a\nclearing of material nearest the central source. High excitation lines of FeIII\nand SeIV show that the ionization of the nebula clearly changes with distance\nfrom the central source. A double lobed kinematic signature (+/- 25 kms) is\nevident in the Br gamma line map which may be related to the larger scale\nionized flow detailed in earlier investigations.

However, compared to previous surveys we probe deeper into the\nlow CO luminosity end of ULIRG population as a single study by including a\nnumber of CO faint objects in the sample. As a result, we find 1) a smoother\ntransition between the ULIRG population and local QSOs in L_FIR-L'_CO (\"star\nformation efficiency\") space, and 2) a broader range of L_FIR/L'_CO flux ratio\n(~60--1000 L_sun/[K km/s/pc^2]) than previously reported.

The knots are found at distances of 2.2'-6.4'\nfrom the central star (CS). At the inner edge and in the inner ring (up to 4.5'\nfromthe CS), the knot often show a `tadpole' shape, an elliptical head with a\nbright crescent inside and a long tail opposite to the CS. In detail, there are\nvariations in the tadpole shapes, such as narrowing tails, widening tails,\nmeandering tails, or multi-peaks within a tail. In the outer ring (4.5'-6.4'\nfrom the CS), the shapes are more fractured, and the tails do not collimate\ninto a single direction. The transition in knot morphology from the inner edge\nto the outer ring is clearly seen. The number density of knots governs the H2\nsurface brightness in the inner ring: H2 exists only within the knots. Possible\nmechanisms which contribute to the shaping of the knots are discussed,\nincluding photo-ionization and streaming motions. A plausible interpretation of\nour images is that inner knots are being overrun by a faster wind, but that\nthis has not (yet) reached the outer knots.

To constrain the nature of such\ndepletion, we conduct a homogeneous analysis of a very large sample of stars in\nthe metal-poor globular cluster NGC6397, covering well all evolutionary phases\nfrom below the main sequence turn-off to high up the red giant branch. Non-LTE\nLi abundances or abundance upper limits are obtained for all stars, and for a\nsize-able sub-set of the targets also Na abundances are obtained. The sodium\nabundances are used to distinguish stars formed out of pristine material from\nstars formed out of material affected by pollution from a previous generation\nof more massive stars. The dwarfs, turn-off, and early subgiant stars form a\nthin abundance plateau, disrupted in the middle of the subgiant branch by the\nlithium dilution caused by the first dredge-up. A second steep abundance drop\nis seen at the red giant branch bump. The turn-off stars are more lithium-poor,\nby up to 0.1 dex, than subgiants that have not yet undergone dredge-up. In\naddition, hotter dwarfs are slightly more lithium-poor than cooler dwarfs,\nwhich may be a signature of the so-called Li dip in the cluster, commonly seen\namong PopI stars. A considerably large spread in Na abundance confirms that\nNGC6397 has suffered from intra-cluster pollution in its infancy and a limited\nnumber of Na-enhanced and Li-deficient stars strongly contribute to form a\nsignificant anti-correlation between the abundances of Na and Li. The inferred\nLi abundances are compared to predictions from stellar structure models\nincluding atomic diffusion and ad-hoc turbulence below the convection zone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2009 09:14:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2009 11:23:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2009 13:42:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

For the effective\nnuclear interaction, we employ the relativistic mean field model supplemented\nby an isoscalar-isovector meson coupling that allows one to modify the density\ndependence of the symmetry energy without compromising the success of the model\nfor binding energies and charge radii. The semiclassical estimates of the\naverage energy of the GMR are known to be in good agreement with the results\nobtained in full RPA calculations. The present analysis is performed along the\nPb and Zr isotopic chains. In the scaling calculations, the excitation energy\nis larger when the symmetry energy is softer. The same happens in the\nconstrained calculations for nuclei with small and moderate neutron excess.\nHowever, for nuclei of large isospin the constrained excitation energy becomes\nsmaller in models having a soft symmetry energy. This effect is mainly due to\nthe presence of loosely-bound outer neutrons in these isotopes. A sharp\nincrease of the estimated width of the resonance is found in largely\nneutron-rich isotopes, even for heavy nuclei, which is enhanced when the\nsymmetry energy of the model is soft.

This feature may prove\nparticularly valuable for modeling the interaction of high-intensity laser\npulses with overcritical plasmas, in the case where the electrostatic modes in\nthe denser regions are of negligible influence on the physical processes under\nstudy. To this goal, we have developed the new two-dimensional electromagnetic\ncode ELIXIRS (standing for ELectromagnetic Implicit X-dimensional Iterative\nRelativistic Solver) based on the relativistic extension of the so-called\nDirect Implicit Method [D. Hewett and A. B. Langdon, J. Comp. Phys.\n\\textbf{72}, 121(1987)]. Dissipation-free propagation of light waves into\nvacuum is achieved by an adjustable-damping electromagnetic solver. In the\nhigh-density case where the Debye length is not resolved, satisfactory energy\nconservation is ensured by the use of high-order weight factors. In this paper,\nwe first present an original derivation of the electromagnetic direct implicit\nmethod within a Newton iterative scheme. Its linear properties are then\ninvestigated through numerically solving the relation dispersions obtained for\nboth light and plasma waves, accounting for finite space and time steps.\nFinally, our code is successfully benchmarked against explicit particle-in-cell\nsimulations for two kinds of physical problems: plasma expansion into vacuum\nand relativistic laser-plasma interaction. In both cases, we will demonstrate\nthe robustness of the implicit solver for crude discretizations, as well as the\ngains in efficiency which can be realized over standard explicit simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2009 09:18:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

A constellation\nbased at O is a set of infinitely near points of O, centers of a sequence of\nblow-ups above O. Finite constellations are usually encoded in two ways: either\nusing an Enriques diagram, or using the dual graph of the divisor obtained by\nblowing-up the points of the constellation. Both are decorated trees which\nencode completely the combinatorics of the constellation. Algorithms of passage\nfrom one to the other are known, but they do not allow to get a geometrical\npicture of their relation. We associate to a constellation a geometrical\nsimplicial complex of dimension two, called its kite, endowed with an affine\nstructure, and we prove that it contains canonically both the Enriques diagram\nand the dual graph. Moreover, the decorations of the two trees may be read very\neasily on the affine geometry of the kite. This allows to understand\ngeometrically the relations between the graphs, as well as their relation with\nthe valuative tree of Favre and Jonsson, which may be interpreted as the dual\ngraph of the constellation of all the points infinitely near O. In fact, the\nkites of finite constellations get glued into an infinite kite endowed with a\n1-dimensional foliation, whose space of leaves is the valuative tree. The\ntransition towards the computations with continued fractions is ensured by\npartial embeddings of the kites into a simplicial complex canonically\nassociated to a base of a lattice, called its lotus. This last notion is\nbriefly explored in any dimension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2009 13:36:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-27"}
