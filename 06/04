Several features of\nthe optimal strategy are revealed that are remarkably different from its\nno-transaction-cost counterpart. It is shown that there exists a critical\nlength in time, which is dependent on the stock excess return as well as the\ntransaction fees but independent of the investment target and the stock\nvolatility, so that an expected terminal return may not be achievable if the\nplanning horizon is shorter than that critical length (while in the absence of\ntransaction costs any expected return can be reached in an arbitrary period of\ntime). It is further demonstrated that anyone following the optimal strategy\nshould not buy the stock beyond the point when the time to maturity is shorter\nthan the aforementioned critical length. Moreover, the investor would be less\nlikely to buy the stock and more likely to sell the stock when the maturity\ndate is getting closer.

Unlike earlier studies, we consider a\nfinite mass of gas with explicit time dependence: we do not assume that the gas\nnecessarily adopts a steady state or a spatially constant accretion rate, i.e.\nthat the merging black hole was somehow inserted into a pre--existing accretion\ndisc. We consider the tidal torque of the binary on the disc, and the binary's\ngravitational radiation. We study the effects of star formation in the gas disc\nin a simple energy feedback framework. The disc spectrum differs in detail from\nthat found before. In particular, tidal torques from the secondary black hole\nheat the edges of the gap, creating bright rims around the secondary. These\nrims do not in practice have uniform brightness either in azimuth or time, but\ncan on average account for as much as 50 per cent of the integrated light from\nthe disc. This may lead to detectable high--photon--energy variability on the\nrelatively long orbital timescale of the secondary black hole, and thus offer a\nprospective signature of a coalescing black hole binary. We also find that the\ndisc can drive the binary to merger on a reasonable timescale only if its mass\nis at least comparable with that of the secondary black hole, and if the\ninitial binary separation is relatively small, i.e. $a_0 \\lesssim 0.05$ pc.\nStar formation complicates the merger further by removing mass from the disc.\nIn the feedback model we consider, this sets an effective limit to the disc\nmass. As a result, binary merging is unlikely unless the black hole mass ratio\nis $\\la 0.001$.

This phenomenon is\nknown as the Purcell effect, and the coupling strength between emitter and\ncavity can be quantified by the Purcell factor. The most natural way for\nprobing the Purcell effect is a time-resolved measurement. However, this\napproach is not always the most convenient one, and alternative approaches\nbased on a continuous-wave measurement are often more appropriate. Various\nsignatures of the Purcell effect can indeed be observed using continuous-wave\nmeasurements (increase of the pump rate needed to saturate the quantum dot\nemission, enhancement of its emission rate at saturation, change of its\nradiation pattern), signatures which are encountered when a quantum dot is put\non-resonance with the cavity mode. All these observations potentially allow one\nto estimate the Purcell factor. In this paper, we carry out these different\ntypes of measurements for a single quantum dot in a pillar microcavity and we\ncompare their reliability.

In this review, we discuss these\nrecent findings in the framework of M82 as a galaxy. It is known for almost\nhalf a century that M82 as a galaxy doesn't follow the trends expected for\nnormal galaxies that had prompted the morphologists to introduce a separate\nmorphological type under the name Irr II or amorphous. It is now being\nunderstood that the main reasons behind its apparently distinct morphological\nappearance are its peculiar star formation history, radial distribution of gas\ndensity and the form of the rotation curve. The disk formed almost all of its\nstars through a burst mode around 500 Myr ago, with the disk star formation\ncompletely quenched around 100 Myr ago. The fossil record of the disk-wide\nburst lies in the form of hundreds of compact star clusters, similar in mass to\nthat of the globular clusters in the Milky Way, but an order of magnitude\nyounger. The present star formation is restricted entirely to the central 500\npc zone, that contains more than 200 young compact star clusters. The disk\ncontains a non-star-forming spiral arm, hidden from the optical view by a\ncombination of extinction and high inclination to the line of sight. The halo\nof M82 is also unusual in its stellar content, with evidence for star\nformation, albeit at low levels, occurring continuously for over a gigayear. We\ncarefully examine each of the observed abnormality to investigate the overall\neffect of interaction on the evolution of M82.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2009 18:03:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-04"}

We produce a suite of minor\nmerger simulations for Milky Way-like galaxies. This suite consists of\ncollisionless simulations as well as hydrodynamical runs including a gaseous\ncomponent in the galactic disc. We find that in dissipationless simulations\nminor mergers cause the scale height of the disc to increase by up to a factor\nof ~2. When the presence of gas in the disc is taken into account this\nthickening is reduced by 25% (50%) for an initial disc gas fraction of 20%\n(40%), leading to a final scale height z0 between 0.6 and 0.7 kpc, regardless\nof the initial scale height. We argue that the presence of gas reduces disc\nheating via two mechanisms: absorption of kinetic impact energy by the gas\nand/or formation of a new thin stellar disc that can cause heated stars to\nrecontract towards the disc plane. We show that in our simulations most of the\ngas is consumed during the merger and thus the regrowth of a new thin disc has\na negligible impact on the z0 of the post merger galaxy. Final disc scale\nheights found in our simulations are in good agreement with studies of the\nvertical structure of spiral galaxies where the majority of the systems are\nfound to have scale heights of 0.4 kpc < z0 < 0.8 kpc.

We identify\ntwo important instabilities: the clumping instability and the banding\ninstability, and we show that both are cured by a suitable choice of kernel.\nThe second problem is the local mixing instability (LMI).

The result is a pressure discontinuity at boundaries that pushes\nfluids of different entropy apart.

Viscous evolution of the\nouter circumbinary disk initially hardens the binary, while the inner disk\ndrains onto the primary (central) black hole. As long as the inner disk remains\ncool and thin at low $\\dot{M}_{\\rm ext}$ (rather than becoming hot and\ngeometrically thick), the mass of the inner disk reaches an asymptotic mass\ntypically $\\sim 10^{-3}-10^{-4}\\Msun$. Once the semimajor axis shrinks below a\ncritical value, angular momentum losses from gravitational waves dominate over\nviscous transport in hardening the binary. The inner disk then no longer\nresponds viscously to the inspiraling black holes. Instead, tidal interactions\nwith the secondary rapidly drive the inner disk into the primary. Tidal and\nviscous dissipation in the inner disk lead to a late time brightening in\nluminosity $L\\propto t_{\\rm minus}^{5/4}$, where $t_{\\rm minus}$ is the time\nprior to the final merger. This late time brightening peaks $\\sim 1$ day prior\nto the final merger at $\\sim 0.1 L_{\\rm Edd}$. This behavior is relatively\nrobust because of self regulation in the coupled viscous-gravitational\nevolution of such binary systems.

It is usually proposed that hyperaccreting disks\nsurrounding stellar-mass black holes with a huge accretion rate are central\nengines of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). However, hyperaccretion disks around\nneutron stars may exist in some GRB formation scenarios. We study the structure\nand neutrino emission of a hyperaccretion disk around a neutron star. We\nconsider a steady-state hyperaccretion disk, and as a reasonable approximation,\ndivide it into two regions, the inner and outer disks. The outer disk is\nsimilar to that of a black hole. The inner disk has a self-similar structure,\nsuch as the entropy-conservation or the advection structure, depending on the\nenergy transfer and emission in the disk. We see that the neutron star disk can\ncool more efficiently, produce much higher neutrino luminosity and neutrino\nannihilation luminosity than a black hole disk. The neutrino emission from the\nneutron star surface boundary layer could increase the neutrino annihilation\nluminosity.\n  Moreover, we study the effects of a global magnetic field on\nviscously-rotating and vertically-integrated accretion disks around compact\nobjects using a self-similar treatment, and use two methods to study magnetized\nflows with convection.

In agreement with experimental results strong rotation is found to\nlead to anisotropy of the direct nonlinear energy flux, which is attenuated\nprimarily in the direction of the rotation axis. In decaying turbulence the\nevolution of kinetic energy follows an approximate power law with a distinct\ndependence of the decay exponent on the rotation frequency. A simple\nphenomenological relation between exponent and rotation rate reproduces this\nobservation. Stationary turbulence driven by large-scale forcing exhibits\n$k_\\perp^{-2}$-scaling in the rotation-dominated inertial range of the\none-dimensional energy spectrum taken perpendicularly to the rotation axis. The\nself-similar scaling is shown to be the cumulative result of individual\nspectral contributions which, for low rotation rate, display\n$k_\\perp^{-3}$-scaling near the $k_\\parallel=0$ plane. A phenomenology which\nincorporates the modification of the energy cascade by rotation is proposed. In\nthe observed regime the nonlinear turbulent interactions are strongly\ninfluenced by rotation but not suppressed. {Longitudinal two-point velocity\nstructure functions taken perpendicularly to the axis of rotation indicate weak\nintermittency of the $k_\\parallel=0$ (2D) component of the flow while the\nintermittent scaling of $k_\\parallel\\neq 0$ (3D) fluctuations is well captured\nby a modified She-L\\'ev\\^eque intermittency model which yields the expression\n$\\zeta_p=p/6 + 2(1-(2/3)^{p/2})$ for the structure function scaling exponents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2009 14:07:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The combination of a weak (subthermal) magnetic\nfield and Keplerian rotation is unstable to the magnetorotational instability\n(MRI), if the degree of ionization in the disk is sufficiently high. The MRI\nproduces enhanced angular momentum and leads to a breakdown of laminar flow\ninto turbulence. If the turbulent energy is dissipated locally, standard\n\"$\\alpha$\" modeling should give a reasonable estimate for the disk structure.\nBecause away from the central star the ionization fraction of protostellar\ndisks is small, they are generally not in the regime of near perfect\nconductivity. Nonideal MHD effects are important. Of these, Ohmic dissipation\nand Hall electromotive forces are the most important. The presence of dust is\nalso critical, as small interstellar scale grains absorb free charges that are\nneeded for good magnetic coupling. On scales of AU's there may be a region near\nthe disk midplane that is magnetically decoupled, a so-called {\\em dead zone.}\nBut the growth and settling of the grains as time evolves reduces their\nefficiency to absorb charge. With ionization provided by coronal X-rays from\nthe central star (and possibly also cosmic rays), protostellar disks may be\nsufficiently magnetized throughout most of their lives to be MRI active,\nespecially away from the disk midplane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2009 08:44:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-05"}

The\nearlier reported period of 244 days is confirmed. The results of monitoring the\n107 GHz methanol maser for two flares are also presented. The results show that\nflaring occurs in all three masing transitions. It is shown that the average\nflare profiles of the three masing transitions are similar. The 12.2 GHz masers\nare the most variable of the three masers with the largest relative amplitude\nhaving a value of 2.4. The flux densities for the different masing transitions\nare found to return to the same level during the low phase of the masers,\nsuggesting that the source of the periodic flaring is situated outside the\nmasing region, and that the physical conditions in the masing region are\nrelatively stable. On the basis of the shape of the light curve we excluded\nstellar pulsations as the underlying mechanism for the periodicity. It is\nargued that a colliding wind binary can account for the observed periodicity\nand provide a mechanism to qualitatively explain periodicity in the seed photon\nflux and/or the pumping radiation field. It is also argued that the dust\ncooling time is too short to explain the decay time of about 100 days of the\nmaser flare. A further analysis has shown that for the intervals from days 48\nto 66 and from days 67 to 135 the decay of the maser light curve can be\ninterpreted as due to the recombination of a thermal hydrogen plasma with\ndensities of approximately $1.6 \\times 10^6 \\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ and $6.0 \\times\n10^5 \\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2009 10:27:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Recently, in many problem\ndomains (e.g, program execution traces), a novel sequential pattern mining\nresearch, called mining repetitive gapped sequential patterns, has attracted\nthe attention of many researchers, considering not only the repetition of\nsequential pattern in different sequences but also the repetition within a\nsequence is more meaningful than the general sequential pattern mining which\nonly captures occurrences in different sequences. However, the number of\nrepetitive gapped sequential patterns generated by even these closed mining\nalgorithms may be too large to understand for users, especially when support\nthreshold is low. In this paper, we propose and study the problem of\ncompressing repetitive gapped sequential patterns. Inspired by the ideas of\nsummarizing frequent itemsets, RPglobal, we develop an algorithm, CRGSgrow\n(Compressing Repetitive Gapped Sequential pattern grow), including an efficient\npruning strategy, SyncScan, and an efficient representative pattern checking\nscheme, -dominate sequential pattern checking. The CRGSgrow is a two-step\napproach: in the first step, we obtain all closed repetitive sequential\npatterns as the candidate set of representative repetitive sequential patterns,\nand at the same time get the most of representative repetitive sequential\npatterns; in the second step, we only spend a little time in finding the\nremaining the representative patterns from the candidate set.

It\naccounts for most of the heterotrophic soil respiration and results in\nformation of more stable soil organic carbon (SOC) which is the largest\nterrestrial carbon stock. Litter decomposition may induce remarkable feedbacks\nto climate change because it is a climate-dependent process. To investigate the\nglobal patterns of litter decomposition, we developed a description of this\nprocess and tested the validity of this description using a large set of foliar\nlitter mass loss measurements (nearly 10 000 data points derived from\napproximately 70 000 litter bags). We applied the Markov chain Monte Carlo\nmethod to estimate uncertainty in the parameter values and results of our model\ncalled Yasso07. The model appeared globally applicable. It estimated the\neffects of litter type (plant species) and climate on mass loss with little\nsystematic error over the first 10 decomposition years, using only initial\nlitter chemistry, air temperature and precipitation as input variables.\nIllustrative of the global variability in litter mass loss rates, our example\ncalculations showed that a typical conifer litter had 68% of its initial mass\nstill remaining after two decomposition years in tundra while a deciduous\nlitter had only 15% remaining in the tropics. Uncertainty in these estimates, a\ndirect result of the uncertainty of the parameter values of the model, varied\naccording to the distribution of the litter bag data among climate conditions\nand ranged from 2% in tundra to 4% in the tropics. This reliability was\nadequate to use the model and distinguish the effects of even small differences\nin litter quality or climate conditions on litter decomposition as\nstatistically significant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2009 11:35:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-05"}

We show that all these contributions are suppressed\nby asymmetric leads, however they remain finite whenever leads intersect with\ntheir images under the symmetry operation. For an up-down symmetric dot, this\nmeans that the contributions can be finite even if one of the leads is\ncompletely asymmetric. We find that the suppression of the contributions to\nuniversal conductance fluctuations is the square of the suppression of\ncontributions to weak localization.

At low temperatures $T_{S}<T_{S}^{c1}$, the\nHamiltonian exhibits a spin-glass like phase, where the dynamics toward the\ntarget pattern require long time steps, and the fitness often decreases\ndrastically as a result of a single mutation to $\\bm{J}$.

This potential is a modification of the two\nscalar potential functions introduced by E. T. Whittaker. By use of a\ncomplexified Minkowski space $M$, we decompose the usual Lorentz group\nrepresentation on $M$ into a product of two commuting new representations.\nThese representations are based on the complex Faraday tensor. For a moving\ncharge and for any observer, we obtain a complex dimensionless scalar which is\ninvariant under one of our new representations. The scalar complex potential is\nthe logarithm of this dimensionless scalar times the charge value. We define a\nconjugation on $M$ which is invariant under our representation. We show that\nthe Faraday tensor is the derivative of the conjugate of the gradient of the\ncomplex potential. The real part of the Faraday tensor coincides with the usual\nelectromagnetic tensor of the field.\n  The potential $\\mathcal{S}$, as a complex-valued function on space-time, is\ndescribed as an integral over the distribution of the charges generating the\nelectromagnetic field.

We report new observations of the shell with HST. The knots in the shell\nare expanding with velocities 500-715 km/s, for a distance of 3500 pc. The\nfractional expansion of the knots is constant, and this implies no significant\ndeceleration. Hence, the knots were ejected by an eruption close to the year\n1866. Knots have turned on after 1995, and this demonstrates that the knots are\npowered by shocks from the collision of the 1866 ejecta with fast ejecta from\nlater RN eruptions. The 1866 ejecta has a total mass of 10^-4.5 Msun, which\nwith the low ejection velocity shows that the 1866 event was an ordinary nova\neruption, not a RN eruption. The accretion rate before the ordinary nova event\nmust have been low (around the 4x10^-11 Msun/yr expected for gravitational\nradiation alone) and the matter accumulated on the surface of the white dwarf\nfor ~750,000 years. The current accretion rate (>10^-8 Msun/yr) is 1000X higher\nthan expected for a system below the period gap, with the plausible reason\nbeing that the 1866 event started a continuing supersoft source that drives the\naccretion. A key fact about T Pyx is that its accretion rate has been secularly\ndeclining since before the 1890 eruption, with the current rate being only 3%\nof its earlier rate. The decline in the observed accretion rate shows that the\nsupersoft source is not self-sustaining, and we calculate that the accretion in\nT Pyx will effectively stop in upcoming decades. With this, T Pyx will enter a\nstate of hibernation, lasting for an estimated 2,600,000 years, before\ngravitational radiation brings the system into contact again. Thus, T Pyx has\nan evolutionary cycle going from an ordinary CV state, to its current RN state,\nto a future hibernation state, and then repeating this cycle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2009 15:31:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2009 16:47:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-17"}
