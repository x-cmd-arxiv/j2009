These particles escape detection, rendering their mass measurement\ndifficult. In the pair production of such particles via a specific (\"antler\")\ndecay topology, kinematic cusp structures are present in the invariant mass and\nangular distributions of the observable particles. Together with the\nend-points, such cusps can be used to measure the missing particle mass and the\nintermediate particle mass in the decay chain. Our simulation of a benchmark\nscenario in a Z' supersymmetric model shows that the cusp feature survives\nunder the consideration of detector simulation and the standard model\nbackgrounds. This technique for determining missing particle masses should be\ninvaluable in the search for new physics at the LHC and future lepton\ncolliders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Jun 2009 20:07:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2009 01:32:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2010 01:22:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

Our strategy\nis to start with a very simple model and then progressively improve it\nproviding complementary insight into results obtained with large numerical\nsimulations. In our first model, presented here, we work in the kinematic\napproximation and consider the stellar magnetic field as being a dipole aligned\nwith the stellar rotation axis and perpendicular to the disc plane, while the\nflow in the disc is taken to be steady and axisymmetric. The behaviour in the\nradial direction is then independent of that in the azimuthal direction. We\ninvestigate the distortion of the field caused by interaction with the disc\nmatter, solving the induction equation numerically in full 2D. The influence of\nturbulent diffusivity and fluid velocity on the poloidal field configuration is\nanalysed, including discussion of outflows from the top and bottom of the disc.\nWe find that the distortions increase with increasing magnetic Reynolds number\nR_m (calculated using the radial velocity). However, a single global parameter\ndoes not give an adequate description in different parts of the disc and we use\ninstead a `magnetic distortion function' D_m(r,\\theta) (a magnetic Reynolds\nnumber defined locally). Where D_m<<1 (near to the inner edge of the disc)\nthere is little distortion, but where D_m>1 (most of the rest of the disc),\nthere is considerable distortion and the field becomes weaker than the dipole\nwould have been. Between these two regions, there is a transition zone where\nthe field is amplified and can have a local minimum and maximum. The location\nof this zone depends sensitively on the diffusivity. The results depend very\nlittle on the boundary conditions at the top of the disc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Jun 2009 16:18:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2009 08:38:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2010 18:31:01 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 22 Oct 2010 18:31:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

Fundamental physical properties of this\nlocal enigmatic structure, known as the Gould belt (GB), have not been\nreproduced by previously proposed models. We first show that the local\nenigmatic structure can be formed about 30 Myr ago as a result of a high-speed,\noblique collision between a gas cloud with a mass of $\\sim 10^6 {\\rm\nM}_{\\odot}$ and a dark matter clump with a mass of $\\sim 10^7 {\\rm M}_{\\odot}$\nbased on numerical simulations of the collision.

We thus suggest that the GB is one\nof stellar substructures formed from collisions between gas clouds and dark\nmatter clumps predicted in the hierarchical clustering scenario of galaxy\nformation.

The\nwave-packet distribution of the probe enables one to investigate the smearing\neffect upon the measured vacuum fluctuations caused by the quantum nature of\nthe probe particle. It is shown that the wave-packet spread of the probe\nparticle significantly influences the measured velocity dispersion of the\nprobe. In particular, the asymptotic late-time behavior of its $z$-component, $\n< \\D v_{z}^{2}>$, for the wave-packet case is quite different from the test\npoint-particle case ($z$ is the coordinate normal to the plate). The result for\nthe wave-packet is $<\\D v_{z}^{2} > \\sim 1/\\t^2$ in the late time ($\\t$ is the\nmeasuring time), in stead of the reported late-time behavior $<\\D v_{z}^{2} >\n\\sim 1/z^2$ for a point-particle probe. This result can be quite significant\nfor further investigations on the measurement of vacuum fluctuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Jun 2009 15:48:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}
