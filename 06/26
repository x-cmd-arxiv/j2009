For\nsome time, researchers have realized that digital images may be modeled in much\nthe same way as these physical systems (i.e., as a square lattice of numerical\nvalues). A major drawback in using Potts model methods for image segmentation\nis that, with conventional methods, it processes in exponential time.

The bid optimizer is positioned as a key value added tool the search\nengine provides to the advertisers. The proposed bid optimizer algorithm\ntransforms the reported values of the advertisers for a keyword into a\ncorrelated bid profile using many ideas from cooperative game theory. The\nalgorithm is based on a characteristic form game involving the search engine\nand the advertisers. Ideas from Nash bargaining theory are used in formulating\nthe characteristic form game to provide for a fair share of surplus among the\nplayers involved. The algorithm then computes the nucleolus of the\ncharacteristic form game since we find that the nucleolus is an apt way of\nallocating the gains of cooperation among the search engine and the\nadvertisers. The algorithm next transforms the nucleolus into a correlated bid\nprofile using a linear programming formulation. This bid profile is input to a\nstandard generalized second price mechanism (GSP) for determining the\nallocation of sponsored slots and the prices to be be paid by the winners. The\ncorrelated bid profile that we determine is a locally envy-free equilibrium and\nalso a correlated equilibrium of the underlying game.

We argue there is a very well motivated theoretical preexisting\nframework consistent with dark matter annihilation being observed by the PAMELA\nsatellite detector. The dark matter is (mainly) the neutral W boson\nsuperpartner, the wino with mass below 200 GeV. Using the program GALPROP we\nstudy the annihilation products and backgrounds together. Antimatter and gammas\nfrom annihilating winos contribute below this energy. We explain why PAMELA\ndata does not imply no antiproton signal was observed by PAMELA or earlier\nexperiments, and explain why the antiproton analysis was misunderstood by\nearlier papers. Wino annihilation does not describe the Fermi e+ + e- data\n(except partially below ~ 100 GeV). At higher energies we expect astrophysical\nmechanisms, and we simply parameterize them so the combination can describe all\nthe data. We emphasize several predictions for satellite data to test the wino\ninterpretation, particularly the turndown of the positron and antiproton\nspectra above 100 GeV. Most other interpretations require a large rise in the\npositron rates above 100 GeV. We focus on studying this well-motivated and long\npredicted wino interpretation, rather than comparisons with other\ninterpretations. We emphasize that interpretations also depend very strongly on\nassumptions about the cosmological history of the universe, and on propagation\nof antiprotons and positrons in the galaxy. The winos PAMELA is observing arose\nfrom some non-thermal sources such as moduli decay rather than a universe that\ncooled in thermal equilibrium after the big bang. Then it is appropriate to\nnormalize the wino density to the local relic density, and no \"boost factors\"\nare needed to obtain the reported PAMELA rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 2009 18:35:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 2009 20:04:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 27 Jun 2009 05:24:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Although it cools efficiently, this gas remains\nrelatively hot, at a temperature near T ~ 8000 K, and consequently might be\nable to avoid fragmentation and collapse directly into a supermassive black\nhole (SMBH). In order for H_2--formation and cooling to be strongly suppressed,\nthe gas must be irradiated by a sufficiently intense ultraviolet (UV) flux. We\nperformed a suite of three--dimensional hydrodynamical adaptive mesh refinement\n(AMR) simulations of gas collapse in three different protogalactic halos with\nT_vir >~ 10^4 K, irradiated by a UV flux with various intensities and spectra.\nWe determined the critical specific intensity, Jcrit, required to suppress H_2\ncooling in each of the three halos. For a hard spectrum representative of\nmetal--free stars, we find (in units of 10^{-21} erg s^{-1} Hz^{-1} sr^{-1}\ncm^{-2}) 10^4<Jcrit<10^5, while for a softer spectrum, which is characteristic\nof a normal stellar population, and for which H^{-} --dissociation is\nimportant, we find 30<Jcrit<300. These values are a factor of 3--10 lower than\nprevious estimates. We attribute the difference to the higher, more accurate\nH_2 collisional dissociation rate we adopted. The reduction in Jcrit\nexponentially increases the number of rare halos exposed to super--critical\nradiation. When H_2 cooling is suppressed, gas collapse starts with a delay,\nbut it ultimately proceeds more rapidly. The infall velocity is near the\nincreased sound speed, and an object as massive as M ~ 10^5 solar mass may form\nat the center of these halos, compared to the M ~ 10^2 solar mass stars forming\nwhen H_2--cooling is efficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 2009 18:48:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

A longstanding issue is whether the change in the\nshapes of DM halos is the result of chaotic scattering of box orbits, or\nwhether they change shape adiabatically in response to the evolving galactic\npotential. We use orbital frequencies to classify orbits, to quantify orbital\nshapes, and to identify resonant orbits and chaotic orbits. The frequency-based\nmethod overcomes the limitations of Lyapunov exponents which are sensitive to\nnumerical discreteness effects. Regardless of the distribution of the baryonic\ncomponent, the shape of a DM halo changes primarily due to changes in the\nshapes of individual orbits within a given family. Orbits with small\npericentric radii are more likely to change both their orbital type and shape\nthan orbits with large pericentric radii. Whether the evolution is regular (and\nreversible) or chaotic (and irreversible), depends primarily on the radial\ndistribution of the baryonic component. The growth of an extended baryonic\ncomponent of any shape results in a regular rather than chaotic change in\norbital populations. In contrast the growth of a massive and compact central\ncomponent results in chaotic scattering of a significant fraction of both box\nand long-axis tube orbits. The growth of a disk causes a significant fraction\nof halo particles to become trapped by major global orbital resonances.

We have analyzed the\nchaotic behavior of the known Centaurs.

We further find that these\ntwo types of behavior are correlated with Centaur dynamical lifetime: most\nCentaurs whose dynamical lifetime is less than ~22 Myr exhibit generalized\ndiffusion, whereas most Centaurs of longer dynamical lifetimes exhibit\nintermittent resonance sticking. We also find that Centaurs in the diffusing\nclass are likely to evolve into Jupiter-family comets during their dynamical\nlifetimes, while those in the resonance-hopping class do not.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 2009 21:14:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The quest for ultra-compact laser that can\ndirectly generate coherent optical fields at the nano-scale, far beyond the\ndiffraction limit of light, remains a key fundamental challenge. Microscopic\nlasers based on photonic crystals, micro-disks, metal clad cavities and\nnanowires can now reach the diffraction limit, which restricts both the optical\nmode size and physical device dimension to be larger than half a wavelength.\nWhile surface plasmons are capable of tightly localizing light, ohmic loss at\noptical frequencies has inhibited the realization of truly nano-scale lasers.\nRecent theory has proposed a way to significantly reduce plasmonic loss while\nmaintaining ultra-small modes by using a hybrid plasmonic waveguide. Using this\napproach, we report an experimental demonstration of nano-scale plasmonic\nlasers producing optical modes 100 times smaller than the diffraction limit,\nutilizing a high gain Cadmium Sulphide semiconductor nanowire atop a Silver\nsurface separated by a 5 nm thick insulating gap. Direct measurements of\nemission lifetime reveal a broad-band enhancement of the nanowire's spontaneous\nemission rate by up to 6 times due to the strong mode confinement and the\nsignature of apparently threshold-less lasing. Since plasmonic modes have no\ncut-off, we show down-scaling of the lateral dimensions of both device and\noptical mode. As these optical coherent sources approach molecular and\nelectronics length scales, plasmonic lasers offer the possibility to explore\nextreme interactions between light and matter, opening new avenues in active\nphotonic circuits, bio-sensing and quantum information technology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 2009 22:27:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-29"}

We analyzed a large set\nof geodetic VLBI data spanning from 1979 till 2008 to estimate the dipole and\nthe quadrupole harmonics in the expansion of the vector field of the proper\nmotions of quasars in the sky.

The critical boundary regime is characterized by a one-parameter family\nof scaling functions interpolating between the Brownian map and the Brownian\nContinuum Random Tree.

The most\nimportant result is that for a functional $\\lambda$ on the Lie algebra\n$\\mathfrak t$ of a maximal torus in a compact connected Lie group the\nstabilizer is of the form $C(T_1)$ for a smaller torus $T_1$. This allows us to\ndefine a complex structure on the coadjoint orbit $\\mathcal O_\\lambda =\nG/C(T_1)$. In the second chapter we present the Borel-Weil Theorem which tells\nus that all irreducible unitary representations of a compact connected Lie\ngroup can be realized in the space of holomorphic sections of the bundle\n$G\\times_\\tau\\mathbb C$, where $\\tau$ is a character of a maximal torus.\nFinally, in the third chapter we show that coadjoint orbits are symplectic\nmanifolds for which prequantization yields a complex line bundle. Then we\ninvestigate for which classes of coadjoint orbits one obtains representations\nin the space of polarized sections of the prequantum bundle. This will lead us\nback to the result of Borel-Weil.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2009 12:07:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-29"}

These\nground-based observations were collected in the GAUDI archive. High-resolution\nspectra of more than 200 B-type stars are available in this database, and about\n45% of them is analysed here. To derive the effective temperature of the stars,\nwe used photometric indices. Surface gravities were obtained by comparing\nobserved and theoretical Balmer line profiles. To determine the chemical\nabundances and rotational velocities, we used a spectrum synthesis method,\nwhich consisted of comparing the observed spectrum with theoretical ones based\non the assumption of LTE. Atmospheric parameters, chemical abundances, and\nrotational velocities were determined for 89 late-B stars. The dominant species\nin their spectra are iron-peak elements. The average Fe abundance is\n7.24+/-0.45 dex. The average rotational velocity is 126 km/sec, but there are\n13 and 20 stars with low and moderate Vsin i values, respectively. The analysis\nof this sample of 89 late B-type stars reveals many chemically peculiar (CP)\nstars. Some of them were previously known, but at least 9 new CP candidates,\namong which at least two HgMn stars, are identified in our study. These CP\nstars as a group exhibit Vsin i values lower than the stars with normal surface\nchemical composition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2009 13:49:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Recently, a lot of attention has been paid to models\npopulated by vector fields, given the interesting possibility of generating\nsome level of statistical anisotropy in the cosmological perturbations. The\nscenario we propose is strongly motivated by the fact that, for non-Abelian\ngauge fields, self-interactions are responsible for generating extra terms in\nthe cosmological correlation functions, which are naturally absent in the\nAbelian case. We compute these extra contributions to the bispectrum of the\ncurvature perturbation, using the delta N formula and the Schwinger-Keldysh\nformalism. The primordial violation of rotational invariance (due to the\nintroduction of the SU(2) gauge multiplet) leaves its imprint on the\ncorrelation functions introducing, as expected, some degree of statistical\nanisotropy in our results.

Among these, some are shown to verify a Birkhoff type staticity\ntheorem, although here, the usual assumption of maximal symmetry on the horizon\nis relaxed, allowing exotic horizon geometries. We provide explicit examples of\nsuch static exotic black holes, including ones whose horizon geometry is that\nof a Bergman space. We find that the situation is very different from\nhigher-dimensional general relativity, where Einstein spaces are admissible\nblack hole horizons and the associated black hole potential is not even\naffected. In Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory, on the contrary, the non-trivial\nWeyl tensor of such exotic horizons is exposed to the bulk dynamics through the\nhigher order Gauss-Bonnet term, severely constraining the allowed horizon\ngeometries and adding a novel charge-like parameter to the black hole\npotential. The latter is related to the Euler characteristic of the\nfour-dimensional horizon and provides, in some cases, additional black hole\nhorizons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2009 14:26:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2009 09:11:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-29"}

The D-brane embeddings near the point of the topology\nchange exhibit a scaling symmetry. The associated scaling exponents can be\neither real- or complex-valued. Which regime applies depends on the\ndimensionality of a collapsing submanifold in the critical embedding. When the\nscaling exponents are complex-valued, a first-order transition associated with\nthe flavor fields appears in the dual field theory. Real scaling exponents are\nexpected to be associated with a continuous transition in the dual field\ntheory. For one example with real exponents, the D7-brane, we study the\ntransition in detail. We find two field theory observables that diverge at the\ncritical point, and we compute the associated critical exponents.

In Yb3Pt4, the Yb\nmoments sit on a single low-symmetry site in the rhombohedral lattice with\nspace group R-3. The Yb ions form octahedra with edges that are twisted with\nrespect to the hexagonal unit cell, a twisting that results in every Yb ion\nhaving exactly one Yb nearest neighbor. Below TN, we found new diffracted\nintensity due to a k=0 magnetic structure. This magnetic structure was compared\nto all symmetry-allowed magnetic structures, and was subsequently refined. The\nbest fitting magnetic structure model is antiferromagnetic, and involves pairs\nof Yb nearest neighbors on which the moments point almost exactly towards each\nother. This structure has moment components within the ab-plane as well as\nparallel to the c-axis, although the easy magnetization direction lies in the\nab-plane. Our magnetization results suggest that besides the crystal-electric\nfield anisotropy, anisotropic exchange favoring alignment along the c-axis is\nresponsible for the overall direction of the ordered moments. The magnitude of\nthe ordered Yb moments in Yb3Pt4 is 0.81 uB/Yb at 1.4 K. The analysis of the\nbulk properties, the size of the ordered moment, and the observation of\nwell-defined crystal-field levels argue that the Yb moments are spatially\nlocalized in zero field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2009 15:10:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

These results have\npreviously been obtained in two quite different ways. Either by a\n``scalarization of the sources'', where the relevant scalar quantities are\nessentially vector potential components and where the derivation was limited to\nisotropic media; or alternatively by using the ``scalar Hertz potentials'', and\nthis method has been applied to more general media. In this paper it is shown\nthat both methods are equivalent for gyrotropic media.

It is shown that the 2 basic\nscalar Hertz potentials occurring in the second method are invariant under the\nsource scalarization transformations of the first method and therefore are the\nnatural potentials for obtaining scalarization.

The EPIC cameras onboard the XMM-Newton satellite allow to\nefficiently search for new thermally emitting INSs. We used the 2XMMp catalogue\nto select sources with no catalogued candidate counterparts and with X-ray\nspectra similar to those of the M7, but seen at greater distances and thus\nundergoing higher interstellar absorptions. Identifications in more than 170\nastronomical catalogues and visual screening allowed to select fewer than 30\ngood INS candidates.
