This phenomenon is\ncommonly referred to as the \"coffee-ring\" effect. One paradigm for why this\noccurs is as a consequence of the solutes being transported towards the pinned\ncontact line by the flow inside the drop, which is induced by surface\nevaporation. From this perspective, the role of the liquid-gas interface in\nshaping the deposition pattern is somewhat minimized. Here, we propose an\nalternative mechanism for the coffee-ring deposition. It is based on the bulk\nflow within the drop transporting particles to the interface where they are\ncaptured by the receding free surface and subsequently transported along the\ninterface until they are deposited near the contact line. That the interface\ncaptures the solutes as the evaporation proceeds is supported by a Lagrangian\ntracing of particles advected by the flow field within the droplet. We model\nthe interfacial adsorption and transport of particles as a one-dimensional\nadvection-generation process in toroidal coordinates and show that the theory\nreproduces ring-shaped depositions. Using this model, deposition patterns on\nboth hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces are examined in which the evaporation\nis modeled as being either diffusive or uniform over the surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Jun 2009 17:00:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 10 Dec 2016 04:31:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-14"}

Following a summary of the historical eras of\nspacecraft charging and some observations from experimental satellites: SCATHA,\nCRRES and DMSP, environmental factors significant to spacecraft charging are\ndiscussed, including plasma interactions, electric and magnetic fields and\nsolar radiation. Spacecraft charging depends on the spacecraft geometry, as\nwell as on the characteristics of its orbit, since the natural environment may\ndiffer for each type of orbit. Low altitude orbiting satellites (LEO) usually\nexperience less charging effects than high altitude geosynchronous (GEO)\nsatellites, except for low altitude polar orbiting satellites which cross the\nauroral oval.

The\noptimal fraction of power allocated to training is identified.

The\nparent body of this family, Haumea, is one of the largest objects in the Kuiper\nbelt and is orbited by two satellites. It has been proposed that the Haumea\nfamily was created from dispersed fragments that resulted from a giant impact.\nThis proposed origin of the Haumea family is however in conflict with the\nobserved velocity dispersion between the family members (\\sim 140 m/s) which is\nsignificantly less than the escape velocity from Haumea's surface (\\sim 900\nm/s). In this paper we propose a different formation scenario for Haumea's\ncollisional family. In our scenario the family members are ejected while in\norbit around Haumea. This scenario, therefore, gives naturally rise to a lower\nvelocity dispersion among the family members than expected from direct ejection\nfrom Haumea's surface. In our scenario Haumea's giant impact forms a single\nmoon that tidally evolves outward until it suffers a destructive collision from\nwhich the family is created. We show that this formation scenario yields a\nvelocity dispersion of \\sim 190m/s among the family members which is in good\nagreement with the observations. The probability for Haumea's initial giant\nimpact in todays Kuiper belt is less than 10^{-3}. In our scenario, however,\nHaumea's giant impact can occur before the excitation of the Kuiper belt and\nthe ejection of the family members afterwards. This has the advantage that one\ncan preserve the dynamical coherence of the family and explain Haumea's\noriginal giant impact, which is several orders of magnitude more likely to have\noccurred in the primordial dynamically cold Kuiper belt compared to the\ndynamically excited Kuiper belt today.

However, pulsars at\nsouthern declinations have been under-represented in previous interferometric\nastrometry campaigns. In order to redress this imbalance, we have conducted a\ntwo-year astrometric campaign targeting eight southern pulsars with the\nAustralian Long Baseline Array. The program summarized in this paper has\nresulted in the measurement of seven new pulsar parallaxes, with success on\nobjects down to a mean flux density of 0.8 mJy at 1600 MHz. Our results\nhighlight the substantial uncertainties that remain when utilizing free\nelectron density models for individual pulsar distances.

In\nthis article we apply this technique to the strong approximation bivariate\ntheorems of the uniform empirical process. It improves the Komlos, Major and\nTusn\\'ady (1975) result, as well as our own (1998). More precisely, we show\nthat the error in the approximation of the uniform bivariate $n$-empirical\nprocess by a bivariate Brownian bridge is of order $n^{-1/2}(log (nab))^{3/2}$\non the rectangle $[0,a]x[0,b]$, $0 <a, b <1$, and that the error in the\napproximation of the uniform univariate $n$-empirical process by a Kiefer\nprocess is of order $n^{-1/2}(log (na))^{3/2}$ on the interval $[0,a]$, $0 < a\n< 1$. In both cases, the global error bound is therefore of order $n^{-1/2}(log\n(n))^{3/2}$. Previously, from the 1975 article of Komlos, Major and Tusn\\'ady,\nthe global error bound was of order $n^{-1/2}(log (n))^{2}$, and from our 1998\narticle, the local error bounds were of order $n^{-1/2}(log (nab))^{2}$ or\n$n^{-1/2}(log (na))^{2}$. We think that, in the d-variate case, the global\nerror bound between the uniform d-variate $n$-empirical process and the\nassociated Gaussian process is of order $n^{-1/2}(log (n))^{(d+1)/2}$, and that\nthis result is optimal. The new feature of this article is to identify\nmartingales in the error terms and to apply to them an exponential inequality.\nThe idea is to bound of the compensator of the error term, instead of bounding\nof the error term itself.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2009 08:41:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-23"}

The source shows dips as well as\neclipses, hence it is viewed close to edge-on. We modeled the spectral changes\nbetween persistent and dips in the framework of the partial covering model and\nthe ionized absorber approach. The persistent spectrum can be fit by a power\nlaw with a photon index of 1.94(+-0.02) affected by absorption from cool\nmaterial with a hydrogen column density of 0.401(+-0.007)*10^22 cm^-2.

We do\nnot detect any absorption lines from highly ionized species such as FeXXV. The\nupper-limits we derive on their equivalent width (EW) are not constraining.\nDespite not detecting any signatures of a warm absorber, we show that the\nspectral changes are consistent with an increase in column density\n(4.3(-0.5;+0.4)*10^22 cm^-2 during shallow dipping to 11.6(-0.6;+0.4)*10^22\ncm^-2 during deep dipping) and a decrease in ionization state of a\nhighly-ionized absorber (10^2.52 during shallow dipping to 10^2.29 erg.s^-1.cm\nduring deep dipping), associated with a slight increase in the column density\nof a neutral absorber. The parameters of the ionized absorber are not\nconstrained during persistent emission. The warm absorber model better accounts\nfor the ~1 keV depression visible in the pn dipping spectra, and naturally\nexplains it as a blend of lines and edges unresolved by pn.

These humps were already observed on one night by Tramposch et al.\n(2005), who additionally observed superhumps during a superoutburst.\nRemarkably, from scant evidence at their disposal they were able to discern\nthem as negative and positive (common) superhumps, respectively. Our period in\nquiescence clearly different from their superhump period confirmed this. Our\ndiscovery of an additional modulation, attributed by us to the orbital wave,\ncompletes the overall picture. Lack of superhumps in our data indicates that\nall eruptions we observed were ordinary outbursts. The earlier observation of\nthe superhumps combined with the presence of the ordinary outbursts in our data\nenables classification of SDSS J2100 as an active SU UMa dwarf nova.\nAdditionally, we have promoted SDSS J2100 to the group of cataclysmic variables\nexhibiting three periodic modulations of light from their accretion discs. We\nupdated available information on positive and negative superhumps and thus\nprovided enhanced evidence that their properties are strongly correlated\nmutually as well as with the orbital period. By recourse to these relations we\nwere able to remove an alias ambiguity and to identify the orbital period of\nSDSS J2100 of 0.083304(6) days. SDSS J21000 is only third SU UMa dwarf nova\nshowing both positive and negative superhumps. Their respective period excess\nand deficit equal to 4.99(3)% and -2.660(8)%, yielding the mass ratio q=0.24.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2009 09:25:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The set\nitself is termed the basin of attraction and the features are at the center of\nour attention. Extending to more qubits, we find that attractors are a generic\nfeature of the multi qubit Jaynes Cummings model (JCM) and we therefore\ngeneralise the discovery by Gea-Banacloche for the one qubit case. We give the\n`basin of attraction' for $N_q$ qubits and discuss the implications of the\n`attractor' state in terms of the dynamics of $N_q$-body entanglement. We\nobserve both collapse and revival and sudden birth/death of entanglement\ndepending on the initial conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2009 12:01:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

In many planet-forming disks, the\nType I migration mechanism, driven by asymmetric torques, acts on a short time\nscale and compromises planet formation. If the disk also supports MHD\ninstabilities, however, the corresponding turbulent fluctuations produce\nadditional stochastic torques that modify the steady inward migration scenario.\nThis work studies the migration of planetary cores in the presence of\nstochastic fluctuations using complementary methods, including a Fokker-Planck\napproach and iterative maps. Stochastic torques have two main effects: [1]\nThrough outward diffusion, a small fraction of the planetary cores can survive\nin the face of Type I inward migration. [2] For a given starting condition, the\nresult of any particular realization of migration is uncertain, so that results\nmust be described in terms of the distributions of outcomes. In addition to\nexploring different regimes of parameter space, this paper considers the\neffects of the outer disk boundary condition, varying initial conditions, and\ntime-dependence of the torque parameters. For disks with finite radii, the\nfraction of surviving planets decreases exponentially with time. We find the\nsurvival fractions and decay rates for a range of disk models, and find the\nexpected distribution of locations for surviving planets. For expected disk\nproperties, the survival fraction lies in the range $0.01 < p_S < 0.1$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2009 15:07:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}
