Three-dimensional\nnumerical simulations are used to study turbulent transport under the\ninfluences of large-scale shear and rotation in homogeneous, isotropically\nforced turbulence. We study three cases: one with only shear, and two others\nwhere in addition to shear, rotation is present. These cases differ by the\nangle (0 or 90\\degr) the rotation vector makes with respect to the z-direction.\nTwo subsets of runs are performed with both values of \\theta where either\nrotation or shear is kept constant. When only shear is present, the\noff-diagonal stress can be described by turbulent viscosity whereas if the\nsystem also rotates, nondiffusive contributions (\\Lambda-effect) to the stress\ncan arise. Comparison of the direct simulations are made with analytical\nresults from a simple closure model. We find that the turbulent viscosity is of\nthe order of the first order smoothing result in the parameter regime studied\nand that for sufficiently large Reynolds numbers the Strouhal number,\ndescribing the ratio of correlation to turnover times, is roughly 1.5. This is\nconsistent with the closure model based on the minimal tau-approximation which\nproduces a reasonable fit to the simulation data for similar Strouhal numbers.\nIn the cases where rotation is present, separating the diffusive and\nnondiffusive components of the stress turns out to be challenging but taking\nthe results at face value, we can obtain nondiffusive contributions of the\norder of 0.1 times the turbulent viscosity. We also find that the simple\nclosure model is able to reproduce most of the qualitative features of the\nnumerical results provided that the Strouhal number is of the order of unity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jun 2009 16:38:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2009 20:24:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-19"}

Habitable planets then enjoy no astrospheric buffering\nfrom the full flux of Galactic cosmic rays and interstellar dust and gas, a\nsituation we call ``descreening.'' Recent papers (Yeghikyan and Fahr, Pavlov et\nal.) have suggested such global consequences as severe ozone depletion and\nglaciation. Using a ram-pressure balance model that includes gravitational\nfocusing of the interstellar flow, we compute the size of the astrosphere in\nthe apex direction as a function of parent star mass. We derive a dependence on\nthe parent-star mass M due to gravitational focusing for densities larger than\nabout 100 (M/M_\\odot)^{-2} cm^{-3}.

This\ncollection of data implies that the hot gas in the Galactic halo is not\nisothermal, but its temperature spans a relatively wide range from ~10^{5.0} K\nto ~10^{7.0} K. We therefore construct a differential emission measure (DEM)\nmodel for the halo's hot gas, consisting of two components.

Such\nmisalignment results in flavor-violating couplings to the Higgs and hence\nflavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) processes from tree-level Higgs\nexchange. We perform a model-independent analysis of such an effect.\nSpecializing to the framework of a composite Higgs with partially composite SM\ngauge and fermion fields, we show that the constraints on the compositeness\nscale implied by epsilon_K can be generically as strong as those from the\nexchange of heavy spin-1 resonances if the Higgs is light and strongly coupled\nto the new states. In the special and well motivated case of a composite\npseudo-Goldstone Higgs, we find that the shift symmetry acting on the Higgs\nforces an alignment of the fermion mass terms with their Yukawa couplings at\nleading order in the fermions' degree of compositeness, thus implying much\nmilder bounds. As a consequence of the flavor-violating Higgs couplings, we\nestimate BR(t -> c h) ~ 10^{-4} and BR(h -> tc) ~ 5 x 10^{-3} both for a\npseudo-Goldstone (if t_R is fully composite) and for a generic composite Higgs.\nBy virtue of the AdS/CFT correspondence, our results directly apply to\n5-dimensional Randall-Sundrum compactifications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jun 2009 17:15:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2009 10:53:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-05"}

The\nsize of any subset varies between p to k (p < k). In addition, we assume that\nthe input contains all possible subsets of size p. Our objective is to find a\nsubcollection of minimum-cardinality which covers all the elements. This\nproblem is known to be NP-hard. We provide two approximation algorithms for it,\none for the generic case, and an improved one for the special case of (p,k) =\n(2,4). The algorithm for the generic case is a greedy one, based on packing\nphases: at each phase we pick a collection of disjoint subsets covering i new\nelements, starting from i = k down to i = p+1. At a final step we cover the\nremaining base elements by the subsets of size p. We derive the exact\nperformance guarantee of this algorithm for all values of k and p, which is\nless than Hk, where Hk is the k'th harmonic number. However, the algorithm\nexhibits the known improvement methods over the greedy one for the unweighted\nk-set cover problem (in which subset sizes are only restricted not to exceed\nk), and hence it serves as a benchmark for our improved algorithm. The improved\nalgorithm for the special case of (p,k) = (2,4) is based on non-oblivious local\nsearch: it starts with a feasible cover, and then repeatedly tries to replace\nsets of size 3 and 4 so as to maximize an objective function which prefers big\nsets over small ones. For this case, our generic algorithm achieves an\nasymptotic approximation ratio of 1.5 + epsilon, and the local search algorithm\nachieves a better ratio, which is bounded by 1.458333... + epsilon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jun 2009 18:26:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-09"}

Measurements of cosmic\nmicrowave background anisotropies suggest that this phase-change largely took\nplace in the redshift range z=10.8 +/- 1.4, while observations of quasars and\nLyman-alpha galaxies have shown that the process was essentially completed by\nz=6. However, the detailed history of reionization, and characteristics of the\nstars and proto-galaxies that drove it, remain unknown. Further progress in\nunderstanding requires direct observations of the sources of ultra-violet\nradiation in the era of reionization, and mapping the evolution of the neutral\nhydrogen fraction through time. The detection of galaxies at such redshifts is\nhighly challenging, due to their intrinsic faintness and high luminosity\ndistance, whilst bright quasars appear to be rare beyond z~7.

This experiment assesses the frequency of planet ingestion\nand rapid rotation on the red giant branch (RGB) for a sample of 99 known\nexoplanet host stars. We find that the known exoplanets are indeed capable of\ncreating rapid rotators; however, the expected fraction due to planet ingestion\nis only ~10% of the total seen in surveys of present-day red giants.

We study the evolution of accreting protostars and\nthe limits of accretion in low metallicity environments. Accretion rates onto\nprotostars are estimated via the temperature evolution of prestellar cores with\ndifferent metallicities. The derived rates increase with decreasing\nmetallicity, from 10^-6 M_sun/yr at Z = Z_sun to 10^-3 M_sun/yr at Z = 0. With\nthe derived accretion rates, the protostellar evolution is numerically\ncalculated. We find that, at lower metallicity, the protostar has a larger\nradius and reaches the zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) at higher stellar mass.\nUsing this protostellar evolution, we evaluate the upper stellar mass limit\nwhere the mass accretion is hindered by radiative feedback. We consider the\neffects of radiation pressure exerted on the accreting envelope, and expansion\nof the HII region. The mass accretion is finally terminated by radiation\npressure on dust grains in the envelope for Z > 10^-3 Z_sun and by the\nexpanding HII region for lower metallicty. The mass limit from these effects\nincreases with decreasing metallicity from 10 M_sun at Z = Z_sun to about 300\nM_sun at Z = 10^-6 Z_sun. The termination of accretion occurs after the central\nstar arrives at the ZAMS at all metallicities, which allows us to neglect\nprotostellar evolution effects in discussing the upper mass limit by stellar\nfeedback.

The method of image charges, originally\ndescribed by J. C. Maxwell in 1873, has been and continues to be a useful\nmethod for solving many three dimensional electrostatic problems. Here we\ndemonstrate that as expected when the series is truncated to any finite order\nN, the electric field resulting from the truncated series becomes qualitatively\nmore similar to the correct field as N increases. A method of charge\nnormalization is developed which provides significant improvement for truncated\nlow order solutions. The formulation of the normalization technique and its\nsolution via a matrix inversion has similarities to the method of moments,\nwhich is a numerical solution of Poisson's equation, using an integral equation\nfor the unknown charge density with a known boundary potential. The last\nsection of this paper presents a gradient search method to optimize a set of L\npoint charges for M spheres. This method may use the image charge series to\ninitialize the gradient search. We demonstrate quantitatively how the metric\ncan be optimized by adjusting the locations and amounts of charge for the set\nof points, and that an optimized set of charges generally performs better than\ntruncated normalized image charges, at the expense of gradient search iteration\ntime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2009 00:24:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

This scenario was developed to replace and extend the\nso-called standard cooling scenario to include neutrino emission from the\nCooper pair breaking and formation processes that occur near the critical\ntemperature for superfluid/superconductor pairing.\n  Recently, it has been found that Cooper-pair neutrino emission from the\nvector channel is suppressed by a large factor compared to the original\nestimates that violated vector current conservation. We show that Cooper-pair\nneutrino emission remains, nevertheless, an efficient cooling mechanism through\nthe axial channel. As a result, the elimination of neutrino emission from\nCooper-paired nucleons through the vector channel has only minor effects on the\nlong-term cooling of neutron stars within the minimal cooling paradigm. We\nfurther quantify precisely the effect of the size of the neutron 3P2 gap and\ndemonstrate that consistency between observations and the minimal cooling\nparadigm requires that the critical temperature T_c for this gap covers a range\nof values between T_c^min < 0.2 x 10^9 K up to T_c^max > 0.5 \\times 10^9 K in\nthe core of the star. In addition, it is required that young neutron stars have\nheterogenous envelope compositions: some must have light-element compositions\nand others must have heavy-element compositions. Unless these two conditions\nare fulfilled, about half of the observed young cooling neutron stars are\ninconsistent with the minimal cooling paradigm and provide evidence for the\nexistence of enhanced cooling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2009 01:56:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-08"}

(TAC, 2004) considered the problem of optimal estimation for\nlinear systems with Gaussian noise and intermittent observations, available\naccording to a Bernoulli arrival process. They showed that there is a\n\"critical\" arrival probability of the observations, such that under that\nthreshold the expected value of the covariance matrix (i.e., the quadratic\nerror) of the estimate is unbounded. Sinopoli et al., and successive authors,\ninterpreted this result implying that the behavior of the system is\nqualitatively different above and below the threshold. This paper shows that\nthis is not necessarily the only interpretation. In fact, the critical\nprobability is different if one considers the average error instead of the\naverage quadratic error. More generally, finding a meaningful \"average\"\ncovariance is not as simple as taking the algebraic expected value. A rigorous\nway to frame the problem is in a differential geometric framework, by\nrecognizing that the set of covariance matrices (or better, the manifold of\nGaussian distributions) is not a flat space, and then studying the intrinsic\nRiemannian mean. Several metrics on this manifold are considered that lead to\ndifferent critical probabilities, or no critical probability at all.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2009 05:32:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-10"}

We focus on investigating the properties of the dark matter halos inside\nthese structures, in particular on the directions of their spins and the\norientation of their shapes with respect to the directions of the filaments and\nsheets. We find that both the spin and the major axes of filament-halos with\nmasses <= 10^{13} M_sun/h are preferentially aligned with the direction of the\nfilaments. The spins and major axes of halos in sheets tend to lie parallel to\nthe sheets. There is an opposite mass dependence of the alignment strengths for\nthe spin (negative) and major (positive) axes, i.e. with increasing halo mass\nthe major axis tends to be more strongly aligned with the direction of the\nfilament whereas the alignment between halo spin and filament becomes weaker\nwith increasing halo mass. The alignment strengths as a function of distance to\nthe most massive node halo indicate that there is a transit large scale\nenvironment impact: from the 2-D collapse phase of the filament to the 3-D\ncollapse phase of the cluster/node halo at small separation. Overall, the two\nalgorithms for filament/sheet identification investigated here agree well with\neach other. The method based on halos alone can be easily adapted for use with\nobservational data sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2009 07:53:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2009 17:02:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2009 06:31:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The model galaxy is employed from an ultra-high-resolution\nchemodynamic simulation of a primordial galaxy by Mori & Umemura (2006),which\nwell reproduces the observed properties of LAEs and LBGs. The total mass of\nmodel galaxy is 10^{11}M_sun. We solve not only photo-ionization but also\ncollisional ionization by shocks. In addition, according to the chemical\nenrichment, we incorporate the effect of dust extinction, taking the size\ndistributions of dust into account. As a result, we find that dust extinction\nreduces the escape fractions by a factor 1.5-8.5 in the LAE phase and by a\nfactor 2.5-11 in the LBG phase, while the collisional ionization by shocks\nincreases the escape fractions by a factor ~ 2. The resultant escape fractions\nare 0.07-0.47 in the LAE phase and 0.06-0.17 in the LBG phase. These results\nare well concordant with the recent estimations derived from the flux ratio at\n1500 angstrom to 900 angstrom of LAEs and LBGs. Combining the resultant escape\nfractions with the luminosity functions of LAEs and LBGs, we find that high-z\nLAEs and LBGs can ionize the IGM at z=3-5. However, ionizing radiation from\nLAEs as well as LBGs falls short to ionize the IGM at z>6.

This paper focuses on the needs\nfor a user-centered knowledge management approach as well as exploitation of\nassociated temporal properties. Our perspective of knowledge is with respect to\ndecision-problems projects in EI. Our hypothesis is that the possibility of\nreasoning about temporal properties in exploitation of knowledge in EI projects\nshould foster timely decision making through generation of useful inferences\nfrom available and reusable knowledge for a new project.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2009 09:33:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-10"}

Central\nquestions on cell adhesion concern the binding affinity of these\nmembrane-anchored molecules, the mechanisms leading to the receptor-ligand\ndomains observed during adhesion, and the role of cytoskeletal and other active\nprocesses. In this review, these questions are addressed from a theoretical\nperspective. We focus on models in which the membranes are described as elastic\nsheets, and the receptors and ligands as anchored molecules. In these models,\nthe thermal membrane roughness on the nanometer scale leads to a cooperative\nbinding of anchored receptor and ligand molecules, since the receptor-ligand\nbinding smoothens out the membranes and facilitates the formation of additional\nbonds. Patterns of receptor domains observed in Monte Carlo simulations point\ntowards a joint role of spontaneous and active processes in cell adhesion. The\ninteractions mediated by the receptors and ligand molecules can be\ncharacterized by effective membrane adhesion potentials that depend on the\nconcentrations and binding energies of the molecules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2009 09:40:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-10"}

However, in many practical scenarios, only a noisy estimate\nof the channel is available, which may strongly differ from the true channel.\nThis imperfect CSI scenario is addressed by introducing the notion of\nestimation-induced outage (EIO) capacity. We derive a single-letter\ncharacterization of the maximal EIO rate and prove an associated coding theorem\nand its strong converse for discrete memoryless channels (DMCs). The\ntransmitter and the receiver rely on the channel estimate and the statistics of\nthe estimate to construct codes that guarantee reliable communication with a\ncertain outage probability. This ensures that in the non-outage case the\ntransmission meets the target rate with small error probability, irrespective\nof the quality of the channel estimate. Applications of the EIO capacity to a\nsingle-antenna (non-ergodic) Ricean fading channel are considered. The EIO\ncapacity for this case is compared to the EIO rates of a communication system\nin which the receiver decodes by using a mismatched ML decoder.

The\napproach is based on the assumption of local homogeneity: for every time point,\nthere exists a historical interval of homogeneity, in which the volatility\nparameter can be well approximated by a constant. The proposed procedure\nrecovers this interval from the data using the local change point (LCP)\nanalysis. Afterward, the estimate of the volatility can be simply obtained by\nlocal averaging. The approach carefully addresses the question of choosing the\ntuning parameters of the procedure using the so-called ``propagation''\ncondition.

Then, the new procedure is applied to some data\nsets and a comparison with a standard GARCH model is also provided. Finally, we\ndiscuss applications of the new method to the Value at Risk problem.

A separate strand of the literature has\npursued the possibility of an alternate, purely algebraic, polynomial-time\napproximation scheme. These schemes work by replacing each 1 with a random\nelement of an algebra A, and considering the determinant of the resulting\nmatrix. When A is noncommutative, this determinant can be defined in several\nways. We show that for estimators based on the conventional determinant, the\ncritical ratio of the second moment to the square of the first--and therefore\nthe number of trials we need to obtain a good estimate of the permanent--is (1\n+ O(1/d))^n when A is the algebra of d by d matrices. These results can be\nextended to group algebras, and semi-simple algebras in general. We also study\nthe symmetrized determinant of Barvinok, showing that the resulting estimator\nhas small variance when d is large enough. However, for constant d--the only\ncase in which an efficient algorithm is known--we show that the critical ratio\nexceeds 2^{n} / n^{O(d)}. Thus our results do not provide a new polynomial-time\napproximation scheme for the permanent. Indeed, they suggest that the algebraic\napproach to approximating the permanent faces significant obstacles.\n  We obtain these results using diagrammatic techniques in which we express\nmatrix products as contractions of tensor products. When these matrices are\nrandom, in either the Haar measure or the Gaussian measure, we can evaluate the\ntrace of these products in terms of the cycle structure of a suitably random\npermutation. In the symmetrized case, our estimates are then derived by a\nconnection with the character theory of the symmetric group.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2009 11:55:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-10"}

We demonstrate here that if this\nis done with typical weighted least-squares methods the result is a bias of\nrelative size between -2/n and +1/n on the value of the fitted diffusion\ncoefficient. Here n is the number of power-spectra averaged over, so typical\ncalibrations contain 10-20% bias. Both the sign and the size of the bias\ndepends on the weighting scheme applied. Hence, so do length-scale calibrations\nbased on the diffusion coefficient. The fitted value for the characteristic\nfrequency is not affected by this bias. For the AFM then, force measurements\nare not affected provided an independent length-scale calibration is available.\nFor optical-tweezers there is no such luck, since the spring constant is found\nas the ratio of the characteristic frequency and the diffusion coefficient.

For\ninstance, the self-diffusion coefficient and the shear viscosity are predicted\nwith average deviations of less 8% for the pure alcohols and 12% for the\nmixture. The predicted thermal conductivity agrees in average within 5% with\nthe experimental data. Additionally, some velocity and shear viscosity\nautocorrelation functions are presented and discussed. Radial distribution\nfunctions for ethanol are also presented. The predicted excess volume, excess\nenthalpy and the vapor-liquid equilibrium of the binary mixture methanol +\nethanol are assessed and the vapor-liquid equilibrium agree well with\nexperimental data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2009 13:02:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-10"}

We investigate star-planet interaction in the framework of a\nmagnetic field model of a stellar corona, considering the interaction between\nthe coronal field and that of a planetary magnetosphere moving through the\ncorona. The energy budget of the star-planet interaction is discussed assuming\nthat the planet may trigger a release of the energy of the coronal field by\ndecreasing its relative helicity. The observed intermittent character of the\nstar-planet interaction is explained by a topological change of the stellar\ncoronal field, induced by a variation of its relative helicity. The model\npredicts the formation of many prominence-like structures in the case of highly\nactive stars owing to the accumulation of matter evaporated from the planet\ninside an azimuthal flux rope in the outer corona. Moreover, the model can\nexplain why stars accompanied by close-in planets have a higher X-ray\nluminosity than those with distant planets. It predicts that the best\nconditions to detect radio emission from the exoplanets and their host stars\nare achieved when the field topology is characterized by field lines connected\nto the surface of the star, leading to a chromospheric hot spot rotating\nsynchronously with the planet. The main predictions of the model can be\nverified with present observational techniques, by a simultaneous monitoring of\nthe chromospheric flux and X-ray (or radio) emission, and spectropolarimetric\nobservations of the photospheric magnetic fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2009 14:17:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

We computed chromospheric models for the stars in the sample, in most\ncases in two different moments of activity.

We also computed in detail the net radiative losses for each model to\nconstrain the heating mechanism that can maintain the structure in the\natmosphere.

Applying a new\ntechnique that was developed by this group and recently reported, single wire\nand wire array samples of gold (Au) and silver (Ag) with small diameters 400nm\n< D < 3 mum and high aspect ratios <= 75000 in photonic crystal fibers and\nsingle hole capillaries are fabricated. Additionally, effective bulk metal\nwires of Au and Ag are created by a hybrid technique, including fiber tapering\nand magnetron sputter deposition for a large number of different diameters\nbetween 13 mum to 50 mum.\n  The measurement of the absorption, corresponding to the excitation of SPP\nmodes is realized with a new goniometer-based experimental setup for oblique\nincidence laser beam scattering at a single wavelength. A device is developed\nthat allows a simultaneous measurement of the scattering amplitude in s- and\np-polarization under varied incident angle.\n  For comparison, a model for the dispersion of discrete SPP modes and their\nangles of excitation is derived. The computed results are for the first time\ncompared with a theoretical approach to electromagnetic scattering theory for\ncylinders, that is calculated analogue to Mie scattering and to an exact\nsolution of Maxwell's equations for cylindrical SPP. The validity of the model\nis proved for higher incident angles. The first oblique incidence examination\nof SPP on metal wires for this size range is reported. The experimental results\nfor low incident angles show good accordance to the numerical results from\nscattering theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2009 00:53:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-30"}
