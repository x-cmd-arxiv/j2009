However, a rare subset show hot excess from within a few\nAU, which is often inferred to be transient. We examine 2 such sources to place\nlimits on their location to help distinguish between different interpretations\nfor their origin. We use MIDI on the VLTI to observe the debris discs around\neta Corvi and HD69830 using baseline lengths from 44-130m. New VISIR\nobservations of HD69830 at 18.7um are also presented. These observations are\ncompared with disc models to place limits on disc size. The visibility\nfunctions measured with MIDI for both sources show significant variation with\nwavelength across 8-13um in a manner consistent with the disc flux being well\nresolved, notably with a dip at 10-11.5um due to the silicate emission feature.\nThe average ratio of visibilities measured between 10-11.5um and 8-9um is\n0.934+/-0.015 for HD69830 and 0.880+/-0.013 for eta Corvi over the 4 baselines\nfor each source, a departure of 4 and 9sigma from that expected if the discs\nwere unresolved. HD69830 is unresolved by VISIR at 18.7um. The combined limits\nfrom MIDI and 8m imaging constrain the warm dust to lie within 0.05-2.4AU for\nHD69830 and 0.16-2.98AU for eta Corvi. These results represent the first\nresolution in the mid-IR of dust around main sequence stars. The constraints\nplaced on the location of the dust are consistent with radii predicted by SED\nmodelling. Tentative evidence for a common position angle for the dust at 1.7AU\nwith that at 150AU around eta Corvi, which might be expected if the hot dust is\nfed from the outer disc, demonstrates the potential of this technique for\nconstraining the origin of the dust and more generally for the study of dust in\nthe terrestrial regions of main sequence stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jun 2009 16:09:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

A very intense emission line at 1 keV, three broad emission\nfeatures at 2.63, 3.32, 3.9 keV and a broader emission feature in the Fe-Kalpha\nregion are present in the residuals. The broad emission features above 2 keV\ncan be equivalently well fitted with Gaussian profiles or relativistic smeared\nlines (diskline in XSPEC). The Fe-Kalpha feature is better fitted using a\ndiskline component at 6.76 keV or two diskline components at 6.7 and 6.97 keV,\nrespectively. The emission features are interpreted as resonant transitions of\nS xvi, Ar xviii, Ca xix, and highly ionized iron.

Wannier-like\nfunctions for the correlated shell are constructed by projecting local orbitals\nonto a set of Bloch eigenstates located within a certain energy window. The\nscreened Coulomb interaction and Hund's coupling are calculated from a\nfirst-principle constrained RPA scheme. We apply this LDA+DMFT implementation,\nin conjunction with continuous-time quantum Monte-Carlo, to study the\nelectronic correlations in LaFeAsO. Our findings support the physical picture\nof a metal with intermediate correlations. The average value of the mass\nrenormalization of the Fe 3d bands is about 1.6, in reasonable agreement with\nthe picture inferred from photoemission experiments. The discrepancies between\ndifferent LDA+DMFT calculations (all technically correct) which have been\nreported in the literature are shown to have two causes: i) the specific value\nof the interaction parameters used in these calculations and ii) the degree of\nlocalization of the Wannier orbitals chosen to represent the Fe 3d states, to\nwhich many-body terms are applied. The latter is a fundamental issue in the\napplication of many-body calculations, such as DMFT, in a realistic setting. We\nprovide strong evidence that the DMFT approximation is more accurate and more\nstraightforward to implement when well-localized orbitals are constructed from\na large energy window encompassing Fe-3d, As-4p and O-2p, and point out several\ndifficulties associated with the use of extended Wannier functions associated\nwith the low-energy iron bands.

We describe a method for easily converting the results of n-body\nplanetesimal simulations into observational properties (assuming black-body\ngrains and a single size distribution) and further modify this method to\nimprove its realism (using realistic grain properties and a three-phase size\ndistribution). We compare our results with observed debris discs and evaluate\nthe plausibility of detecting an LHB-like process in extrasolar systems. Recent\nsurveys have shown that 4% of stars exhibit 24 um excess and 16% exhibit 70 um\nexcess. We show that the Solar System would have been amongst the brightest of\nthese systems before the LHB at both 24 and 70 um. We find a significant\nincrease in 24 um emission during the LHB, which rapidly drops off and becomes\nundetectable within 30 Myr, whereas the 70 um emission remains detectable until\n360 Myr after the LHB. Comparison with the statistics of debris disc evolution\nshows that such depletion events must be rare occurring around less than 12% of\nSun-like stars and with this level of incidence we would expect approximately 1\nof the 413 Sun-like, field stars so far detected to have a 24 um excess to be\ncurrently going through an LHB.

In this analysis, we carried out a\ndetailed mapping of the correlation patterns using high-statistics RUN8 d+Au\nminimum bias data. A striking scaling behavior of the jet pair yields is\nobserved at low and intermediate $p_T$. The jet pair yields are found to be\nenhanced relative to $N_{\\rm coll}$ scaled p+p jet pair yields. The nuclear\nmodification factor for jet pair yields, $J_{\\rm dAu}$, seems to scale with\n$p_T^{\\rm sum}$= $p_T^a+p_T^b$ (scaler sum), and shows a characteristic\nCronin-like enhancement at $p_T^{\\rm sum}<$5-7GeV/c.
