Within r=200 h-1 kpc, the X-ray mass estimate is systematically lower\nthan that of lensing by 30-50%. At r>200 h-1 kpc, the mass density profiles\nfrom X-ray and weak lensing methods give consistent results. The most recent\nweak lensing work suggest a steeper profile than what is found from the X-ray\nanalysis, while still in agreement with the mass at large radii. Previous\nstudies have suggested that cooler small-scale structures can bias X-ray\ntemperature measurements or that the northern part of the cluster is disturbed.\nWe find these scenarios unlikely to resolve the central mass discrepancy since\nthe former requires 70-90% of the space to be occupied by these cool structures\nand excluding the northern substructure does not significantly affect the total\nmass profiles. A more plausible explanation is a projection effect. We also\nfind that the previously reported high hard-band to broad-band temperature\nratio in A1689, and many other clusters observed with Chandra, may be resulting\nfrom the instrumental absorption that decreases 10-15% of the effective area at\n~1.75 keV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2009 18:24:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

We use the restricted 2PN waveforms including the effects of\nspins.

Here we revisit this\nsignal within the context of supersymmetry and evaluate the parameter space of\nthe Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. We find that over much\nof the supersymmetric parameter space the lightest neutralino is predicted to\npossess the properties required to generate the WMAP Haze.

Most interesting decision problems, however, do not come with\na state space and an outcome space. Indeed, in complex problems it is often far\nfrom clear what the state and outcome spaces would be. We present an\nalternative foundation for decision making, in which the primitive objects of\nchoice are syntactic programs. A representation theorem is proved in the spirit\nof standard representation theorems, showing that if the DM's preference\nrelation on objects of choice satisfies appropriate axioms, then there exist a\nset S of states, a set O of outcomes, a way of interpreting the objects of\nchoice as functions from S to O, a probability on S, and a utility function on\nO, such that the DM prefers choice a to choice b if and only if the expected\nutility of a is higher than that of b. Thus, the state space and outcome space\nare subjective, just like the probability and utility; they are not part of the\ndescription of the problem. In principle, a modeler can test for SEU behavior\nwithout having access to states or outcomes. We illustrate the power of our\napproach by showing that it can capture decision makers who are subject to\nframing effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2009 18:22:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2021 16:28:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-07"}

Recently, Rabus and coworkers' analysis of HST observations lead them\nto claim brightening anomalies during transit might be caused by either a\nsecond transiting planet or a cool starspot. Observations of two consecutive\ntransits are presented here from the University of Arizona's 61-inch Kuiper\nTelescope on May 12 and May 15, 2008 UT. A 5.4 +/- 1.7 mmag (0.54 +/- 0.17%)\nbrightening anomaly was detected during the first half of the transit on May 12\nand again in the second half of the transit on May 15th. We conclude that this\nis a tentative detection of a r greater than or equal to 6 earth radii starspot\nrotating on the surface of the star. We suggest that all evidence to date\nsuggest TrES-1 has a spotty surface and there is no need to introduce a second\ntransiting planet in this system to explain these anomalies. We are only able\nto constrain the rotational period of the star to 40.2 +22.9 -14.6 days, due to\nprevious errors in measuring the alignment of the stellar spin axis with the\nplanetary orbital axis. This is consistent with the previously observed P_obs =\n33.2 +22.3 -14.3 day period.

Next, we consider the most canonical example of the abstract\ntheory, in which the Hilbert complex is the de Rham complex of a domain in\nEuclidean space. We use the Koszul complex to construct two families of finite\nelement differential forms, show that these can be arranged in subcomplexes of\nthe de Rham complex in numerous ways, and for each construct a bounded cochain\nprojection.

In this paper we present the observations, the\ncalibration techniques, and the resulting catalog. We show the derived CMD of\nthe population and discuss the completeness of our photometry. We define a\nspectro-photometric TiO index from the fluxes in V, I, and TiO-band. We find a\ncorrelation between the index and the spectral type valid for M-type stars,\nthat is accurate to better than 1 spectral sub-class for M3-M6 types and better\nthan 2 spectral subclasses for M0-M2 types. This allows us to newly classify\n217 stars. We subtract from our Halpha photometry the photospheric continuum at\nits wavelength, deriving calibrated line excess for the full sample. This\nrepresents the largest Halpha star catalog obtained to date on the ONC.

Nature seems to provide a pathway\nfor the formation of these exotic binaries, and a number of key questions need\nto be addressed: How do massive black holes pair in a merger? Depending on the\nproperties of the underlying galaxies, do black holes always form a close\nKeplerian binary? If a binary forms, does hardening proceed down to the domain\ncontrolled by gravitational wave back reaction? What is the role played by gas\nand/or stars in braking the black holes, and on which timescale does\ncoalescence occur? Can the black holes accrete on flight and shine during their\npathway to coalescence?

Our results suggest\nthat boost factors of the order of 10^2 are ruled out at more than 14 sigma.

However, the structural properties of asteroids\nhave been modified considerably since their formation. Thus, we can find among\nthem a great variety of physical configurations and dynamical histories. In\nfact, with only a few possible exceptions, all asteroids have been modified or\ncompletely disrupted many times during the age of the Solar System.

The\nlifetime of gas around stars in the process of formation is limited to a few\nmillion years based on astronomical observations, while isotopic dating of\nmeteorites and the Earth-Moon system suggest that perhaps 50-100 million years\nwere required for the assembly of the Earth. Therefore, much of the growth of\nthe terrestrial planets in our own system is presumed to have taken place under\nlargely gas-free conditions, and the physics of terrestrial planet formation is\ndominated by gravitational interactions and collisions. The earliest phase of\nterrestrial-planet formation involve the growth of km-sized or larger\nplanetesimals from dust grains, followed by the accumulations of these\nplanetesimals into ~100 lunar- to Mars-mass bodies that are initially\ngravitationally isolated from one-another in a swarm of smaller planetesimals,\nbut eventually grow to the point of significantly perturbing one-another. The\nmutual perturbations between the embryos, combined with gravitational stirring\nby Jupiter, lead to orbital crossings and collisions that drive the growth to\nEarth-sized planets on a timescale of 10-100 million years.

As a step toward ab initio\npressure studies for realistic systems within a setup of maximally localized\nWannier functions and the constrained random phase approximation, we examine in\nthis paper the paradigmatic pressure dependence of Coulomb interactions. While\ncompression commonly causes the \"extension\" of Wannier functions, and thus\ntransfer elements, to grow, we find the -- seemingly counter-intuitive --\ntendency that the bare Coulomb interaction increases under compression as well.\nWe reconcile these behaviors by appealing to a semi-analytical tight-binding\nmodel. We moreover argue that, for this model, the requirement of maximal\nWannier localization is equivalent to maximizing the Coulomb interaction matrix\nelements. We then apply the above first principles techniques to fcc hydrogen\nunder pressure.

Detailed knowledge\nof the physical mechanisms that govern stellar birth is a prerequisite for\nunderstanding the formation and evolution of our galactic home, the Milky Way.\nA theory of star formation is an essential part of any model for the origin of\nour solar system and of planets around other stars. Despite this pivotal\nimportance, and despite many decades of research, our understanding of the\nprocesses that initiate and regulate star formation is still limited.\n  Stars are born in cold interstellar clouds of molecular hydrogen gas. Star\nformation in these clouds is governed by the complex interplay between the\ngravitational attraction in the gas and agents such as turbulence, magnetic\nfields, radiation and thermal pressure that resist compression. The competition\nbetween these processes determines both the locations at which young stars form\nand how much mass they ultimately accrete. It plays out over many orders of\nmagnitude in space and time, ranging from galactic to stellar scales. In\naddition, star formation is a highly stochastic process in which rare and\nhard-to-predict events, such as the formation of very massive stars and the\nresulting feedback, can play a dominant role in determining the evolution of a\nstar-forming cloud.\n  As a consequence of the wide range of scales and processes that control star\nformation, analytic models are usually restricted to highly idealized cases.\nThese can yield insight, but the complexity of the problem means that they must\nbe used in concert with large-scale numerical simulations. Here we summarize\nthe state of modern star formation theory and review the recent advances in\nnumerical simulation techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jun 2009 11:40:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-07"}

However, there are two shortcomings\nwith current taint analysis based techniques. First, these techniques cause\napplication slowdown by about 76% thereby limiting their practicality. Second,\nthese techniques cannot handle non-control data attacks i.e., attacks that do\nnot overwrite control data such as return address, but instead overwrite\ncritical application configuration data or user identity data. In this work, to\naddress these problems, we describe a coarse-grained taint analysis technique\nthat uses information flow tracking at the level of application data objects.\nWe propagate a one-bit taint over each application object that is modified by\nuntrusted data thereby reducing the taint management overhead considerably. We\nperformed extensive experimental evaluation of our approach and show that it\ncan detect all critical attacks such as buffer overflows, and format string\nattacks, including non-control data attacks. Unlike the currently known\napproaches that can detect such a wide range of attacks, our approach does not\nrequire the source code or any hardware extensions. Run-time performance\noverhead evaluation shows that, on an average, our approach causes application\nslowdown by only 37% which is an order of magnitude improvement over existing\napproaches. Finally, since our approach performs run-time binary\ninstrumentation, it is easier to integrate it with existing applications and\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jun 2009 14:07:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2009 07:18:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

A map of the surface density of galaxies at z=1.6 in the GMASS\nfield shows that its structure is irregular. The differences in the physical\nproperties of Cl 0332-2742 member and field galaxies agree with the latest\nhierarchical galaxy formation models: for overdensity members, the star\nformation rate (SFR), and specific SFR, is approximately 50% lower than for the\nfield galaxies; overdensity galaxies are twice the age, on average, of field\ngalaxies; and there is a higher proportion of both massive (M>10^{10.7} M_sol),\nand early-type galaxies, inside Cl 0332-2742 than in the field. Among the 42\nmembers, 7 have spectra consistent with being passively evolving, massive\ngalaxies.

We show that\nthe cloaking device performs remarkably well even in a regime beyond\ngeometrical optics where the device is comparable in size with the wavelength.\nIn particular, the cloak is nearly perfect for a spectrum of frequencies that\nare related to spherical harmonics. We also show that for increasing wavenumber\nthe device works increasingly better, approaching perfect behavior in the limit\nof geometrical optics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jun 2009 14:44:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-16"}

We study\nthe nucleosynthesis in the helium convective zone with 13C formed from mixed\nprotons as neutron source by using a nuclear network from H through S. In the\nabsence or scarcity of the pristine metals, the neutron-recycling reactions,\n12C(n,g)13C(a,n)16O and also 16O(n,g)17O(a,n)20Ne promote the synthesis of O\nand light elements, including their neutron-rich isotopes and the odd atomic\nnumber elements.

We argue that these three stars\nwere born as the low-mass members of Pop. III binaries and later subject to the\nsurface pollution by the mass transfer in the binary systems. It is also shown\nthat the AGB nucleosynthesis with hydrogen mixing explains the abundances of C,\nO, Na, Mg and Al observed for most of carbon-enhanced EMP (CEMP) stars,\nincluding all CEMP-s stars with s-process elements.
