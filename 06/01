The metric on the group is left-invariant\nbut not right-invariant. We will reduce the geometry of such groups (using\ntechniques popularized by Milnor) to algebra on their tangent space. In\nparticular, the curvature can be expressed as a biquadratic form on the Lie\nalgebra.

Firstly, we consider the classical Gibbs\napproach for states and find that this formalism is ineffective for\nnon-equilibrium phenomena because it is based on a distribution of\nprobabilities indirectly. Secondly, we develop a path formalism which is\ndirectly based on the distribution of probabilities and therefore significantly\nsimplifies the analytical approach. The new formalism requires generalizing the\n'static', state quantities of a system, like entropy or free energy potential,\nto their path analogues. Also we obtain a path balance equation and an equation\nof equilibrium path. For the distribution of probabilities we obtain a\nfunctional dependence similar to the Feynman's path integral formalism of\naction, only now the role of a Hamiltonian is played by the state entropy. For\nthe production of the state free energy we illustrate a significant dependence\non the type of system's connectivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 May 2009 23:15:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2009 01:21:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 19 Jun 2009 04:44:24 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2009 19:50:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-24"}

In\nthis paper, it is suggested that the formation of blobs is a consequence of an\nintrinsic instability of coronal streamers occurring at a very localized region\naround the cusp. The evolutionary process of the instability, as revealed in\nour calculations, can be described as follows: (1) through the localized cusp\nregion where the field is too weak to sustain the confinement, plasmas expand\nand stretch the closed field lines radially outward as a result of the\nfreezing-in effect of plasma-magnetic field coupling; the expansion brings a\nstrong velocity gradient into the slow wind regime providing the free energy\nnecessary for the onset of a subsequent magnetohydrodynamic instability; (2)\nthe instability manifests itself mainly as mixed streaming sausage-kink modes,\nthe former results in pinches of elongated magnetic loops to provoke\nreconnections at one or many locations to form blobs. Then, the streamer system\nreturns to the configuration with a lower cusp point, subject to another cycle\nof streamer instability. Although the instability is intrinsic, it does not\nlead to the loss of the closed magnetic flux, neither does it affect the\noverall feature of a streamer. The main properties of the modeled blobs,\nincluding their size, velocity profiles, density contrasts, and even their\ndaily occurrence rate, are in line with available observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2009 01:05:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

One is a conflict at an exit when\npedestrians evacuate from a room. We use floor field model for simulating such\nbehavior, which is a well-studied pedestrian model using cellular automata. The\nconflicts have been taken into account by the friction parameter. However, the\nfriction parameter so far is a constant and does not depend on the number of\nthe pedestrians conflicting at the same time. Thus, we have improved the\nfriction parameter by the frictional function, which is a function of the\nnumber of the pedestrians involved in the conflict. Second, we have newly\nintroduced the cost of turning of pedestrians at the exit. Since pedestrians\nhave inertia, their walking speeds decrease when they turn, and the pedestrian\noutflow decreases.\n  The validity of the extended model, which includes the frictional function\nand the turning function, is verified by both a mean field theory and\nexperiments. In our experiments, the pedestrian flow increases when we put an\nobstacle in front of an exit. The analytical results clearly explains the\nmechanism of the effect of the obstacle, i.e., the obstacle blocks pedestrians\nmoving to the exit and decreases the average number of pedestrians involved in\nthe conflict. We have also found that an obstacle works more effectively when\nwe shift it from the center since pedestrians go through the exit with less\nturning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2009 09:31:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-18"}

The derived X-ray photon index and the flux density\nat 1 keV were found to be Gamma = 1.65 +- 0.02 and S_{1 keV} = 215 +- 5 nJy, in\nthe quiescent state. In the flaring state, the source exhibited a harder X-ray\nspectrum (Gamma = 1.50 +- 0.01) with a nearly doubled X-ray flux density S_{1\nkeV} = 404^{+6}_{-5} nJy. Moreover, significant hard X-ray signals were\ndetected up to ~ 27 keV. In cooperation with the Suzaku, simultaneous radio,\noptical, and very-high-energy gamma-ray observations were performed with the\nNobeyama Millimeter Array, the KANATA telescope, and the MAGIC telescope,\nrespectively. The radio and optical fluxes in the flaring state (3.04 +- 0.46\nJy and 8.93 +- 0.05 mJy at 86.75 Hz and in the V-band, respectively) were found\nto be higher by a factor of 2--3 than those in the quiescent state (1.73 +-\n0.26 Jy and 3.03 +- 0.01 mJy at 86.75 Hz and in the V-band, respectively). No\nnotable gamma-ray events were detected in either observation. The spectral\nenergy distribution indicated that the X-ray spectrum was dominated by inverse\nCompton radiation in both observations, while synchrotron radiation exhibited a\nspectral cutoff around the optical frequency. Furthermore, no significant\ndifference in the synchrotron cutoff frequency was found between the quiescent\nand flaring states. According to a simple synchrotron self-Compton model, the\nchange of the spectral energy distribution is due to an increase in the energy\ndensity of electrons with small changes of both the magnetic field strength and\nthe maximum Lorentz factor of electrons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2009 08:29:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Contrasted with the traditional\napproach of building networks in a \"flat\" structure using sensor devices of the\nsame capability, the hierarchical approach deploys devices of higher capability\nin a higher tier, i.e., a tier closer to the server. While query processing in\nflat sensor networks has been widely studied, the study on query processing in\nhierarchical sensor networks has been inadequate. In wireless sensor networks,\nthe main costs that should be considered are the energy for sending data and\nthe storage for storing queries. There is a trade-off between these two costs.\nBased on this, we first propose a progressive processing method that\neffectively processes a large number of continuous range queries in\nhierarchical sensor networks. The proposed method uses the query merging\ntechnique proposed by Xiang et al. as the basis and additionally considers the\ntrade-off between the two costs. More specifically, it works toward reducing\nthe storage cost at lower-tier nodes by merging more queries, and toward\nreducing the energy cost at higher-tier nodes by merging fewer queries (thereby\nreducing \"false alarms\"). We then present how to build a hierarchical sensor\nnetwork that is optimal with respect to the weighted sum of the two costs. It\nallows for a cost-based systematic control of the trade-off based on the\nrelative importance between the storage and energy in a given network\nenvironment and application. Experimental results show that the proposed method\nachieves a near-optimal control between the storage and energy and reduces the\ncost by 0.989~84.995 times compared with the cost achieved using the flat\n(i.e., non-hierarchical) setup as in the work by Xiang et al.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2009 11:04:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The first Theorem itself gives us a noteworthy bijection between maximal\npartial orderings of two rings by which one is a rational extension of the\nother. We characterize conditions when a Baer reduced ring can be integrally\nclosed in its total quotient ring. We prove that Baer hulls of rings have\nexactly one automorphism (the identity) and we even prove this for a general\ncase (Lemma 12).

We have obtained high\nsignal-to-noise ratio, long-slit spectra of 49 BCGs in the nearby Universe.\nHere, we derive Single Stellar Population (SSP)-equivalent ages, metallicities\nand alpha-abundance ratios in the centres of the galaxies using the Lick/IDS\nsystem of absorption line indices. We systematically compare the indices and\nderived parameters for the BCGs with those of large samples of ordinary\nelliptical galaxies in the same mass range. We find no significant differences\nbetween the index-velocity dispersion relations of the BCG data and those of\nnormal ellipticals, but we do find subtle differences between the derived\nSSP-parameters. The BCGs show, on average, higher metallicity ([Z/H]) and\nalpha-abundance ([E/Fe]) values. We analyse possible correlations between the\nderived parameters and the internal properties of the galaxies (velocity\ndispersion, rotation, luminosity) and those of the host clusters (density,\nmass, distance from BCG to X-ray peak, presence of cooling flows), with the aim\nof dissentangling if the BCG properties are more influenced by their internal\nor host cluster properties.

These classical models lend themselves to a simple\ninterpretation in which a single history (a single element of the sample space)\nis deemed to be 'real'; we require only that this real history should not be\nruled out by the dynamics, the axioms of which ensure that not all histories\nare precluded. However, applying this interpretation naively to quantum measure\ntheory we can find experimentally realisable systems (notably the\nPeres-Kochen-Specker system) in which every history is ruled out by the\ndynamics, challenging us to formulate a deeper realist framework.\n  Our first response is to hold on to our existing interpretative framework and\nattempt a revision of the dynamics that would reduce quantum measure theory to\na classical dynamics. We explore this approach by examining the histories\nformulation of a stochastic-collapse model on a simple (discrete) null-lattice,\nconcluding that the drawbacks of this approach outweigh the benefits.\n  Our second response is to abandon our classically inspired interpretation in\nfavour of Sorkin's 'co-events', a more general ontology that still allows for\nstrict realism.

We develop & evaluate various co-event schemes that have\nbeen suggested to date, finally adopting the multiplicative scheme; the current\nworking model of co-event theory and a promising interpretation of quantum\nmeasure theory, though still a work in progress.

We apply unsupervised classification algorithms to identify\nclusters of variable stars from modes of the probability density distribution.\nWe use reference variability databases (Hipparcos and OGLE) as a framework to\ncalibrate the clustering methodology.

We bound the\nregions of flavors and colors which can yield a physical infrared fixed point.\nAs a consistency check we recover the previously investigated conformal windows\nbounds when restricting to a single matter representation. The earlier\nconformal windows can be imagined to be part now of the new conformal house. We\npredict the nonperturbative anomalous dimensions at the infrared fixed points.\nWe further investigate the effects of adding mass terms to the condensates on\nthe conformal house chiral dynamics and construct the simplest instanton\ninduced effective Lagrangian terms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2009 15:46:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}
