Theory predicts that the critical state and, therefore,\nneuronal avalanches are optimal for input processing, but until now, this is\nuntested in experiments.

By changing the ratio of excitation\nand inhibition in the cultures, we derive a network tuning curve for stimulus\nprocessing as a function of distance from the critical state in agreement with\npredictions from our simulations.

The core of the method is to separate\nthe single-scattered echo of the target from the multiple scattering\nbackground. This is possible because of a deterministic coherence along the\nantidiagonals of the array response matrix, which is typical of single\nscattering.

It is also the first extrasolar giant planet (EGP) astrometrically\ndiscovered around a main-sequence star. The statistical significance of the\ndetection is shown in two ways. First, there is a 2 x 10^-8 probability that\nthe astrometric motion fits a parallax-and-proper-motion-only model. Second,\nperiodogram analysis shows a false alarm probability of 3 x 10^-5 that the\ndiscovered period is randomly generated. The planetary mass is M2 = 6.4\n(+2.6,-3.1) Jupiter-masses (MJ), and the orbital period is P = 0.744\n(+0.013,-0.008) yr in the most likely model. In less likely models, companion\nmasses that are higher than the 13 MJ planetary mass limit are ruled out by\npast radial velocity measurements unless the system radial velocity is more\nthan twice the current upper limits and the near-periastron orbital phase was\nnever observed. This new planetary system is remarkable, in part, because its\nstar, VB 10, is near the lower mass limit for a star. Our astrometric\nobservations provide a dynamical mass measurement and will in time allow us to\nconfront the theoretical models of formation and evolution of such systems and\ntheir members.

The Fermi Paradox leads some to conclude that humans have the only\nadvanced civilization in this galaxy, either because civilization formation is\nvery rare or because intelligent civilizations inevitably destroy themselves.\nIn this paper, we argue that this conclusion is premature by introducing the\n\"Sustainability Solution\" to the Fermi Paradox, which questions the Paradox's\nassumption of faster (e.g. exponential) civilization growth. Drawing on\ninsights from the sustainability of human civilization on Earth, we propose\nthat faster-growth may not be sustainable on the galactic scale.

In\nthe low velocity regime, 35-80 km/s, the warm dark matter simulation reproduces\nthe observed flattening of the velocity function. On the contrary, the\nsimulation with cold dark matter predicts a steep rise in the velocity function\ntowards lower velocities; for V_max=35 km/s, it forecasts ~10 times more\nsources than the ones observed. If confirmed by the complete ALFALFA survey,\nour results indicate a potential problem for the cold dark matter paradigm or\nfor the conventional assumptions about energetic feedback in dwarf galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2009 20:09:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-24"}

In chemical models assuming a spherically symmetric envelope, the\nvolume of gas irradiated by protostellar FUV radiation is very small due to the\nhigh extinction by dust. The abundance of CO+ is thus underpredicted by orders\nof magnitude. In a more realistic model, FUV photons can escape through an\noutflow region and irradiate gas at the border to the envelope. Thus, we\nintroduce the first 2D axi-symmetric chemical model of the envelope of a\nhigh-mass star forming region to explain the CO+ observations as a prototypical\nFUV tracer. The model assumes an axi-symmetric power-law density structure with\na cavity due to the outflow. The local FUV flux is calculated by a Monte Carlo\nradiative transfer code taking scattering on dust into account. A grid of\nprecalculated chemical abundances, introduced in the first part of this series\nof papers, is used to quickly interpolate chemical abundances. This approach\nallows to calculate the temperature structure of the FUV heated outflow walls\nself-consistently with the chemistry.\n  Synthetic maps of the line flux are calculated using a raytracer code.\nSingle-dish and interferometric observations are simulated and the model\nresults are compared to published and new JCMT and SMA observations. The\ntwo-dimensional model of AFGL 2591 is able to reproduce the JCMT single-dish\nobservations and also explains the non-detection by the SMA. We conclude that\nthe observed CO+ line flux and its narrow width can be interpreted by emission\nfrom the warm and dense outflow walls irradiated by protostellar FUV radiation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2009 07:13:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-22"}

The\nmodel is based on de Broglie's original electron wave-particle relativistic\ntheory, and on the observation that the Klein-Gordon equation governs the\npropagation mode of a common microwave waveguide - with the Schroedinger\nequation as a low group velocity approximation. This analogy opened for\npractical physical models, including solitons. In the linear case a conceived\ncorpuscle zigzags within the fictitious waveguide - a zigzagging that resembles\nPenrose's picture of Dirac's electron theory. The soliton envelope is defined\nby a special nonlinear version of the Schroedinger equation. The nonlinearity\ncancels the de Broglie/Bohm Quantum Potential of the envelope. The wavefunction\nis confined by the envelope, and thus the concept of the collapse of the\nwavefunction is eliminated.

The corpuscle,\nincorporating spin and charge, which moves at the speed of light, needs further\nstudy relating it to the photon. A model of the photon based on the mutual\ncoupling of two modes of an optical fiber at the Planck scale, is suggested.\nOne of these modes is thought to carry two orthogonal polarized electromagnetic\nexternal fields, while the other, internal, mode carries a corpuscle that moves\nhelically and thus represents the spin.

Here we combine the results from dynamical\nsimulations of star clusters in tidal fields with our evolutionary synthesis\ncode GALEV to extend the models by a new dimension: the total cluster\ndisruption time.

A first order\nphase transition involves a discontinuous jump in a some statistical variable\nof the system. The discontinuous property is called the order parameter. Each\nphase transitions has its own order parameter that range over a tremendous\nvariety of physical properties. These properties include the density of a\nliquid gas transition, the magnetization in a ferromagnet, the size of a\nconnected cluster in a percolation transition, and a condensate wave function\nin a superfluid or superconductor.

We also study the implications of the foreground subtraction.\nA major part of the thesis investigates the possibility of detecting ionized\nbubbles around individual sources in 21-cm maps. We present a visibility based\nmatched filter technique to optimally combine the signal from an ionized bubble\nand minimize the noise and foreground contributions. The formalism makes\ndefinite predictions on the ability to detect an ionized bubble or conclusively\nrule out its presence within a radio map. Results are presented for the GMRT\nand the MWA.

Correlation\nfunctions for the Bunch-Davies vacuum of such a theory have long been known to\nbe infrared divergent for a wide range of values of $\\epsilon$. We resolve\nthese divergences by explicitly matching the spacetime under consideration to a\nspacetime without infrared divergencies. Such a procedure ensures that all\ncorrelation functions with respect to the vacuum in the spacetime of interest\nare infrared finite. In this newly defined vacuum we construct the coincidence\nlimit of the propagator and as an example calculate the expectation value of\nthe stress energy tensor. We find that this approach gives both in the\nultraviolet and in the infrared satisfactory results. Moreover, we find that,\nunless the effective mass due to the coupling to the Ricci scalar $\\xi R$ is\nnegative, quantum contributions to the energy density always dilute away\nfaster, or just as fast, as the background energy density. Therefore, quantum\nbackreaction is insignificant at the one loop order, unless $\\xi R$ is\nnegative. Finally we compare this approach with known results where the\ninfrared is regulated by placing the Universe in a finite box. In an\naccelerating universe, the results are qualitatively the same, provided one\nidentifies the size of the Universe with the physical Hubble radius at the time\nof the matching. In a decelerating universe however, the two schemes give\ndifferent late time behavior for the quantum stress energy tensor. This happens\nbecause in this case the length scale at which one regulates the infrared\nbecomes sub-Hubble at late times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2009 09:29:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-05"}

In all these systems,\nconnection length distributions have very similar shapes, with an initial large\npeak and a long flat tail representing the admixture of long-distance\nconnections to mostly short-distance connections. Furthermore, not all\npotentially possible synapses are formed, and only a fraction of axons (called\nfilling fraction) establish synapses with spatially neighboring neurons. We\nexplored what aspects of these connectivity patterns can be explained simply by\nrandom axonal outgrowth. We found that random axonal growth away from the soma\ncan already reproduce the known distance distribution of connections. We also\nobserved that experimentally observed filling fractions can be generated by\ncompetition for available space at the target neurons--a model markedly\ndifferent from previous explanations.

Analysis of 17 months\nof continuous high-resolution observations reveal that these pristine crystals\nare frequently observed in ice falling from mid-level mixed-phase layer clouds\n(85% of the time for layers at -15C). Detailed analysis of a case study\nindicates that the crystals are nucleated and grow rapidly within the\nsupercooled layer, then fall out, forming well-defined layers of specular\nreflection. From the lidar alone the fraction of oriented crystals cannot be\nquantified, but polarimetric radar measurements confirmed that a substantial\nfraction of the crystal population was well oriented.

In order to constitute conclusive evidence, two conditions\nhave to be satisfied. First, strict separation of the measurement events in the\nsense of special relativity is required (\"locality loophole\"). Second, almost\nall entangled pairs have to be detected (for particles in a maximally entangled\nstate the required detector efficiency is 82.8%), which is hard to achieve\nexperimentally (\"detection loophole\"). By using the recently demonstrated\nentanglement between single trapped atoms and single photons it becomes\npossible to entangle two atoms at a large distance via entanglement swapping.\nCombining the high detection efficiency achieved with atoms with the space-like\nseparation of the atomic state detection events, both loopholes can be closed\nwithin the same experiment. In this paper we present estimations based on\ncurrent experimental achievements which show that such an experiment is\nfeasible in future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2009 13:38:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-20"}

The group content and\nidentification criteria were described in the first two papers of the series.\nIn this paper we report our spectroscopic and photometric observations of the\noptical counterpart of IRAS 00470+6429 obtained in 2003--2008. The optical\nspectrum is dominated by emission lines, most of which have P Cyg type\nprofiles. We detected significant brightness variations, which may include a\nregular component, and variable spectral line profiles in both shape and\nposition. The presence of a weak Li {\\sc I} 6708 \\AA line in the spectrum\nsuggests that the object is most likely a binary system with a B2--B3 spectral\ntype primary companion of a luminosity $\\log$ L/L$\\odot$ = 3.9$\\pm$0.3 and a\nlate-type secondary companion.

So far, the non-detection of excited nascent\nH2 in dense quiescent clouds could be a sign that either predictions of\nemission line intensities are not correct or the de-excitation of the newly\nformed molecules proceeds rapidly on the grain surface itself. In this letter\nwe present experimental evidence that interstellar molecular hydrogen is formed\nand then rapidly de-excited on the surface of porous water ice mantles. In\naddition, although we detect ro-vibrationally excited nascent molecules\ndesorbing from a bare non-porous (compact) water ice film, we demonstrate that\nthe amount of excited nascent hydrogen molecules is significantly reduced no\nmatter the morphology of the water ice substrate at 10 K (both on non-porous\nand on porous water ice) in a regime of high molecular coverage as is the case\nin dark molecular clouds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2009 14:29:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

SpiderPig's approach was found to be very\nfast and was transparent enough for reliable and usable data flow analysis. It\nwas created with the purpose of providing a tool which would aid vulnerability\nand security researchers with tracing and analyzing any necessary data and its\nfurther propagation through a program. At the current state it works on IA-32\nplatforms with Microsoft Windows systems and it supports FPU, SSE, MMX and all\nof the IA-32 general instructions. SpiderPig also demonstrates the usage of a\nvirtual code integration (VCI) framework which allows for modifying the target\napplication code at the instruction level. By this I mean that the VCI\nframework allows for custom code insertion, original code modification and full\ncustomization of the original application's code. Instructions can be swapped\nout, deleted or modified at a whim, without corrupting the surrounding code and\nside-effects of the modification are resolved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2009 14:32:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-04"}

In the context of a surface density profile motivated by\nsimilarity solutions for viscous accretion disks, the best-fit models for the\nsample disks have characteristic radii R_c = 20-200 AU, high disk masses M_d =\n0.005-0.14 M_sun, and a narrow range of radial surface density gradients around\na median $\\gamma$ = 0.9.
