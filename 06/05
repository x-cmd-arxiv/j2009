In multi path time varying environments, it is\nnecessary to estimate time-shifts, scale-shifts (the wideband equivalent of\nDoppler-shifts), and the gains/phases of each of the multiple paths. With\nrecent advances in sparse estimation (or \"compressive sensing\"), new estimation\ntechniques have emerged which yield more accurate estimates of these channel\nparameters than traditional strategies. These estimation strategies, however,\nrestrict potential estimates of time-shifts and scale-shifts to a finite set of\nvalues separated by a choice of grid spacing. A small grid spacing increases\nthe number of potential estimates, thus lowering the quantization error, but\nalso increases complexity and estimation time. Conversely, a large grid spacing\nlowers the number of potential estimates, thus lowering the complexity and\nestimation time, but increases the quantization error. In this thesis, we\nderive an expression which relates the choice of grid spacing to the\nmean-squared quantization error. Furthermore, we consider the case when\nscale-shifts are approximated by Doppler-shifts, and derive a similar\nexpression relating the choice of the grid spacing and the quantization error.\nUsing insights gained from these expressions, we further explore the effects of\nthe choice and grid spacing, and examine when a wideband model can be well\napproximated by a narrowband model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2009 19:45:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-05"}

Allowing all\ndynamical variables to interact with each other in a self-consistent manner\nthis formalism ensures that all the dynamical quantities involved are conserved\non the background spacetime and obey the gauge invariance under general\ncoordinate transformations that preserve the background geometry. Because it is\nbased on a generalized perturbation theory and the important new emphasis is on\nthe self-consistency of all the dynamical variables involved we call it a\ngravitational perturbation theory with self-consistent backreaction (GP-SCB).\n  As an illustration of how this formalism is implemented we construct\nperturbatively a self-consistent set of equations of motion for an inspiraling\ngravitational binary, which does not require extra assumptions such as slow\nmotion, weak-field or small mass ratio for its formulation. This case should\nencompass the inspiral and possibly the plunge and merger phases of binaries\nwith otherwise general parameters (e.g., mass ratio and relative velocity)\nthough more investigation is needed to substantiate it.\n  In the second part, we discuss how the mass ratio can be treated as a\nperturbation parameter in the post-Newtonian effective field theory (PN-EFT)\napproach, thus extending the work of Goldberger and Rothstein for equal mass\nbinaries to variable mass ratios. We provide rough estimates for the higher\npost-Newtonian orders needed to determine the number of gravitational wave\ncycles, with a specified precision, that fall into a detector's bandwidth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2009 19:34:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-05"}

The refrigerator is based on an Otto cycle where the working medium is an\ninteracting spin system with an energy gap. For this system the external\ncontrol Hamiltonian does not commute with the internal interaction. As a result\nduring the demagnetization and magnetization segments of the operating cycle\nthe system cannot follow adiabatically the temporal change in the energy\nlevels. We connect the nonadiabatic dynamics to quantum friction. An adiabatic\nmeasure is defined characterizing the rate of change of the Hamiltonian. Closed\nform solutions are found for a constant adiabatic measure for all the cycle\nsegments. We have identified a family of quantized frictionless cycles with\nincreasing cycle times. These cycles minimize the entropy production. Such\nfrictionless cycles are able to cool to $T_c=0$. External noise on the controls\neliminates these frictionless cycles. The influence of phase and amplitude\nnoise on the demagnetization and magnetization segments is explicitly derived.\nAn extensive numerical study of optimal cooling cycles was carried out which\nshowed that at sufficiently low temperature the noise always dominates\nrestricting the minimum temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2009 20:03:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2009 16:01:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-08"}

In this paper we apply a\nspecific approach to spectral connectivity analysis (SCA; Lee & Wasserman 2009)\ncalled diffusion map. SCA is a class of non-linear techniques for transforming\nobserved data (e.g., photometric colours for each galaxy, where the data lie on\na complex subset of p-dimensional space) to a simpler, more natural coordinate\nsystem wherein we apply regression to make redshift predictions. As SCA relies\nupon eigen-decomposition, our training set size is limited to ~ 10,000\ngalaxies; we use the Nystrom extension to quickly estimate diffusion\ncoordinates for objects not in the training set. We apply our method to 350,738\nSDSS main sample galaxies, 29,816 SDSS luminous red galaxies, and 5,223\ngalaxies from DEEP2 with CFHTLS ugriz photometry. For all three datasets, we\nachieve prediction accuracies on par with previous analyses, and find that use\nof the Nystrom extension leads to a negligible loss of prediction accuracy\nrelative to that achieved with the training sets. As in some previous analyses\n(e.g., Collister & Lahav 2004, Ball et al. 2008), we observe that our\npredictions are generally too high (low) in the low (high) redshift regimes. We\ndemonstrate that this is a manifestation of attenuation bias, wherein\nmeasurement error (i.e., uncertainty in diffusion coordinates due to\nuncertainty in the measured fluxes/magnitudes) reduces the slope of the\nbest-fit regression line. Mitigation of this bias is necessary if we are to use\nphotometric redshift estimates produced by computationally efficient empirical\nmethods in precision cosmology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2009 20:31:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

In addition, we\nhave improved our modeling of the instrument beams and have reduced our\nabsolute calibration uncertainty from 5% to 3.5% in temperature. The robustness\nof our results is confirmed through extensive jackknife tests and by way of the\nagreement we find between our two fully independent analysis pipelines. For the\nstandard 6-parameter LCDM model, the addition of QUaD data marginally improves\nthe constraints on a number of cosmological parameters over those obtained from\nthe WMAP experiment alone. The impact of QUaD data is significantly greater for\na model extended to include either a running in the scalar spectral index, or a\npossible tensor component, or both. Adding both the QUaD data and the results\nfrom the ACBAR experiment, the uncertainty in the spectral index running is\nreduced by ~25% compared to WMAP alone, while the upper limit on the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio is reduced from r < 0.48 to r < 0.33 (95% c.l). This is\nthe strongest limit on tensors to date from the CMB alone.

(2) The observed upper limit for the NCRI fraction (NCRIf) of about 20%,\nin disordered samples, is more-or-less the same as the already predicted upper\nlimit for the superfluid fraction of a well-ordered crystal; we argue that this\nmay not be a coincidence. (3) The negative experimental evidence for a second\npropagating hydrodynamic mode (expected to be fourth sound-like) may be due to\nthe long relaxation times $\\tau$ at low temperature $T$; only for frequencies\nsatisfying $\\omega\\tau\\ll1$ does the hydrodynamic theory apply. (4) The\nfundamental principles of quantum mechanics imply that Bose-Einstein\ncondensation is not necessary to define a quantum-mechanical phase; therefore\nthe absence of a finite condensate fraction $f_{0}$ does not necessarily imply\nthe absence of superfluidity. (5) Just as vortices should avoid occupied\nlattice sites to provide a vortex-lattice interaction, the lattice should\ninteract with the vortices to provide a lattice-vortex interaction; thus\ndislocations should interact with vortices, whose motion is affected by\nrotation. We discuss some experimental implications for the vortex liquid\nmodel, shear response, hysteresis, and relaxation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2009 23:36:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-08"}

We use a steepest-descent approach\nto point out that exact results can be obtained for the high-mass tail of the\nhalo mass function and the two-point correlation of massive halos. Focusing on\nprimordial non-Gaussianity of the local type, we check that these results agree\nwith numerical simulations. The high-mass cutoff of the halo mass function\ntakes the same form as the one obtained from the Press-Schechter formalism, but\nwith a linear threshold $\\delta_L$ that depends on the definition of the halo.\nWe show that a simple formula, which obeys this high-mass asymptotic and uses\nthe fit obtained for Gaussian initial conditions, matches numerical simulations\nwhile keeping the mass function normalized to unity. Next, by deriving the\nreal-space halo two-point correlation in the spirit of Kaiser (1984) and taking\na Fourier transform, we obtain good agreement with simulations for the\ncorrection to the halo bias due to primordial non-Gaussianity. Therefore,\nneither the halo mass function nor the bias require an ad-hoc parameter $q$\nprovided one uses the correct linear threshold $\\delta_L$ and pays attention to\nhalo displacements. The nonlinear real-space expression can be useful for\nchecking that the \"linearized\" bias is a valid approximation. Moreover, it\nclearly shows how the baryon acoustic oscillation at $\\sim 100 h^{-1}$Mpc is\namplified by the bias of massive halos and modified by primordial\nnon-Gaussianity. On smaller scales, the correction to the real-space bias\nroughly scales as $\\fNL \\, b_M(\\fNL=0) \\, x^2$. The low-$k$ behavior of the\nhalo bias does not imply a divergent real-space correlation, so that one does\nnot need to introduce counterterms that depend on the survey size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jun 2009 07:00:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Feb 2011 07:53:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Using a Monte Carlo approach, we select the\nphysical parameters of the binary lens system, a star hosting a planet, and we\ncalculate the pixel-lensing light curve taking into account the finite source\neffects. Indeed, their inclusion is crucial since the sources in M31\nmicrolensing events are mainly giant stars. Light curves with detectable\nplanetary features are selected by looking for significant deviations from the\ncorresponding Paczy\\'{n}ski shapes. We find that the time scale of planetary\ndeviations in light curves increase (up to 3-4 days) as the source size\nincreases. This means that only few exposures per day, depending also on the\nrequired accuracy, may be sufficient to reveal in the light curve a planetary\ncompanion. Although the mean planet mass for the selected events is about $2\nM_{\\rm {Jupiter}}$, even small mass planets ($M_{\\rm P} < 20 M_{\\oplus}$) can\ncause significant deviations, at least in the observations with large\ntelescopes. However, even in the former case, the probability to find\ndetectable planetary features in pixel-lensing light curves is at most a few\npercent of the detectable events, and therefore many events have to be\ncollected in order to detect an extrasolar planet in M31.

The data, combined\nwith the polarization spectrum taken at 6 days before the second maximum (Maund\net al. 2007a), enable us to closely examine the intrinsic properties of the SN.\nThe polarization percentage is smaller at the later epoch over a wide\nwavelength range, while the position angle is similar at the two epochs. We\nfind that an assumption of complete depolarization of strong lines at the\nemission peak is not necessarily correct. The intrinsic polarization of the SN\nis larger, and thus, the ejecta of SN 2005bf would be more asymmetric than\npreviously expected. The axis ratio of the photosphere projected on the sky\ndeviates from unity by at least 20 %. If the position angle of interstellar\npolarization is aligned with the spiral arm of the host galaxy, the deviation\nis larger than 25 %. The line polarization at the He I, Ca II and Fe II lines\nis also smaller at the later epoch. The changes in the position angle across\nthese lines, which were observed at the earlier epoch, are still marginally\npresent at the later epoch. The similar polarimetric behavior suggests that the\ndistributions of these ions are correlated. Properties of polarization, as well\nas the light curve and the spectra both at photospheric and nebular phases, can\nbe explained by an aspherical, possibly unipolar explosion of a WN star in\nwhich the blob of 56Ni penetrates C+O core and stops within the He layer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jun 2009 08:42:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

The ferroelectric polarization of MnWO4 in the spiral-spin\nstate AF2 was examined by performing Berry phase calculations for a model\nsuperstructure to find that the ferroelectric polarization occurs along the\nb-direction, in agreement with experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jun 2009 09:54:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

To consider computation as a physical process from an initial instance\nto the final acceptance is motivated because many natural processes have been\nrecognized to complete in non-polynomial time (NP). The irreversible process\nwith three or more degrees of freedom is found intractable because, in terms of\nphysics, flows of energy are inseparable from their driving forces. In\ncomputational terms, when solving problems in the class NP, decisions will\naffect subsequently available sets of decisions. The state space of a\nnon-deterministic finite automaton is evolving due to the computation itself\nhence it cannot be efficiently contracted using a deterministic finite\nautomaton that will arrive at a solution in super-polynomial time. The solution\nof the NP problem itself is verifiable in polynomial time (P) because the\ncorresponding state is stationary. Likewise the class P set of states does not\ndepend on computational history hence it can be efficiently contracted to the\naccepting state by a deterministic sequence of dissipative transformations.\nThus it is concluded that the class P set of states is inherently smaller than\nthe set of class NP.

We present a quantitative approach to this\nissue based on the concept of the hydrostatic energy, considered for a general\nshape of the immersed cross-section of the floating body. We show that the\nlocation of A depends on the type of motion experienced by the body. In\nparticular, in vertical translation, from the work-energy viewpoint, this point\nis fixed with respect to the centre of gravity G of the body. In contrast, in\nrolling/pitching motion there is duality in the location of A ; indeed, the\nwork-energy relation implies A to be fixed with respect to the centre of\nbuoyancy C, while from considerations involving the rotational moment it\nfollows that A is located at the metacentre M. We obtain analytical expressions\nof the location of M for a general shape of the immersed cross-section of the\nfloating body and for an arbitrary angle of heel.

Among\nthe many scientific applications for this data are the search for compact\ngalaxies. In this paper, we present the discovery of seven compact (but quite\nluminous) stellar systems, ranging from M32-like galaxies down to ultra-compact\ndwarfs (UCDs)/dwarf to globular transition objects (DGTOs). We find that all\nseven compact galaxies require a two-component fit to their light profile and\nhave measured velocity dispersions that exceed those expected for typical\nearly-type galaxies at their luminosity. From our structural parameter analysis\nwe conclude that three of the sample should be classified as compact\nellipticals or M32-like galaxies, the remaining four being less extreme\nsystems. The three compact ellipticals are all found to have old luminosity\nweighted ages (> 12 Gyr), intermediate metallicities (-0.6 < [Fe/H] < -0.1) and\nhigh [Mg/Fe] (> 0.25).

Three of the disks are consistent with the predictions of steady\nstate planetesimal disk evolution models. The oldest source, HD 169666,\ndisplays a dust fractional luminosity too high to be in steady state and we\nsuggest that this system recently underwent a transient event of dust\nproduction. In addition, two spectra of this star separated by ~three years\nshow silicate emission features, indicative of submicron- to micron-sized\ngrains. We argue that such small grains would be rapidly depleted and their\npresence in both spectra suggests that the production of small dust is\ncontinuous over at least on few years timescale.

The model is applied\nto structures on galactic scales (normal and dwarf spiral galaxies) and on\ncluster of galaxies scales. The results obtained suggest that angular momentum\nand dynamical friction are able, on galactic scales, to overcome the competing\neffect of adiabatic contraction eliminating the cusp. The NFW profile can be\nreobtained, in our model only if the system is constituted just by dark matter\nand the magnitude of angular momentum and dynamical friction are reduced with\nrespect to the values predicted by the model itself.

Particularly, the 4-momentum could be non-colinear to the electron\n4-velocity. This ambiguity in the electron 4-momentum allows us to assume that\nthe mass of emitting electron may be an operator, or, at least, a 4-tensor\ninstead of being the usually assumed scalar, which relates the 4-velocity of a\nbare charge to the total momentum of a dressed point electron, the latter being\na total of the momentum of the bare electron and that of the own\nelectromagnetic field.\n  On applying the re-normalization procedure to the mass operator, we arrive at\nan interesting dichotomy. The first choice (more close to traditional one)\nensures the radiation force to be orthogonal to the 4-velocity. In this way the\nre-normalization results in the Lorentz-Abraham-Dirac equation or in the\nEliezer equation. However, the 4-momentum of electron in this case is not well\ndefined: the equality in the relativistic entity (E/c)^2=m^2c^2+p^2 appears to\nbe broken and even the energy is not definite positive. The latter is an\nunderlying reason for the 'run-away' solution.\n  The other choice is to require the radiation force to be orthogonal to the\n4-momentum (not to the 4-velocity). In this case the energy and momentum are\nwell-defined and obey the relationship (E/c)^2=m^2c^2+p^2. Remarkably, the\nequations of a particle's motion in this case differ significantly from all the\nknown versions. They appear to be well founded. They are simple, easy to solve,\nand can be applied to simulate the particle motion in the focus of an\nultra-bright laser.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jun 2009 15:41:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Jun 2009 14:15:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Thus the charge degrees of freedom\nwill be modeled by an Ising order parameter in the presence of quenched\ndisorder, so representing a charge glassy phase.
