Our method is based on a\nmaximum likelihood fit to the pixel histogram, sometimes called 'P(D)', an\napproach which has been used before to probe faint counts, the difference being\nthat here we advocate its use even for sources with relatively high\nsignal-to-noise ratios. This method has an advantage over standard techniques\nof source extraction in providing an unbiased estimate of the counts from the\nbright end down to flux densities well below the confusion limit. We\nspecifically analyse BLAST observations of a roughly 10 sq. deg. map centered\non the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey South (GOODS-S) field. We\nprovide estimates of number counts at the three BLAST wavelengths, 250, 350,\nand 500 microns; instead of counting sources in flux bins we estimate the\ncounts at several flux density nodes connected with power-laws. We observe a\ngenerally very steep slope for the counts of about -3.7 at 250 microns and -4.5\nat 350 and 500 microns, over the range ~0.02-0.5 Jy, breaking to a shallower\nslope below about 0.015 Jy at all three wavelengths. We also describe how to\nestimate the uncertainties and correlations in this method so that the results\ncan be used for model-fitting. This method should be well-suited for analysis\nof data from the Herschel satellite.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jun 2009 16:02:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2009 15:27:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-10"}

They present a break in the\nluminosity profile at 3.0 +- 0.5 disk scale lengths, while showing an\nexponential mass profile without any apparent breaks, in line with recent\nobservational results. Since the stellar mass profile is exponential, only\ndifferences in the stellar populations can be the cause of the luminosity\nbreak. Although we find a cutoff for the star formation rate imposed by a\ndensity threshold in our star formation model, it does not coincide with the\nluminosity break and is located at 4.3 +- 0.4 disk scale lengths, with star\nformation going on between both radii. The color profiles and the age profiles\nare \"U-shaped\", with the minimum for both profiles located approximately at the\nbreak radius. The SFR to stellar mass ratio increases until the break,\nexplaining the coincidence of the break with the minimum of the age profile.\nBeyond the break we find a steep decline in the gas density and, consequently,\na decline in the SFR and redder colors. We show that most stars (64-78%) in the\nouter disk originate in the inner disk and afterwards migrate there.

This raises the question\nwhether the observed spatial variations in wing polarization have a magnetic or\nnon-magnetic origin.

In the absence of delay, we show that an\nintermediate intensity of noise is able to optimally assist the pacemaker in\nimposing its rhythm on the whole ensemble, irrespective to its placing, thus\nproviding evidences for stochastic resonance on the scale-free neuronal\nnetworks. Interestingly thereby, if the forcing in form of a periodic pulse\ntrain is introduced to all neurons forming the network, the stochastic\nresonance decreases as compared to the case when only a single neuron is paced.\nMoreover, we show that finite delays in coupling can significantly affect the\nstochastic resonance on scale-free neuronal networks.

We quantify the\nmass growth rates via these two processes, dM_mer/dt and dM_dif/dt, and their\ndependence on halo environment using the ~500,000 haloes in the Millennium\nsimulation. Adopting a local mass density parameter as a measure of halo\nenvironment, we find the two rates show strong but opposite environmental\ndependence, with mergers playing an increasingly important role for halo\ngrowths in overdense regions and diffuse accretion dominating growth in voids.\nThis behaviour is independent of the mass cuts used to define haloes vs\nnon-haloes. For galaxy-scale haloes, these two opposite correlations largely\ncancel out, but a weak environmental dependence remains that results in a\nslightly lower mean total growth rate, and hence an earlier mean formation\nredshift, for haloes in denser regions. The mean formation redshift of the\n~5000 cluster-mass haloes, on the other hand, appears to have no correlation\nwith halo environment. The origin of the positive correlation of dM_mer/dt with\nlocal density can be traced to the surrounding mass reservoir outside the\nhaloes, where more progenitor haloes are available in denser regions. The\nnegative correlation of dM_dif/dt with density, however, is not explained by\nthe available diffuse mass in the reservoir, which is in fact larger in denser\nregions. The non-halo component may therefore be partially comprised of truly\ndiffuse dark matter particles that are dynamically hotter and are accreted at a\nsuppressed rate in denser regions.

We confirm that the acoustic peak traced by the dark\nmatter is both broadened and shifted as structure forms, and that this shift is\nwell described by second-order perturbation theory. These shifts persist for\ndark matter halos, and are a simple function of halo bias, with the shift\n(mostly) increasing with increasing bias. Extending our perturbation theory\nresults to halos with simple two parameter bias models (both in Lagrangian and\nEulerian space) quantitatively explains the observed shifts. In particular, we\ndemonstrate that there are additional terms that contribute to the shift that\nare absent for the matter. At z=0 for currently favored cosmologies, the matter\nshows shifts of ~0.5%, b=1 halos shift the acoustic scale by ~0.2%, while b=2\nhalos shift it by ~0.5%; these shifts decrease by the square of the growth\nfactor at higher redshifts. These results are easily generalized to galaxies\nwithin the halo model, where we show that simple galaxy models show marginally\nlarger shifts than the correspondingly biased halos, due to the contribution of\nsatellites in high mass halos.

We present a\nmulti-wavelength analysis of an M1.6 flare occurring in the active region NOAA\n10365 on 27 May, 2003, in which a large new bipole emerges in a decaying active\nregion. The diverging flow pattern and the \"tongue\" shape of the magnetic field\nin the photosphere with elongated polarities are highly suggestive of the\nemergence of a twisted flux tube. The orientation of these tongues indicates\nthe emergence of a flux tube with a right hand twist, i.e. positive magnetic\nhelicity. The flare signatures in the chromosphere are ribbons observed in\nH-alpha by the MSDP spectrograph in the Meudon solar tower and in 1600 A by\nTRACE. These ribbons have a `J' shape and are shifted along the inversion line.\nThe pattern of these ribbons suggests that the flare was triggered by magnetic\nreconnection at coronal heights below a twisted flux tube of positive helicity,\ncorresponding to that of the observed emergence. It is the first time that such\na consistency between the signatures of the emerging flux through the\nphotosphere and flare ribbons is clearly identified in observations. Another\ntype of ribbons observed during the flare at the periphery of the active region\nby the MSDP and SOHO/EIT are related to the existence of a null point, which is\nfound high in the corona in a potential field extrapolation. We discuss the\ninterpretation of these secondary brightenings in terms of the \"breakout\" model\nand in terms of plasma compression/heating within large-scale separatrices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Jun 2009 08:01:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Measurements of radial and elliptic flows, with\npossible coalescence of \"constituent quarks\" to form hadrons, seem to support\nthe conclusion.

The analogous\ngeometrical picture for three-level systems is presented, with several\napplications. The relevant SU(3) group and su(3) algebra are eight-dimensional\nobjects and are realized in our picture as two four-dimensional manifolds\ndescribing the time evolution operator. The first, called the base manifold, is\nthe counterpart of the S^2 Bloch sphere, whereas the second, called the fiber,\ngeneralizes the single U(1) phase of a single spin. Now four-dimensional, it\nbreaks down further into smaller objects depending on alternative\nrepresentations that we discuss. Geometrical phases are also developed and\npresented for specific applications. Arbitrary time-dependent couplings between\nthree levels or between two spins (qubits) with SU(3) Hamiltonians can be\nconveniently handled through these geometrical objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Jun 2009 09:39:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-28"}

Starting from recent results, we consider the gravitomagnetic\nfield of a source whose spin angular momentum has a linearly time-varying\nmagnitude. The acceleration due to such a time-varying gravitomagnetic field is\nconsidered as a perturbation of the Newtonian motion, and we explicitly\nevaluate the effects of this perturbation on the Keplerian elements of a closed\norbit. The theoretical predictions are compared with actual astronomical and\nastrophysical scenarios, both in the solar system and in binary pulsars\nsystems, in order to evaluate the impact of these effects on real systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Jun 2009 14:32:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2009 21:58:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 13 Apr 2010 09:04:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

The comparison is performed for three separate defect cases: a\ngallium vacancy in GaAs, a beryllium interstitial in GaAs and a vacancy in\ndiamond.
