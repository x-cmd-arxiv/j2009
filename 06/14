We use renormalization group to study\ntheir effects on low-energy properties of the system, and show that the two\nquadratic Fermi points spontaneously split into four Dirac points, at zero\ntemperature.

This galaxy is unusual among late-type (Sc) disk galaxies in having a\nvery large radial extent and inferred dynamical mass. We propose a head-on\ncollision scenario to explain the perturbed morphology of this galaxy- both the\noff-centered rings and the inflated radius. This scenario is supported by the\ndetection of a steep velocity gradient in the CO(1-0) map at the position of a\nsouthwest peak in radio continuum and near-infrared emission. This peak would\nrepresent the remnant of the disrupting companion. We use numerical models to\ndemonstrate the plausibility of the scenario. While ram pressure stripping\ncould in principle be important for shocking the atomic gas and produce the\nstriking head-tail morphology, the non detection of this small galaxy group in\nX-ray emission suggests that any hot intragroup medium has too low a density.\nThe collision with the companion of mass ratio 1:4 produces a lopsided wave,\nwhich accounts for the sharp boundary observed in the atomic gas on the\nsouthern side. We argue that NGC1961 has a strongly warped disk, which gives\nthe false impression of a nearly face-on system; the main disk is actually more\nedge-on, and this error in the true inclination has led to the surprisingly\nhigh dynamical mass for a morphologically late-type galaxy. In addition, the\noutward propagating ring artificially enlarges the disk. The collision\nde-stabilizes the inner disk and can provide gas inflow to the active nucleus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Jun 2009 17:58:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

In combinatorial\ngeometry these transitions appear as abrupt changes in the properties of face\ncounts of convex polytopes when the dimensions are varied. The thresholds in\nthese very different problems appear in the same critical locations after\nappropriate calibration of variables.\n  These thresholds are important in each subject area: for linear modelling,\nthey place hard limits on the degree to which the now-ubiquitous\nhigh-throughput data analysis can be successful; for robustness, they place\nhard limits on the degree to which standard robust fitting methods can tolerate\noutliers before breaking down; for compressed sensing, they define the sharp\nboundary of the undersampling/sparsity tradeoff in undersampling theorems.\n  Existing derivations of phase transitions in combinatorial geometry assume\nthe underlying matrices have independent and identically distributed (iid)\nGaussian elements. In applications, however, it often seems that Gaussianity is\nnot required. We conducted an extensive computational experiment and formal\ninferential analysis to test the hypothesis that these phase transitions are\n{\\it universal} across a range of underlying matrix ensembles.

However, artifacts\nsuch as instrument data and associated calibration information may have little\nvalue in isolation; their meaning is derived from their relationships to each\nother. Individual artifacts are best represented as components of a life cycle\nthat is specific to a scientific research domain or project. Current cataloging\npractices do not describe objects at a sufficient level of granularity nor do\nthey offer the globally persistent identifiers necessary to discover and manage\nscholarly products with World Wide Web standards. The Open Archives\nInitiative's Object Reuse and Exchange data model (OAI-ORE) meets these\nrequirements. We demonstrate a conceptual implementation of OAI-ORE to\nrepresent the scientific life cycles of embedded networked sensor applications\nin seismology and environmental sciences. By establishing relationships between\npublications, data, and contextual research information, we illustrate how to\nobtain a richer and more realistic view of scientific practices. That view can\nfacilitate new forms of scientific research and learning. Our analysis is\nframed by studies of scientific practices in a large, multi-disciplinary,\nmulti-university science and engineering research center, the Center for\nEmbedded Networked Sensing (CENS).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Jun 2009 15:23:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2009 18:26:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2009 00:53:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-19"}

The aim of this paper is to determine some\nof the optimum conditions required to detect DCE photons relevant to a novel\nexperimental detection system. We expand upon the thin plasma sheet model\n[Crocce et al., Phys. Rev. A 70 033811 (2004)] to estimate the number of\nphotons for both TE and TM modes at any given SD position. Numerical\ncalculations are performed considering up to 51 inter-mode couplings by varying\nthe SD location, driving period and laser power without any perturbations. It\nis found that the number of photons created for TE modes strongly depends on SD\nposition, where the strongest enhancement occurs at the midpoint (not near the\ncavity wall); while TM modes have weak dependence on SD position. Another\nimportant finding is the fact that significant photon production for TM$_{111}$\nmodes still takes place at the midpoint even for a low laser power of 0.01\nmicro J/pulse, although the number of TE$_{111}$ photons decreases almost\nproportionately with laser power. We also find a relatively wide tuning range\nfor both TE and TM modes that is correlated with the frequency variation of the\ninstantaneous mode functions caused by the interaction between the cavity\nphotons and conduction electrons in the SD excited by a pulsed laser.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Jun 2009 15:39:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2009 12:39:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2009 15:49:33 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2010 15:44:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-19"}

We present a scenario where a supersolid is induced in one of the\ncomponents of a mixture of two species bosonic atoms where there is no long\nrange interactions. We study a system of normal and hardcore boson mixture with\nonly the former possessing long range interactions. We consider three cases:\nthe first where the total density is commensurate and the other two where they\nare incommensurate . By suitable choices of the densities and the interaction\nstrengths of the atoms, we predict that the charge density wave and the\nsupersolid orders can be induced in the hardcore species as a result of the\ncompeting interatomic interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Jun 2009 15:56:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-16"}
