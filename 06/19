Among the sample of 43 stars are a number of\nwhite dwarfs that are either metal-rich, magnetic, or binary suspects. With a\nfew notable exceptions in four (or possibly five) distinct categories, the\nnewly obtained JHK photometric data fail to corroborate the putative excesses,\nwith K_IRTF - K_2MASS = +0.31 mag. Where available, GALEX photometric data are\nused to better constrain the overall spectral energy distribution of the white\ndwarfs, enabling any excess near-infrared flux to stand out more readily\nagainst the expected stellar photosphere.\n  With superior data, a near-infrared photometric excess is confirmed at three\nmetal-rich white dwarfs and ruled out at nine others. Several new binaries are\nconfirmed or suggested; five white dwarf - red dwarf pairs and five double\ndegenerates. Four apparently single magnetic white dwarfs -- two DA and two DQp\n-- display modest to strong near-infrared excess (relative to non-magnetic\nmodels), which may be better described as two effective temperatures owing to a\nredistribution of energy in highly magnetic or peculiar atmospheres.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2009 16:52:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-06"}

By placing\nadditive penalties on the inverse covariance matrices of the rows and columns,\nthese so-called transposable regularized covariance models allow for maximum\nlikelihood estimation of the mean and nonsingular covariance matrices.

This article, the first of a series dedicated to the study of IRDCs,\ndescribes techniques developed to establish a complete catalogue of Spitzer\nIRDCs in the Galaxy. We have analysed Spitzer GLIMPSE and MIPSGAL data to\nidentify a complete sample of IRDCs in the region of Galactic longitude and\nlatitude 10deg < |l|<65deg and |b|<1deg. From the 8micron observations we have\nconstructed opacity maps and used a newly developed extraction algorithm to\nidentify structures above a column density of N_{H2} > 1x10^{22} cm^{-2}. The\n24micron data are then used to characterize the star formation activity of each\nextracted cloud. A total of 11303 clouds have been extracted. A comparison with\nthe existing MSX based catalogue of IRDCs shows that 80% of these Spitzer dark\nclouds were previously unknown. The algorithm also extracts ~ 20000 to 50000\nfragments within these clouds, depending on detection threshold used. A first\nlook at the MIPSGAL data indicates that between 20% and 68% of these IRDCs show\n24micron point-like association.

A neutral generative model\nassumes that each microscopic process follows unbiased stochastic fluctuations:\nrandom connections of network nodes; amino acid substitutions with no effect on\nfitness; species that arise or disappear from communities randomly. These\nneutral generative models often match common patterns of nature. In this paper,\nI present the theoretical background by which we can understand why these\nneutral generative models are so successful. I show how the classic patterns\nsuch as Poisson and Gaussian arise. Each classic pattern was often discovered\nby a simple neutral generative model. The neutral patterns share a special\ncharacteristic: they describe the patterns of nature that follow from simple\nconstraints on information. For example, any aggregation of processes that\npreserves information only about the mean and variance attracts to the Gaussian\npattern; any aggregation that preserves information only about the mean\nattracts to the exponential pattern; any aggregation that preserves information\nonly about the geometric mean attracts to the power law pattern.

The neural net is trained to reproduce the SEDs\npredicted by a hybrid code comprised of the GALFORM semi-analytical model of\ngalaxy formation, which predicts the full star formation and galaxy merger\nhistories, and the GRASIL spectro-photometric code, which carries out a\nself-consistent calculation of the SED, including absorption and emission of\nradiation by dust. Using a small number of galaxy properties predicted by\nGALFORM, the method reproduces the luminosities of galaxies in the majority of\ncases to within 10% of those computed directly using GRASIL. The method\nperforms best in the sub-mm and reasonably well in the mid-infrared and the\nfar-ultra-violet. The luminosity error introduced by the method has negligible\nimpact on predicted statistical distributions, such as luminosity functions or\ncolour distributions of galaxies. We use the neural net to predict the overlap\nbetween galaxies selected in the rest-frame UV and in the observer-frame sub-mm\nat z=2.

However, only 1% of\nthe galaxies selected in the rest-frame UV down to R_AB < 25 mag should have\n850um fluxes brighter than 5 mJy. Our technique will allow the generation of\nwide-angle mock catalogues of galaxies selected at rest-frame UV or mid- and\nfar-infrared wavelengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2009 20:34:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The support of such\ncontent-based retrieval requires not only the formulation of an appropriate\nscoring function for defining relevant subregions but also the design of new\naccess methods that can scale to large databases. In this paper, we propose a\nsolution to this problem of querying significant image subregions. We design a\nscoring scheme to measure the similarity of subregions. Our similarity measure\nextends to any image descriptor. All the images are tiled and each alignment of\nthe query and a database image produces a tile score matrix.

These strategies are general enough to work with other\nscoring schemes and heuristics. Experimental results on real image datasets\nshow that TARS saves more than 87% query time on small queries, and SPARS saves\nup to 52% query time on large queries as compared to linear search.

When a periodic solicitation is applied to an elementary fibre, an increase\nof the fibre rigidity and a reduction of the damping capacity are observed.\nThese evolutions aim at stabilization after an identified number of cycles,\ntraducing a phenomenon of \"adaptation\". This specific mechanical behaviour\ncertainly involves biochemical and/or structural modifications in the material\norganisation as microfibrils reorientation. In addition, the behaviour of hemp\nfibres is affected by temperature. Temperature acts as an activation factor but\nalso as a degradation factor of the viscoelastic properties of fibres. The\nrigidity and the endurance of fibres are highly affected by thermal treatment\nat temperature above 150\\degree C to 180\\degree C.

As\nexpected, the radial direction always revealed a higher storage modulus than\nthe tangential direction. Great differences were also observed in the loss\nfactor.

In this work, we also\npoint out that the time-temperature equivalence fits only around the transition\nregion, i.e. between Tg and Tg + 30\\degree C. Apart from these regions, the\nwood response combines the effect of all constitutive polymers, so that the\nequivalence is not valid anymore.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jun 2009 09:28:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-22"}

Phenomenological models are\noften represented as low-order dynamical systems. These are tractable, and a\nrich source of insights about climate dynamics, but they also ignore large\nbodies of information on the climate system, and their parameters are generally\nnot operationally defined.

It is transient, faint, and located in a very\ncrowded region, only 10 arcmin from the supermassive black hole Sgr A*.\nTherefore, its bursting behavior has been poorly studied so far. In particular,\nits persistent emission has rarely been detected between consecutive bursts,\ndue to lack of sensitivity or confusion. This is what made GRS 1741.9-2853 one\nof the nine \"burst-only sources\" identified by BeppoSAX a few years ago. The\nphysical properties of GRS 1741.9-2853 bursts are yet of great interest since\nwe know very little about the nuclear regimes at stake in low accretion rate\nbursters. We examine here for the first time several bursts in relation with\nthe persistent emission of the source, using INTEGRAL, XMM-Newton, and Swift\nobservations. We investigate the source flux variability and bursting behavior\nduring its 2005 and 2007 long outbursts. The persistent luminosity of GRS\n1741.9-2853 varied between ~1.7 and 10.5 10^36 erg s^-1, i.e. 0.9-5.3% of the\nEddington luminosity. The shape of the spectrum as described by an absorbed\npower-law remained with a photon index Gamma ~ 2 and a column density $N_{\\rm\nH} ~ 12 10^22 cm^-2 throughout the outbursts. We discovered 11 type-I bursts\nwith INTEGRAL, and inspected 4 additional bursts: 2 recorded by XMM-Newton and\n2 by Swift. From the brigthest burst, we derive an upper limit on the source\ndistance of ~7 kpc. The observed bursts characteristics and source accretion\nrate suggest pure helium explosions igniting at column depths y_{ign} ~ 0.8-4.8\n10^8 g cm^-1, for typical energy releases of ~1.2-7.4 10^39 erg.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jun 2009 10:29:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

During this\ninterval, the pulsar experienced eight glitch-like events with a fractional\nincrease in the rotation frequency Deltanu/nu=(0.9-2.6)x10^{-9}. We have\nrevealed two important relations in the properties of these peculiar glitches.\nThe first result shows that there is a strong linear correlation between the\namplitude of the glitch and the time interval to the next glitch. The second\nresult shows that the amplitude of the glitches is modulated by a periodic\nlarge-scale sawtooth-like function. As a result of this modulation, the glitch\namplitude varies discretely from glitch to glitch with a step of 1.5x10^{-9} Hz\nin the range (2.4-6.9)x10^{-9} Hz. The post-glitch time interval also varies\ndiscretely with a step of about 600 days in the range 900-2700 days. An\nanalysis of the data showed that three modulation schemes with modulation\nperiods of 43 years, 53 years and 60 years are possible. The best model is the\n60-year modulation scheme including 12 glitches. We make a conclusion that the\nnature of the observed cyclical changes in the timing residuals from PSR\nB1642-03 is a continuous generation of peculiar glitches whose amplitudes are\nmodulated by a periodic large-scale sawtooth-like function. As the modulation\nfunction is periodical, the picture of cyclical timing residuals will be\nexactly repeated in each modulation period or every 60 years.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jun 2009 11:02:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-22"}

This\nsensing ability is remarkable as cells must be able to spatially resolve small\nfractional differences in the numbers of particles randomly arriving at\ncell-surface receptors by diffusion. An additional challenge and source of\nuncertainty is that particles, once bound and released, may rebind the same or\na different receptor, which adds to noise without providing any new information\nabout the environment. We recently derived the fundamental physical limits of\ngradient sensing using a simple spherical-cell model, but not including\nexplicit particle-receptor kinetics. Here, we use a method based on the\nfluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) to calculate the accuracy of gradient\nsensing by realistic receptors.

While the former has been widely\nexplored, the effects of eta-quenching in the magnetic field evolution have\nrarely been considered. In this work we investigate the role of the suppression\nof diffusivity in a flux-transport solar dynamo model that also includes a\nnon-linear alpha-quenching term. Our results indicate that, although for\nalpha-quenching the dependence of the magnetic field amplification with the\nquenching factor is nearly linear, the magnetic field response to eta-quenching\nis non-linear and spatially non-uniform. We have found that the magnetic field\ncan be locally amplified in this case, forming long-lived structures whose\nmaximum amplitude can be up to ~2.5 times larger at the tachocline and up to ~2\ntimes larger at the center of the convection zone than in models without\nquenching. However, this amplification leads to unobservable effects and to a\nworse distribution of the magnetic field in the butterfly diagram. Since the\ndynamo cycle period increases when the efficiency of the quenching increases,\nwe have also explored whether the eta-quenching can cause a diffusion-dominated\nmodel to drift into an advection-dominated regime. We have found that models\nundergoing a large suppression of the diffusivity produce a strong segregation\nof magnetic fields that may lead to unsteady dynamo-oscillations. On the other\nhand, an initially diffusion-dominated model undergoing a small suppression in\neta remains in the diffusion-dominated regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jun 2009 14:44:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-05"}

The previously adopted\nrelation log [SFR(PAH)] = log [vLv(7.7 um)] - 42.57+-0.2, for SFR in solar\nmasses per year and vLv(7.7 um) the luminosity at the peak of the 7.7 um PAH\nfeature in ergs per s, is found to agree with SFR(radio). Comparing with\nSFR(UV) determined independently from ultraviolet observations of the same\nsources with the GALEX mission (not corrected for dust extinction), the median\nlog [SFR(PAH)/SFR(UV)] = 1.67, indicating that only 2% of the ultraviolet\ncontinuum typically escapes extinction by dust within a starburst. The ratio\nSFR(PAH)/SFR(UV) depends on infrared luminosity, with form log\n[SFR(PAH)/SFR(UV)]= (0.53+-0.05)log Lir - 4.11+-0.18, for Lir in solar\nluminosities. We also find that the ratio SFR(PAH)/SFR(UV) is similar to that\nin infrared-selected starbursts for a sample of Markarian starburst galaxies\noriginally selected using optical classification, which implies that there is\nno significant selection effect in SFR(PAH)/SFR(UV) using starburst galaxies\ndiscovered by Spitzer. These results indicate that SFRs determined with\nultraviolet luminosities require dust corrections by a factor of ~ 10 for\ntypical local starbursts but this factor increases to > 700 for the most\nluminous starbursts at z ~ 2.5. With this amount of extinction, the optical\nmagnitude of a starburst having fv(7.7 um) of 1 mJy should be V ~ 25.6.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jun 2009 14:55:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2009 14:39:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

Photodissociation by UV light is an important destruction mechanism for\nCO in many astrophysical environments, ranging from interstellar clouds to\nprotoplanetary disks. The aim of this work is to gain a better understanding of\nthe depth dependence and isotope-selective nature of this process.\n  Methods. We present a photodissociation model based on recent spectroscopic\ndata from the literature, which allows us to compute depth-dependent and\nisotope-selective photodissociation rates at higher accuracy than in previous\nwork. The model includes self-shielding, mutual shielding and shielding by\natomic and molecular hydrogen, and it is the first such model to include the\nrare isotopologues C17O and 13C17O. We couple it to a simple chemical network\nto analyse CO abundances in diffuse and translucent clouds, photon-dominated\nregions, and circumstellar disks.\n  Results. The photodissociation rate in the unattenuated interstellar\nradiation field is 2.6e-10 s^-1, 30% higher than currently adopted values.\nIncreasing the excitation temperature or the Doppler width can reduce the\nphotodissociation rates and the isotopic selectivity by as much as a factor of\nthree for temperatures above 100 K. The model reproduces column densities\nobserved towards diffuse clouds and PDRs, and it offers an explanation for both\nthe enhanced and the reduced N(12CO)/N(13CO) ratios seen in diffuse clouds. The\nphotodissociation of C17O and 13C17O shows almost exactly the same depth\ndependence as that of C18O and 13C18O, respectively, so 17O and 18O are equally\nfractionated with respect to 16O. This supports the recent hypothesis that CO\nphotodissociation in the solar nebula is responsible for the anomalous 17O and\n18O abundances in meteorites.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jun 2009 15:39:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}
