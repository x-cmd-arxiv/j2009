Then, through\nthe Jeans equation, the mass profile is derived in terms of double integrals of\nobservable quantities. Single integral formulas for both deprojection and mass\ninversion are provided for several simple anisotropy models (isotropic, radial,\ncircular, general constant, Osipkov-Merritt, Mamon-Lokas and\nDiemand-Moore-Stadel). Tests of the mass inversion on NFW models with these\nanisotropy models yield accurate results in the case of perfect observational\ndata, and typically better than 70% (in 4 cases out of 5) accurate mass\nprofiles for the sampling errors expected from current observational data on\nclusters of galaxies. For the NFW model with mildly increasing radial\nanisotropy, the mass is found to be insensitive to the adopted anisotropy\nprofile at 7 scale radii and to the adopted anisotropy radius at 3 scale radii.\nThis anisotropic mass inversion method is a useful complementary tool to\nanalyze the mass and anisotropy profiles of spherical systems. It provides the\npractical means to lift the MAD in quasi-spherical systems such as globular\nclusters, round dwarf spheroidal and elliptical galaxies, as well as groups and\nclusters of galaxies, when the anisotropy of the tracer is expected to be\nlinearly related to the slope of its density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2009 16:31:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2009 19:00:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2009 13:20:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-11"}

Adding\nmatter fermions in Loop Quantum Gravity may require the extension of the Holst\naction through the Nieh-Yan topological invariant, while in pure, matter-free\nsupergravity their supersymmetric extensions are the same. We show that, when\nthe Barbero-Immirzi parameter is promoted to a field in the context of 4D\nsupergravity, it is equivalent to adding a dynamical complex chiral\n(dilaton-axion) superfield with a non-trivial kinetic term (or K\\\"ahler\npotential), coupled to supergravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2009 17:13:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 27 Jun 2009 13:20:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 2009 21:15:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}

Besides, our model shows a clear excess with respect to observations of\nfaint Lyman-break galaxies, especially of z_{850} ~ 27 V-dropouts at z ~ 5. We\nquantify the properties of these \"excess\" galaxies and discuss the\nimplications: these galaxies are hosted in dark matter halos with circular\nvelocities in excess of 100 km s^{-1}, and their suppression may require a deep\nre-thinking of stellar feedback processes taking place in galaxy formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2009 20:30:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

When all individuals engage in this type of information exchange, the\nsociety will be able to effectively aggregate the initial information held by\nall individuals. There is also the possibility of misinformation, however,\nbecause some of the individuals are \"forceful,\" meaning that they influence the\nbeliefs of (some) of the other individuals they meet, but do not change their\nown opinion. The paper characterizes how the presence of forceful agents\ninterferes with information aggregation.

The simulations were performed\nusing a much longer simulation system than our previous simulations in order to\ninvestigate the full nonlinear stage of the Weibel instability and its particle\nacceleration mechanism. Cold jet electrons are thermalized and ambient\nelectrons are accelerated in the resulting shocks. Acceleration of ambient\nelectrons leads to a maximum ambient electron density three times larger than\nthe original value. Behind the bow shock in the jet shock strong\nelectromagnetic fields are generated. These fields may lead to time dependent\nafterglow emission. We calculated radiation from electrons propagating in a\nuniform parallel magnetic field to verify the technique. We also used the new\ntechnique to calculate emission from electrons based on simulations with a\nsmall system.

Previous studies have shown\nthat beta-adrenergic stimulation increases QT/RR slope, but the effects of\nbeta-adrenergic stimulation on QT/RR slope in heart failure are unknown.\nMethods: New Zealand White rabbits underwent coronary ligation (n=15) or sham\nsurgery (n=11), and implantation of a pediatric pacemaker lead in the right\nventricle for chronic ECG recording. Eight weeks after surgery, unsedated\nrabbits were given intravenous administrations of 0.25 to 2.0 ml of 1\nmicromol/l isoprenaline, while peak QRS to QRS (RR) and Q to T peak (QT)\nintervals were measured. Results: Ligated rabbits (n=6) had lower LVEF than\nsham rabbits (n=7, p<.0001), but similar baseline RR (269 +/- 15 vs 292 +/- 23\nms, p=.07), QT (104 +/- 17 vs 91 +/- 9 ms, p=.1) and minimum RR (204 +/- 11 vs\n208 +/- 6 ms, p=.4) intervals induced by isoprenaline (0.79 +/- 0.18 vs 0.73\n+/- 0.14 ml, p=.6).

The analysis is based on extracting a set of features from a\nhand image and then combining them by using an induction graph. The most\nimportant features we extract from each image are the fingers locations, their\nheights and the distance between each pair of fingers. Our approach consists of\nthree steps: (i) Hand detection and localization, (ii) fingers extraction and\n(iii) features identification and combination to digit recognition. Each input\nimage is assumed to contain only one person, thus we apply a fuzzy classifier\nto identify the skin pixels. In the finger extraction step, we attempt to\nremove all the hand components except the fingers, this process is based on the\nhand anatomy properties. The final step consists on representing histogram of\nthe detected fingers in order to extract features that will be used for digit\nrecognition.

A major reason for this preference is the\nwell-known problem of inconsistency of estimators based on regular sampling,\nwhen the underlying power spectral density is not bandlimited. It is argued in\nthis paper that, in consideration of a large sample property like consistency,\nit is natural to allow the sampling rate to go to infinity as the sample size\ngoes to infinity. Through appropriate asymptotic calculations under this\nscenario, it is shown that the smoothed periodogram based on regularly spaced\ndata is a consistent estimator of the spectral density, even when the latter is\nnot band-limited. It transpires that, under similar assumptions, the estimators\nbased on uniformly sampled and Poisson-sampled data have about the same rate of\nconvergence. Apart from providing this reassuring message, the paper also gives\na guideline for practitioners regarding appropriate choice of the sampling\nrate.

In bin packing problems, a set of one-dimensional items of\nsize at most 1 is to be assigned (packed) to subsets of sum at most 1 (bins).\nIt has been known for a while that the most basic problem admits an AFPTAS. In\nthis paper, we develop methods that allow to extend this result to other\nvariants of bin packing. Specifically, the problems which we study in this\npaper, for which we design asymptotic fully polynomial time approximation\nschemes, are the following. The first problem is \"Bin packing with cardinality\nconstraints\", where a parameter k is given, such that a bin may contain up to k\nitems. The goal is to minimize the number of bins used. The second problem is\n\"Bin packing with rejection\", where every item has a rejection penalty\nassociated with it. An item needs to be either packed to a bin or rejected, and\nthe goal is to minimize the number of used bins plus the total rejection\npenalty of unpacked items. This resolves the complexity of two important\nvariants of the bin packing problem. Our approximation schemes use a novel\nmethod for packing the small items. This new method is the core of the improved\nrunning times of our schemes over the running times of the previous results,\nwhich are only asymptotic polynomial time approximation schemes (APTAS).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Jun 2009 08:39:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-16"}

The model is parametrized by two values of\nanisotropy, at the centre of the cluster and at infinity, and two parameters of\nthe NFW density profile, the scale radius and the scale mass. In order to test\nthe performance of the method in reconstructing the true cluster parameters we\nanalyze mock kinematic data for 20 relaxed galaxy clusters generated from a\ncosmological simulation of the standard LCDM model.

This picture is relevant to a variety of physical systems, ranging\nfrom atomic nuclei to mesoscopic systems and microwave cavities; the main\napplication to be discussed in this contribution is to electronic transport\nthrough mesoscopic ballistic structures or quantum dots. The theory describes\nthe regime in which there are two distinct time scales, associated with a\nprompt and an equilibrated response, and is cast in terms of the matrix of\nscattering amplitudes S. We construct the ensemble of S matrices using a\nmaximum-entropy approach which incorporates the requirements of flux\nconservation, causality and ergodicity, and the system-specific average of S\nwhich quantifies the effect of prompt processes. The resulting ensemble, known\nas Poisson's kernel, is meant to describe those situations in which any other\ninformation is irrelevant. The results of this formulation have been compared\nwith the numerical solution of the Schroedinger equation for cavities in which\nthe assumptions of the theory hold. The model has a remarkable predictive\npower: it describes statistical properties of the quantum conductance of\nquantum dots, like its average, its fluctuations, and its full distribution in\nseveral cases. We also discuss situations that have been found recently, in\nwhich the notion of stationarity and ergodicity is not fulfilled, and yet\nPoisson's kernel gives a good description of the data.

The similarity between the maps for the\nleading and trailing triangular Lagrange points $L_4$ and $L_5$ confirms the\ndynamical symmetry between these two points. By computing the power spectrum\nand the proper frequencies of the Trojan motion, we figure out the mechanisms\nthat trigger chaos in the motion.

Both mechanisms\nlead to eccentric orbits and encounters with Uranus that introduce strong\nperturbation and drive the objects away from the Trojan like orbits.

Dwarf galaxy models initially consist of an exponential\nstellar disk embedded in an extended spherical dark matter halo. Depending on\nthe initial orientation of the disk with respect to the orbital plane,\ndifferent final configurations are obtained. The least evolved dwarf is\ntriaxial and retains a significant amount of rotation. The more evolved dwarfs\nare prolate spheroids with little rotation. We show that the final density\ndistribution of stars can be approximated by a simple modification of the\nPlummer law. The kinematics of the dwarfs is significantly different depending\non the line of sight which has important implications for mapping the observed\nstellar velocity dispersions of dwarfs to subhalo circular velocities. When the\ndwarfs are observed along the long axis, the measured velocity dispersion is\nhigher and decreases faster with radius.

Particles emitted radially outward with speed at infinity\nexceeding c/2^0.5 are observed to be accelerated in the gravitational field by\na distant observer. This is the Shapiro effect for relativistic particles.\nSlower particles are decelerated, as in Newtonian gravity. A speed-dependent\npotential for relativistic particles corresponding to the speed measured in\nterms of the coordinate time is derived to be $V=GM gamma(gamma^2 -2)/r which\nis repulsive for v>c/2^0.5. The gravitational repulsion could be revealed in\nsatellite experiments with beams of relativistic particles subject to very\nprecise time measurements.

For rooted trees, our measures\nare based on the topologies the input trees induce on triplets; that is, on\nthree-element subsets of the set of species. For unrooted trees, the measures\nare based on quartets (four-element subsets). Triplet and quartet-based\ndistances provide a robust and fine-grained measure of the similarities between\ntrees. The distinguishing feature of our distance measures relative to\ntraditional quartet and triplet distances is their ability to deal cleanly with\nthe presence of unresolved nodes, also called polytomies. For rooted trees,\nthese are nodes with more than two children; for unrooted trees, they are nodes\nof degree greater than three.\n  Our first class of measures are parametric distances, where there is a\nparameter that weighs the difference between an unresolved triplet/quartet\ntopology and a resolved one. Our second class of measures are based on\nHausdorff distance. Each tree is viewed as a set of all possible ways in which\nthe tree could be refined to eliminate unresolved nodes. The distance between\nthe original (unresolved) trees is then taken to be the Hausdorff distance\nbetween the associated sets of fully resolved trees, where the distance between\ntrees in the sets is the triplet or quartet distance, as appropriate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Jun 2009 15:56:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-30"}

We examine multiple\ncontributions to the magnetoresistance, including those of weak localization\n(WL), universal conductance fluctuations (UCF), and inhomogeneous charge\ntransport. A clear WL signal is evident at all measured gate voltages (in the\nhole doped regime) and temperature ranges (from 0.25 K to 4.3 K), and the phase\ncoherence length extracted from WL data does not saturate at low temperatures.\nThe WL data is fit to demonstrate that electron-electron Nyquist scattering is\nthe major source of phase decoherence. A decrease in UCF amplitude with\nincreasing gate voltage and temperature is shown to be consistent with a\ncorresponding decrease in the phase coherence length. In addition, a weak\npositive magnetoresistance at higher magnetic fields is observed, and\nattributed to inhomogeneous charge transport.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Jun 2009 15:59:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 7 Aug 2010 05:24:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-10"}
