The relative fluctuations of the density do not depend on the\nreflector size in the investigated size range (from 240 m^2 up to 960 m^2).\nThis implies that a single telescope with a mirror area larger than that of the\nMAGIC telescope cannot achieve better energy resolution than estimated and\npresented in this paper. The correlations between longitudinal and lateral\ndistributions are much more pronounced for primary gamma-ray than for primary\nproton showers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Feb 2009 16:18:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

At low magnetic fields these\ntrilayers exhibit a pronounced magnetoresistance effect. Its dynamic transport\nbehavior is presented through detailed I-V characteristics. More importantly,\nthe detailed evolution of the longitudinal and transverse magnetic components\nof the trilayers is presented from close to well below T . These data clearly\nshow that below T and for low magnetic fields the transport properties of the\nNb interlayer are influenced by transverse stray-fields that motivate\nsubsequent transverse magnetic coupling of the outer Ni Fe layers. By\ngeneralizing this experimental finding we propose that the generic prerequisite\nfor the occurrence of intense magnetoresistance effects in relative trilayers\nis that the coercive fields of the outer ferromagnetic layers should almost\ncoincide since the simultaneous occurrence of magnetic domains all over their\nsurface will promote a transverse magnetic coupling mediated by the\naccompanying transverse stray fields. Finally, the trilayer's upper-critical\nfield exhibits a pronounced suppression for low magnetic fields indicative of a\nbehavior, while for high values the conventional behavior is recovered. A\nsimilar process is observed in both Nb-Ni Fe bilayers and Nb single layers.\nHowever, significant qualitative and quantitative differences exist between\nthese samples. Based on a mechanism that is motivated by longitudinal\nstray-fields existing exclusively in the high-field regime we propose a\npossible interpretation for this experimental finding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Feb 2009 16:56:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-03"}

Computing\nbeamforming vectors relies on quantized channel state information (CSI)\nfeedback (limited feedback) from mobiles. Define the stability region for SDMA\nas the set of multiuser packet-arrival rates for which the steady-state queue\nlengths are finite. Given perfect CSI feedback and equal power allocation over\nscheduled queues, the stability region is proved to be a convex polytope having\nthe derived vertices. For any set of arrival rates in the stability region,\nmultiuser queues are shown to be stabilized by a joint queue-and-beamforming\ncontrol policy that maximizes the departure-rate-weighted sum of queue lengths.\nThe stability region for limited feedback is found to be the perfect-CSI region\nmultiplied by one minus a small factor. The required number of feedback bits\nper mobile is proved to scale logarithmically with the inverse of the above\nfactor as well as linearly with the number of transmit antennas minus one. The\neffects of limited feedback on queueing delay are also quantified. For Poisson\narrival processes, CSI quantization errors are shown to multiply average\nqueueing delay by a factor larger than one. This factor can be controlled by\nadjusting the number of feedback bits per mobile following the derived\nrelationship. For general arrival processes, CSI errors are found to increase\nKingman's bound on the tail probability of the instantaneous delay by one plus\na small factor. The required number of feedback bits per mobile is shown to\nscale logarithmically with this factor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Feb 2009 19:05:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-03"}

In addition,\nwe perform a detailed characterisation of the detected debris discs.\nTheoretically, the mass of the disc is expected to decrease with time. In order\nto test this hypothesis, we performed the generalised Kendall's tau correlation\nand three different two-sample tests. A characterisation of the detected debris\ndiscs has been obtained by computing the collision and Poynting-Robertson\ntimescales and by modelling the spectral energy distribution. The Kendall's tau\ncorrelation yields a probability of 76% that the mass of debris discs and their\nage are correlated. Similarly, the three two-sample tests give a probability\nbetween 70 and 83% that younger and older debris systems belong to different\nparent populations in terms of dust mass. We detected submillimetre/millimetre\nemission from six debris discs, enabling a detailed SED modelling. Our results\non the correlation and evolution of dust mass as a function of age are\nconditioned by the sensitivity limit of our survey. Deeper millimetre\nobservations are needed to confirm the evolution of debris material around\nsolar-like stars. In the case of the detected discs, the comparison between\ncollision and Poynting-Robertson timescales supports the hypothesis that these\ndiscs are collision dominated.

If the nearest major CR source is about a\nkpc away, then low energy electrons ($\\sim 1$ GeV) can easily reach us.

Sink equilibria\nhas been introduced by Goemans, Mirrokni, and Vetta for studying social cost on\nNash dynamics over pure strategies in games. However, they do not address the\ncomplexity of sink equilibria in these games. Recently, Fabrikant and\nPapadimitriou initiated the study of the complexity of Nash dynamics in two\nclasses of games. In order to completely understand the complexity of Nash\ndynamics in a variety of games, we study the following three questions for\nvarious games: (i) given a state in game, can we verify if this state is in a\nsink equilibrium or not? (ii) given an instance of a game, can we verify if\nthere exists any sink equilibrium other than pure Nash equilibria? and (iii)\ngiven an instance of a game, can we verify if there exists a pure Nash\nequilibrium (i.e, a sink equilibrium with one state)?\n  In this paper, we almost answer all of the above questions for a variety of\nclasses of games with succinct representation, including anonymous games,\nplayer-specific and weighted congestion games, valid-utility games, and\ntwo-sided market games. In particular, for most of these problems, we show that\n(i) it is PSPACE-complete to verify if a given state is in a sink equilibrium,\n(ii) it is NP-hard to verify if there exists a pure Nash equilibrium in the\ngame or not, (iii) it is PSPACE-complete to verify if there exists any sink\nequilibrium other than pure Nash equilibria. To solve these problems, we\nillustrate general techniques that could be used to answer similar questions in\nother classes of games.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Feb 2009 21:37:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-04"}

Our observations of HI selected galaxies in the\nlight of H-alpha and the far-ultraviolet (FUV) challenge this notion. The flux\nratio H-alpha/FUV from these two star formation tracers shows strong\ncorrelations with the surface-brightness in H-alpha and the R band: Low Surface\nBrightness (LSB) galaxies have lower ratios compared to High Surface Brightness\ngalaxies and to expectations from equilibrium star formation models using\ncommonly favored IMF parameters. Weaker but significant correlations of\nH-alpha/FUV with luminosity, rotational velocity and dynamical mass are found\nas well as a systematic trend with morphology. The correlated variations of\nH-alpha/FUV with other global parameters are thus part of the larger family of\ngalaxy scaling relations. The H-alpha/FUV correlations can not be due to dust\ncorrection errors, while systematic variations in the star formation history\ncan not explain the trends with both H-alpha and R surface brightness. LSB\ngalaxies are unlikely to have a higher escape fraction of ionizing photons\nconsidering their high gas fraction, and color-magnitude diagrams. The most\nplausible explanation for the correlations are systematic variations of the\nupper mass limit and/or slope of the IMF at the upper end. We outline a\nscenario of pressure driving the correlations by setting the efficiency of the\nformation of the dense star clusters where the highest mass stars form. Our\nresults imply that the star formation rate measured in a galaxy is highly\nsensitive to the tracer used in the measurement. A non-universal IMF also calls\ninto question the interpretation of metal abundance patterns in dwarf galaxies\nand star formation histories derived from color magnitude diagrams.

To quantify this role and facilitate comparisons with\nX-ray observations, we conduct 3D hydrodynamical simulations with the adaptive\nmesh refinement code, FLASH, to investigate the physical properties of hot gas\ninside a galactic bulge, similar to that of our Galaxy or M31. We assume that\nthe dynamical and thermal properties of the hot gas are dominated by mechanical\nenergy input from SNe, primarily Type Ia, and mass injection from evolved stars\nas well as iron enrichment from SNe. We study the bulge-wide outflow as well as\nthe SN heating on scales down to ~4 pc. An embedding scheme that is devised to\nplant individual SNR seeds, allows to examine, for the first time, the effect\nof sporadic SNe on the density, temperature, and iron ejecta distribution of\nthe hot gas as well as the resultant X-ray morphology and spectrum. We find\nthat the SNe produce a bulge wind with highly filamentary density structures\nand patchy ejecta. Compared with a 1D spherical wind model, the non-uniformity\nof simulated gas density, temperature, and metallicity substantially alters the\nspectral shape and increases the diffuse X-ray luminosity. The differential\nemission measure as a function of temperature of the simulated gas exhibits a\nlog-normal distribution, with a peak value much lower than that of the\ncorresponding 1D model. The bulk of the X-ray emission comes from the\nrelatively low temperature and low abundance gas shells associated with SN\nblastwaves. SN ejecta are not well mixed with the ambient medium, at least in\nthe bulge region. These results, at least partly, account for the apparent lack\nof evidence for iron enrichment in the soft X-ray-emitting gas in galactic\nbulges and intermediate-mass elliptical galaxies.[...]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Feb 2009 23:27:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

We employ the Eulerian-Lagrangian\nmethod with two-way coupling and periodic boundary conditions. In order to be\nable to treat up to 288000 bubbles, the following approximations and\nsimplifications had to be introduced: (i) The bubbles were treated as\npoint-particles, thus (ii) disregarding the near-field interactions among them,\nand (iii) effective force models for the lift and the drag forces were used. In\nparticular, the lift coefficient was assumed to be 1/2, independent of the\nbubble Reynolds number and the local flow field. The results suggest that large\nscale motions are generated, owing to an inverse energy cascade from the small\nto the large scales. However, as the Taylor-Reynolds number is only in the\nrange of 1, the corresponding scaling of the energy spectrum with an exponent\nof -5/3 cannot develop over a pronounced range. In the long term, the property\nof local energy transfer, characteristic of real turbulence, is lost and the\ninput of energy equals the viscous dissipation at all scales. Due to the lack\nof strong vortices the bubbles spread rather uniformly in the flow. The\nmechanism for uniform spreading is as follows: Rising bubbles induce a velocity\nfield behind them that acts on the following bubbles. Owing to the shear, those\nbubbles experience a lift force which make them spread to the left or right,\nthus preventing the formation of vertical bubble clusters and therefore of\nefficient forcing. Indeed, when the lift is artifically put to zero in the\nsimulations, the flow is forced much more efficiently and a more pronounced\nenergy accumulates at large scales is achieved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Feb 2009 22:34:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-29"}

In this case, the amplitude\nof the merger and ringdown waveforms is very low, and thus, gravitational waves\nare characterized by the inspiral waveform and subsequent quick damping. The\ndifference in the merger and ringdown waveforms is clearly reflected in the\nspectrum shape and in the \"cut-off\" frequency above which the spectrum\namplitude steeply decreases. When an NS is not tidally disrupted (e.g., for\nQ=5), kick velocity, induced by asymmetric gravitational wave emission, agrees\napproximately with that derived for the merger of BH-BH binaries, whereas for\nthe case that the tidal disruption occurs, the kick velocity is significantly\nsuppressed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Feb 2009 01:25:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 22 Jul 2012 16:22:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-24"}

The new method numerically\nsolves the stochastic differential equation describing the model, rather than\nthe equivalent master equation.

The Monte-Carlo approach is\nillustrated by application to a Gaussian test case, and to the class of\nflare-like models presented in Wheatland (2008), which are steady-state models\nwith constant rates of energy supply, and power-law distributed jump transition\nrates.

They have a projected angular\nseparation of 5.7\", corresponding to 800 AU at the distance of Taurus. To\nassess the nature of these two objects, we have obtained spectra of them and\nhave constructed their spectral energy distributions. Both sources are young\n(~1 Myr) according to their Halpha emission, gravity-sensitive spectral\nfeatures, and mid-IR excess emission. The proper motion of FU Tau A provides\nadditional evidence of its membership in Taurus. We measure spectral types of\nM7.25 and M9.25 for FU Tau A and B, respectively, which correspond to masses of\n~0.05 and ~0.015 M\\cdot according to the evolutionary models of Chabrier and\nBaraffe. FU Tau A is significantly overluminous relative to an isochrone\npassing through FU Tau B and relative to other members of Taurus near its\nspectral type, which may indicate that it is an unresolved binary. FU Tau A and\nB are likely to be components of a binary system based on the low probability\n(~3x10^-4) that Taurus would produce two unrelated brown dwarfs with a\nprojected separation of a </- 6\". Barnard 215 contains only one other young\nstar and is in a remote area of Taurus, making FU Tau A and B the first\nspectroscopically-confirmed brown dwarfs discovered forming in isolation rather\nthan in a stellar cluster or aggregate.

Below this scale, the homology groups\nfluctuate rapidly as a function of the thickening parameter. This provides a\nnecessary though not sufficient criterion to test for manifoldlikeness of a\ncausal set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Feb 2009 06:19:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2009 17:37:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-17"}

We study the evolution of Be in the early\nGalaxy and its dependence on kinematic and orbital parameters. We investigate\nthe formation of the halo and the thick disk of the Galaxy and the use of Be as\na cosmochronometer. Beryllium abundances are determined from high resolution,\nhigh signal to noise UVES spectra with spectrum synthesis in the largest sample\nof halo and thick disk stars analyzed to date. We present our observational\nresults in various diagrams. 1) In a log(Be/H) vs [Fe/H] diagram we find a\nmarginal statistical detection of a real scatter, above what expected from\nmeasurement errors, with a larger scatter among halo stars. The detection of\nthe scatter is further supported by the existence of pairs of stars with\nidentical atmospheric parameters and different Be abundances. 2) In an\nlog(Be/H) vs [alpha/Fe] diagram, the halo stars separate into two components;\none is consistent with predictions of evolutionary models, while the other has\ntoo high alpha and Be abundances and is chemically indistinguishable from thick\ndisk stars. This suggests that the halo is not a single uniform population\nwhere a clear age-metallicity relation can be defined. 3) In diagrams of Rmin\nvs [alpha/Fe] and log(Be/H) the thick disk stars show a possible decrease of\n[alpha/Fe] with Rmin, whereas no dependence of Be with Rmin is seen.

We\nstudy in detail three different classes of inflationary models, chaotic, hybrid\nmodels and hilltop models, and discuss their embedding into supersymmetric\nmodels and the consequences for model building of the warm inflationary\ndynamics based on first principles calculations. Due to the extra friction term\nintroduced in the inflaton background evolution generated by the dissipative\ndynamics, inflation can take place generically for smaller values of the field,\nand larger values of couplings and masses. When the dissipative dynamics\ndominates over the expansion, in the so-called strong dissipative regime,\ninflation proceeds with sub-planckian inflaton values. Models can be naturally\nembedded into a supergravity framework, with sugra corrections suppressed by\nthe Planck mass now under control, for a larger class of K\\\"ahler potentials.\nIn particular, this provides a simpler solution to the \"eta\" problem in\nsupersymmetric hybrid inflation, without restricting the K\\\"ahler potentials\ncompatible with inflation. For chaotic models dissipation leads to a smaller\nprediction for the tensor-to-scalar ratio and a less tilted spectrum when\ncompared to the cold inflation scenario. We find in particular that a small\ncomponent of dissipation renders the quartic model now consistent with the\ncurrent CMB data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Feb 2009 14:46:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-21"}

The main application is for systems\ninvolving a Wolf-Rayet (WR) star and an OB star companion. The WR wind is\nassumed to dominate the forbidden line emission. The colliding wind interaction\nis treated as an archimedean spiral with an inner boundary. Under the\nassumptions of the model, the major findings are as follows. (a) The\nredistribution of the WR wind as a result of the wind collision is not flux\nconservative but typically produces an excess of line emission; however, this\nexcess is modest at around the 10% level. (b) Deviations from a flat-top\nprofile shape for a spherical wind are greatest for viewing inclinations that\nare more nearly face-on to the orbital plane. At intermediate viewing\ninclinations, profiles display only mild deviations from a flat-top shape. (c)\nThe profile shape can be used to constrain the colliding wind bow shock opening\nangle. (d) Structure in the line profile tends to be suppressed in binaries of\nshorter periods. (e) Obtaining data for multiple forbidden lines is important\nsince different lines probe different characteristic radial scales. Our models\nare discussed in relation to ISO data for WR 147 and gamma Vel (WR11). The\nlines for WR 147 are probably not accurate enough to draw firm conclusions. For\ngamma Vel, individual line morphologies are broadly reproducible but not\nsimultaneously so for the claimed wind and orbital parameters. Overall, the\neffort demonstrates how lines that are sensitive to the large-scale wind can\nhelp to deduce binary system properties and provide new tests of numerical\nsimulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Feb 2009 15:10:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2009 18:14:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Our systematic\nmagnetotransport measurements of polycrystalline SmFeAsO$_{1-x}$F$_x$ at\ndifferent doping levels confirm the upward curvature of the upper critical\nmagnetic field $H_{c2}(T)$ as a function of temperature $T$ defining the phase\nboundary between the superconducting and metallic states for crystallites with\nthe ab planes oriented nearly perpendicular to the magnetic field. We further\nshow from measurements on single crystals that this feature, which was\ninterpreted in terms of the existence of two superconducting gaps, is\nubiquitous among both series of single and double layered compounds. In all\ncompounds explored by us the zero temperature upper critical field $H_{c2}(0)$,\nestimated either through the Ginzburg-Landau or the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg\nsingle gap theories, strongly surpasses the weak coupling Pauli paramagnetic\nlimiting field. This clearly indicates the strong coupling nature of the\nsuperconducting state and the importance of magnetic correlations for these\nmaterials. Our measurements indicate that the superconducting anisotropy, as\nestimated through the ratio of the effective masses $\\gamma =\n(m_c/m_{ab})^{1/2}$ for carriers moving along the c-axis and the ab planes,\nrespectively, is relatively modest as compared to the high-$T_c$ cuprates, but\nit is temperature, field and even doping dependent. Finally, our preliminary\nestimations of the irreversibility field $H_m(T)$, separating the vortex-solid\nfrom the vortex-liquid phase in the single layered compounds, indicates that it\nis well described by the melting of a vortex lattice in a moderately\nanisotropic uniaxial superconductor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Feb 2009 15:43:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Feb 2009 20:03:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}
