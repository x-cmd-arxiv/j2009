The identification\nof an oscillation at ~ 30 Hz as the fundamental crustal shear mode requires a\nnuclear symmetry energy that depends very weakly on density near saturation. If\nthe nuclear symmetry energy varies more strongly with density, then lower\nfrequency oscillations, previously identified as torsional Alfven modes of the\nfluid core, could instead be associated with the crust. If this is the case,\nthen future observations of giant flares should detect oscillations at around\n18 Hz.

The importance of the latter component\ndecreases with galaxy mass. Individual objects, on the other hand, have clearly\nrevealed that the dark halos encompassing the luminous discs have a constant\ndensity core.

We combine a simple theory for electron\ncooling in SNRs with the observed radio luminosities to estimate the remnant\nmagnetic field strength (B_SNR): the correlation between L and Sigma implies\nthat B_SNR also increases with Sigma. We explore two interpretations of this\ncorrelation: (1) B_SNR is generated by post-shock magnetic field amplification,\nwith B_SNR^2 proportional to Sigma and (2) B_SNR results from shock-compression\nof the ambient ISM magnetic field (B_ISM), with B_ISM being larger in denser\ngalaxies. We find that shock compression is, on average, sufficient to produce\nthe observed radio emission from SNRs in the densest starbursts; amplification\nof post-shock magnetic fields is not required. By contrast, in normal spirals\npost-shock field amplification (by a factor of a few - 10) is consistent with\nthe data; we find tentative evidence that both the Alfven speed and the ratio\nof B_SNR^2 to the post-shock pressure (\"epsilon_B\") are constant in SNRs from\ngalaxy to galaxy. We discuss observational tests that can be used to\ndistinguish between these two interpretations of the radio luminosities of\nSNRs. Regardless of which is correct, the radio emission from SNRs provides an\nupper limit to B_ISM that is independent of the minimum energy assumption. For\nthe densest starbursts, the ISM magnetic energy density is below that required\nfor hydrostatic equilibrium; thus magnetic fields are not dynamically important\non the largest scales in starbursts, in contrast with spiral galaxies like our\nown.

The present paper aims at characterizing the continuuum\nproperties of this sample of objects. We cross-correlated 1.2 mm continuum data\nfrom SIMBA@SEST with Spitzer/GLIMPSE images to establish the connection between\nemission sources at millimeter wavelengths and the IRDCs we see at 8 $\\mu$m in\nabsorption against the bright PAH background.

Partitions are dual to subsets so there is a dual\nlogic of partitions where a \"distinction\" [an ordered pair of distinct elements\n(u,u') from the universe U ] is dual to an \"element\". An element being in a\nsubset is analogous to a partition p on U making a distinction, i.e., if u and\nu' were in different blocks of p. Subset logic leads to finite probability\ntheory by taking the (Laplacian) probability as the normalized size of each\nsubset-event of a finite universe. The analogous step in the logic of\npartitions is to assign to a partition the number of distinctions made by a\npartition normalized by the total number of ordered pairs |UxU| from the finite\nuniverse.

Entropy is of great interest because it controls ICM global properties\nand records the thermal history of a cluster. Entropy is therefore a useful\nquantity for studying the effects of feedback on the cluster environment and\ninvestigating any breakdown of cluster self-similarity. We find that most ICM\nentropy profiles are well-fit by a model which is a power-law at large radii\nand approaches a constant value at small radii: K(r) = K0 + K100(r/100 kpc),\nwhere K0 quantifies the typical excess of core entropy above the best fitting\npower-law found at larger radii. We also show that the K0 distributions of both\nthe full archival sample and the primary HIFLUGCS sample of Reiprich (2001) are\nbimodal with a distinct gap between K0 ~ 30 - 50 keV cm^2 and population peaks\nat K0 ~ 15 keV cm^2 and K0 ~ 150 keV cm^2. The effects of PSF smearing and\nangular resolution on best-fit K0 values are investigated using mock Chandra\nobservations and degraded entropy profiles, respectively. We find that neither\nof these effects is sufficient to explain the entropy-profile flattening we\nmeasure at small radii. The influence of profile curvature and number of radial\nbins on best-fit K0 is also considered, and we find no indication K0 is\nsignificantly impacted by either.

In previous works, we developed analysis\ntechniques enabling the study of the applicability of rule sequences, their\nindependence, state reachability and the minimal graph able to fire a sequence.\n  In the present paper we improve our framework in two ways. First, we make\nexplicit (in the form of a Boolean matrix) some negative implicit information\nin rules. This matrix (called nihilation matrix) contains the elements that, if\npresent, forbid the application of the rule (i.e. potential dangling edges, or\nnewly added edges, which cannot be already present in the simple digraph).\nSecond, we introduce a novel notion of application condition, which combines\ngraph diagrams together with monadic second order logic. This allows for more\nflexibility and expressivity than previous approaches, as well as more concise\nconditions in certain cases. We demonstrate that these application conditions\ncan be embedded into rules (i.e. in the left hand side and the nihilation\nmatrix), and show that the applicability of a rule with arbitrary application\nconditions is equivalent to the applicability of a sequence of plain rules\nwithout application conditions. Therefore, the analysis of the former is\nequivalent to the analysis of the latter, showing that in our framework no\nadditional results are needed for the study of application conditions.\nMoreover, all analysis techniques of [21, 22] for the study of sequences can be\napplied to application conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Feb 2009 06:53:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2009 07:30:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-16"}

In cavity QED, the observation of the vacuum Rabi mode\nsplitting is a hallmark experiment aimed at probing the nature of matter-light\ninteraction on the level of a single quantum.

A grid of TLUSTY\nmodels was used to obtain the stellar parameters, and the wind parameters were\ndetermined by using the CMFGEN code. We found that the spectra have mainly a\nphotospheric origin. A weak wind signature is seen in CIV 1549, from where\nmass-loss rates consistent with previous CMFGEN results regarding O8-9V stars\nwere obtained. A discrepancy of roughly 2 orders of magnitude is found between\nthese mass-loss rates and the values predicted by theory (Mdot(Vink)),\nconfirming a breakdown or a steepening of the modified wind momentum-luminosity\nrelation at log L/Lsun < 5.2. We have estimated the carbon abundance for the\nstars of our sample and concluded that its uncertainty cannot cause the weak\nwind problem. Upper limits on Mdot were established for all objects using lines\nof different ions, namely, PV 1118,28, CIII 1176, NV 1239,43, Si IV 1394,03,\nand NIV 1718. All the values obtained are also in disagreement with theoretical\npredictions, bringing support to the reality of weak winds. Together with CIV\n1549, the use of NV 1239,43 results in the lowest mass-loss rates: the upper\nlimits indicate that Mdot must be less than about -1.0 dex Mdot(Vink).\nRegarding the other transitions, the upper limits still point to low rates:\nMdot must be less than about $(-0.5 \\pm 0.2)$ dex Mdot(Vink). We have studied\nthe behavior of the Halpha line with different mass-loss rates. We have also\nexplored ways to fit the observed spectra with Mdot(Vink).

We add to this picture by showing that the natural\ndecision versions of all problems in two prominent classes of constant-factor\napproximable problems, namely MIN F^+\\Pi_1 and MAX NP, admit polynomial problem\nkernels. Problems in MAX SNP, a subclass of MAX NP, are shown to admit kernels\nwith a linear base set, e.g., the set of vertices of a graph.

Normally a term due to the inclusion of\nthe wavelength derivative in the Lagrangian equation of radiative transfer is\nassociated with a generalised opacity. In non-monotonic velocity fields, this\ngeneralised opacity may become negative. To ensure that the opacity remains\npositive, this term of the derivative is included in the formal solution of the\nradiative transfer problem.\n  The new definition of the generalised opacity allows for a new solution of\nthe equation of radiative transfer in the presence of velocity fields. It is\nespecially useful for arbitrary velocity fields, where it effectively prevents\nthe occurrences of negative generalised opacities and still allows the explicit\nconstruction of the Lambda-operator of the system needed for an accelerated\nLambda-iteration. We performed test calculations, where the results of old,\nestablished solutions were compared with the new solution. The relative\ndeviations never exceeded 1% and so the new solution is indeed suitable for use\nin radiative-transfer modelling. Non-monotonic velocity fields along photon\npaths frequently occur in three-dimensional hydrodynamical models of\nastrophysical atmospheres. Therefore, the formal solution will be of use for\nmultidimensional radiative transfer and has immediate applications in the\nmodelling of pulsating stars and astrophysical shock fronts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Feb 2009 12:51:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Massive stars in\nnewly formed or primordial globular clusters could have played an important\nrole during the epoch of cosmological reionisation (z>~6) as sources of\nenergetic, neutral hydrogen ionising UV photons. We investigate whether or not\nthese stars could have been as important in death as sources of energetic X-ray\nphotons as they were during their main sequence lives. Most massive stars are\nexpected to form in binaries, and an appreciable fraction of these (as much as\n~30%) will evolve into X-ray luminous (L_X~10^38 erg/s) high-mass X-ray\nbinaries (HMXBs). These sources would have made a contribution to the X-ray\nbackground at z>~6. Using Monte Carlo models of a globular cluster, we estimate\nthe total X-ray luminosity of a population of HMXBs. We compare and contrast\nthis with the total UV luminosity of the massive stars during their main\nsequence lives. For reasonable estimates, we find that the bolometric\nluminosity of the cluster peaks at ~10^42 erg/s during the first few million\nyears, but declines to ~10^41 erg/s after ~5 million years as the most massive\nstars evolve off the main sequence. From this time onwards, the total\nbolometric luminosity is dominated by HMXBs and falls gradually to ~10^40 erg/s\nafter ~50 million years. Assuming a power-law spectral energy distribution for\nthe HMXBs, we calculate the effective number of neutral hydrogen ionisations\nper HMXB and show that HMXBs can be as important as sources of ionising\nradiation as massive stars. Finally we discuss the implications of our results\nfor modelling galaxy formation at high redshift and the prospects of using\nglobular clusters as probes of reionisation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Feb 2009 14:27:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Then we perform a numerical simulation of a collapsar using a\nrealistic progenitor model. It is shown that a jet is launched from the center\nof the progenitor. We also find that the mass accretion rate after the launch\nof the jet shows rapid time variability that resembles to a typical time\nprofile of a GRB. The structure of the jet is similar to the previous study: a\npoynting flux jet is surrounded by a funnel-wall jet. Even at the final stage\nof the simulation, bulk Lorentz factor of the jet is still low, and total\nenergy of the jet is still as small as 10^48 erg. However, we find that the\nenergy flux per unit rest-mass flux is as high as 10^2 at the bottom of the\njet. Thus we conclude that the bulk Lorentz factor of the jet can be\npotentially high when it propagates outward. It is shown that the outgoing\npoynting flux exists at the horizon around the polar region, which proves that\nthe Blandford-Znajek mechanism is working.
