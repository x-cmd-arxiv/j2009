In particular, a model is studied in which a\nrelay station simultaneously assists two transmitters in multicasting their\nindependent messages to two receivers. The relay may also have an independent\nmessage of its own to multicast. As a first step to address this general model,\nreferred to as the compound multiple access channel with a relay (cMACr), the\ncapacity region of the multiple access channel with a \"cognitive\" relay is\ncharacterized, including the cases of partial and rate-limited cognition. Then,\nachievable rate regions for the cMACr model are presented based on\ndecode-and-forward (DF) and compress-and-forward (CF) relaying strategies.\nMoreover, an outer bound is derived for the special case, called the cMACr\nwithout cross-reception, in which each transmitter has a direct link to one of\nthe receivers while the connection to the other receiver is enabled only\nthrough the relay terminal. The capacity region is characterized for a binary\nmodulo additive cMACr without cross-reception, showing the optimality of binary\nlinear block codes, thus highlighting the benefits of physical layer network\ncoding and structured codes. Results are extended to the Gaussian channel model\nas well, providing achievable rate regions for DF and CF, as well as for a\nstructured code design based on lattice codes.

Strong gravitational lensing furnishes a powerful method to probe\ngravity in the central regions of galaxies. It can (1) provide a unique\ndetection-channel of dark-matter substructure beyond the local galaxy group,\n(2) constrain dark-matter physics, complementary to direct-detection\nexperiments, as well as metric theories of gravity, (3) probe central\nsuper-massive black holes, and (4) provide crucial insight into galaxy\nformation processes from the dark matter point of view, independently of the\nnature and state of dark matter. To seriously address the above questions, a\nconsiderable increase in the number of strong gravitational-lens systems is\nrequired. In the timeframe 2010-2020, a staged approach with radio (e.g. EVLA,\ne-MERLIN, LOFAR, SKA phase-I) and optical (e.g. LSST and JDEM) instruments can\nprovide 10^(2-4) new lenses, and up to 10^(4-6) new lens systems from\nSKA/LSST/JDEM all-sky surveys around ~2020. Follow-up imaging of (radio) lenses\nis necessary with moderate ground/space-based optical-IR telescopes and with\n30-50m telescopes for spectroscopy (e.g. TMT, GMT, ELT). To answer these\nfundamental questions through strong gravitational lensing, a strong investment\nin large radio and optical-IR facilities is therefore critical in the coming\ndecade. In particular, only large-scale radio lens surveys (e.g. with SKA)\nprovide the large numbers of high-resolution and high-fidelity images of lenses\nneeded for SMBH and flux-ratio anomaly studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Feb 2009 16:30:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 Feb 2009 17:38:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-21"}

However, analyses commonly used to retrieve\n$L$ ignore microcavity effects that may induce a strong modulation of the\nemitted light as the position of the exciton probe is shifted. The present\npaper investigates in detail how this technique may be improved to obtain more\naccurate results for L. The example of 4,4'-bis(carbazol-9-yl)1,1'-biphenyl\n(CBP) is taken, for which a triplet diffusion length of L=16 +/- 4 nm (at 3\nmA/cm2) is inferred from experiments. The influence of triplet-triplet\nannihilation, responsible for an apparent decrease of L at high current\ndensities, is theoretically investigated, as well as the 'invasiveness' of the\nthin probe layer on the exciton distribution. The interplay of microcavity\neffects and direct recombinations is demonstrated experimentally with the\narchetypal trilayer structure\n[N,N'-bis(naphthalen-1-yl)-N,N'-bis(phenyl)]-4,4'-diaminobiphenyl (NPB)/CBP/\n2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (named bathocuproine, BCP). It is\nshown that in this device holes do cross the NPB/CBP junction, without the\nassistance of electrons and despite the high energetic barrier imposed by the\nshift between the HOMO levels. The use of the variable-thickness doped layer\ntechnique in this case is then discussed. Finally, some guidelines are given\nfor improving the measure of the diffusion length of triplet excitons in\noperational OLEDs, applicable to virtually any small molecular-weight material.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Feb 2009 16:50:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

We highlight\nthe importance of distances and model independent distances and masses.\n  Distances are fundamental in astrophysics and their knowledge can change our\nperception of phenomena dramatically: e.g., in antiquity, the Heliocentric\nmodel was rejected because the predicted stellar parallaxes were not observed.\n  Distance measurements are directly related to the history & fate of the uni-\nverse as they provide 2 of 3 methods available to date the universe. The 1st\nmethod is based on the ages of stars, which can be ascertained if their lumi-\nnosities (distances) are accurately known. The 2nd method relies on cosmolo-\ngical methods. To 1st order, the age of the universe is the inverse H_0.\n  As stressed by the previous decadal report, \"the fundamental goal of ...\nastrophysics is to understand how the universe ... galaxies [and] stars ...\nformed, how they evolved, and what their destiny will be.\" These questions can\nbe answered partly by micro-arcsecond astrometry: 1) Galactic archeology: a\ndetailed reconstruction of the formation history of the Milky Way and other\nLocal Group galaxies, 2) the very oldest stars in the Milky Way and the age of\nthe Universe, and 3) H_0 and concordance cosmology.\n  These goals are achievable by combining muas-arcsecond astrometry from the\nproposed SIM-Lite mission supplemented with ground-based spectroscopy. The\nresults of our proposed project will force the biggest reassessment of stellar\nastrophysics in 50 years, which will affect most branches of astrophysics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Feb 2009 17:20:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-19"}

Equipping the macrocell and femtocells with multiple\nantennas enhances robustness against the near-far problem. This work derives\nthe maximum number of simultaneously transmitting multiple antenna femtocells\nmeeting a per-tier outage probability constraint. Coverage dead zones are\npresented wherein cross-tier interference bottlenecks cellular and hotspot\ncoverage. Two operating regimes are shown namely 1) a cellular-limited regime\nin which femtocell users experience unacceptable cross-tier interference and 2)\na hotspot-limited regime wherein both femtocell users and cellular users are\nlimited by hotspot interference. Our analysis accounts for the per-tier\ntransmit powers, the number of transmit antennas (single antenna transmission\nbeing a special case) and terrestrial propagation such as the Rayleigh fading\nand the path loss exponents. Single-user (SU) multiple antenna transmission at\neach tier is shown to provide significantly superior coverage and spatial reuse\nrelative to multiuser (MU) transmission. We propose a decentralized\ncarrier-sensing approach to regulate femtocell transmission powers based on\ntheir location.

The IRS\nspectrum shows a bump around ~11mu and an increase towards longer wavelengths,\nreminiscent of silicate emission.

In almost all galaxies in our sample the specific\nSFR (SFR per unit stellar mass) of the bulge is higher than that of the outer\ndisk, suggesting that almost all galaxies are increasing their B/T through\ninternal star formation. In pseudobulges, SFR density correlates, positvely,\nwith mass density, this is consistent with that stellar mass being formed by\nmoderate, extended star fromation.

We carry out cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations\nof Population III (Pop III) starbursts in a 10^8 M_Sun dwarf galaxy at z =\n12.5. For different star formation efficiencies and stellar initial mass\nfunctions (IMFs), we calculate the luminosities and equivalent widths (EWs) of\nthe recombination lines H_alpha, Ly_alpha, and He II 1640, under the simple\nassumption that the stellar population does not evolve over the first ~3 Myr of\nthe starburst. Although only < 40 percent of the gas in the central 100 pc of\nthe galaxy is photoionized, we find that photoheating by massive stars causes a\nstrong dynamical response, which results in a weak correlation between\nluminosity emitted in hydrogen recombination lines and the total mass in stars.\nHowever, owing to the low escape fraction of He II-ionizing photons, the\nluminosity emitted in He II 1640 is much more strongly correlated with the\ntotal stellar mass. The ratio of the luminosity in He II 1640 to that in\nLy_alpha or H_alpha is found to be a good indicator of the IMF in many cases.\nThe ratio of observable fluxes is F_1640/F_Halpha ~ 1 for clusters of 100 M_Sun\nPop III stars and F_1640/F_Halpha ~ 0.1 for clusters of 25 M_Sun Pop III stars.\nThe EW of the He II 1640 emission line is the most reliable IMF indicator, its\nvalue varying between ~ 20 and ~ 200 angstrom for a massive and very massive\nPop III IMF, respectively. Even the bright, initial stages of Pop III\nstarbursts in the first dwarf galaxies will likely not be directly detectable\nby the JWST. Instead, the JWST may discover only more massive, and hence more\nchemically evolved, galaxies which host normal, Pop I/II, star formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Feb 2009 21:51:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2009 16:29:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Several linear-time algorithms are known for\nbounded expansion classes (such as subgraph isomorphism testing), and they\nallow restricted homomorphism dualities, amongst other desirable properties. In\nthis paper we establish two new characterisations of bounded expansion classes,\none in terms of so-called topological parameters, the other in terms of\ncontrolling dense parts. The latter characterisation is then used to show that\nthe notion of bounded expansion is compatible with Erd\\\"os-R\\'enyi model of\nrandom graphs with constant average degree. In particular, we prove that for\nevery fixed $d>0$, there exists a class with bounded expansion, such that a\nrandom graph of order $n$ and edge probability $d/n$ asymptotically almost\nsurely belongs to the class. We then present several new examples of classes\nwith bounded expansion that do not exclude some topological minor, and appear\nnaturally in the context of graph drawing or graph colouring.

Neutrinos travel\nfrom their source undeflected by magnetic fields and unimpeded by interactions\nwith the cosmic microwave background.

Apart from clarifying various issues of supergeometry which\nsometimes remain obscure in the standard (ringed-space) approach, its main\nachievement is that it makes infinite-dimensional supermanifolds available.\n  We use this to define the supermanifold of all almost complex structures on a\ngiven finite-dimensional supermanifold and show that it actually carries a\ncomplex structure itself.

In\nrelaxed clusters, we find two distinct sets of shocks.

Another set of\nstronger shocks (\"external shocks\") is located farther out, at about 3 Rvir,\nwith large Mach numbers (~100), covering about 40-60% of the surface area. We\nsimulate SZ surface brightness maps of relaxed massive galaxy clusters drawn\nfrom high resolution AMR runs, and conclude that ALMA should be capable of\ndetecting the virial shocks in massive clusters of galaxies.

I\npresent a conceptually new approach to mitigation of RFI in interferometric\ndata. This has been used to develop a software tool (RfiX) to remove RFI from\nobservations using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope, India. However, the\nconcept can be used to excise RFI in any interferometer. Briefly, the\nfringe-stopped correlator output of an interferometer baseline oscillates with\nthe fringe-stop period in the presence of RFI. RfiX works by identifying such a\npattern and subtracting it from the data. It is perhaps the only purely\nsoftware technique which can salvage the true visibility value from\nRFI-corrupted data. It neither requires high-speed hardware nor real-time\nprocessing and works best on normal correlator output integrated for 1-10s. It\ncomplements other mitigation schemes with its different approach and the regime\nit addresses. Its ability to work with data integrated over many seconds gives\nit an advantage while excising weak, persistent RFI unlike most other\ntechniques which use high-speed sampling to localise RFI in time-frequency\nplane. RfiX is also different in that it does not require RFI-free data to\nidentify corrupted sections. Some results from the application of RfiX is\npresented including an image at 240 MHz with a Peak/noise ratio of 43000, the\nhighest till date at wavelengths >1m.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Feb 2009 09:34:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

About\nhalf of the sample are QSOs in the optical, while the remaining sources are\ngalaxies, comprising both obscured AGN and starbursts. We classify the spectra\nusing well-known infrared diagnostics, as well as a new one that we propose,\ninto three types of source: those dominated by an unobscured AGN (QSOs),\nobscured AGN, and starburst-dominated sources. Starbursts concentrate at z ~\n0.6-1.0 favored by the shift of the 7.7-micron PAH band into the selection 15\nmicron band, while AGN spread over the 0.5 < z < 3.1 range. Star formation\nrates (SFR) are estimated for individual sources from the luminosity of the PAH\nfeatures. An estimate of the average PAH luminosity in QSOs and obscured AGN is\nobtained from the composite spectrum of all sources with reliable redshifts.\nThe estimated mean SFR in the QSOs is 50-100 Mo yr^-1, but the implied FIR\nluminosity is 3-10 times lower than that obtained from stacking analysis of the\nFIR photometry, suggesting destruction of the PAH carriers by energetic photons\nfrom the AGN. The SFR estimated in obscured AGN is 2-3 times higher than in\nQSOs of similar MIR luminosity. This discrepancy might not be due to luminosity\neffects or selection bias alone, but could instead indicate a connection\nbetween obscuration and star formation. However, the observed correlation\nbetween silicate absorption and the slope of the near- to mid-infrared spectrum\nis compatible with the obscuration of the AGN emission in these sources being\nproduced in a dust torus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Feb 2009 14:39:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Properties of the time histories of\nthe observed events, as well as results of multi-channel spectral analysis,\nboth in the 20--300 keV energy range, show, that the source exhibits itself as\na typical SGR. The bursts durations are <0.75 s and their spectra above 20 keV\ncan be fitted by optically-thin thermal bremsstrahlung (OTTB) model with kT of\n20--40 keV. The spectral evolution is observed, which resembles the SGR 1627-41\nbursts, where a strong hardness-intensity correlation was noticed in the\nearlier Konus-Wind observations. The peak energy fluxes of all five events are\ncomparable to highest those for known SGRs, so a less distant source is\nimplied, consistent with the determined Galactic anti-center direction.\nSupposing the young supernova remnant HB9 (at the distance of 1.5 kpc) as a\nnatal environment of the source, the peak luminosities of the bursts are\nestimated to be (2--5)x10^{40} erg s-1.

Analysis reveals that the evolution of the\nstellar population properties of red-sequence galaxies depend on their mass:\nwhile the properties of most massive are well described by passive evolution\nand high-redshift formation, the less massive galaxies require a more extended\nstar formation history. We show that these scenarios reproduce the index-sigma\nrelations as well as the galaxy colours.
