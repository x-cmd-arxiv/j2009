In a\nclassical BCS superconductor they are established simultaneously at Tc. In the\ncuprates, however, an energy gap (pseudogap) extends above Tc. The origin of\nthis gap is one of the central issues in high temperature superconductivity.\nRecent experimental evidence demonstrates that the pseudogap and the\nsuperconducting gap are associated with different energy scales. It is however\nnot clear whether they coexist independently or compete. In order to understand\nthe physics of cuprates and improve their superconducting properties it is\nvital to determine whether the pseudogap is friend or foe of high temperature\nsupercondctivity. Here we report evidence from angle resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy (ARPES) that the pseudogap and high temperature superconductivity\nrepresent two competing orders. We find that there is a direct correlation\nbetween a loss in the low energy spectral weight due to the pseudogap and a\ndecrease of the coherent fraction of paired electrons. Therefore, the pseudogap\ncompetes with the superconductivity by depleting the spectral weight available\nfor pairing in the region of momentum space where the superconducting gap is\nlargest. This leads to a very unusual state in the underdoped cuprates, where\nonly part of the Fermi surface develops coherence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Feb 2009 20:15:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-10"}

Here $A$ is defined by\n$A_{ij} = 1$ ($A_{ij} = 0$) if there is (is not) a directed network link to $i$\nfrom $j$. However, in at least two recent problems involving networks with\nheterogeneous node properties (percolation on a directed network and the\nstability of Boolean models of gene networks), an analogous but different\neigenvalue problem arises, namely, that of finding the largest eigenvalue\n$\\lambda_Q$ of the matrix $Q$, where $Q_{ij} = q_i A_{ij}$ and the `bias' $q_i$\nmay be different at each node $i$.

In addition, we compute Alfven oscillation frequencies along\nindividual magnetic field lines with a semi-analytic approach, employing a\nshort-wavelength approximation. Our main findings are as follows: a) we confirm\nthe existence of two families of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), with\nharmonics at integer multiples of the fundamental frequency, as was found in\nthe linear study of Sotani, Kokkotas & Stergioulas; b) the QPOs appearing near\nthe magnetic axis are split into two groups, depending on their symmetry across\nthe equatorial plane.

This agreement will allow for a comprehensive study of\nAlfven QPOs for a larger number of different models, without the need for\ntime-consuming simulations.

The\nelectron wavefunction is calculated by solving this equation in a closed finite\nP-space volume. This approach is free of self-energy function and memory term\nand beyond the wide-band limit (WBL). The feasibility and power of the approach\nare demonstrated by the calculation of current through one-dimensional (1D)\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Feb 2009 18:34:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-10"}

The peak\nintensity ratio between G-band and D-band is highly sensitive to the presence\nof the substrate and varies by one order of magnitude, demonstrating the much\nhigher defect density in the supported CNT segments.

Our simulations have high resolution in mass and\nspace which, for the first time, makes it feasible to follow the orbital decay\nof a MBH either counter- or co-rotating with respect to the circumnuclear disc.\nWe show that a moving MBH on an initially counter-rotating orbit experiences an\n\"orbital angular momentum flip\" due to the gas-dynamical friction, i.e., it\nstarts to corotate with the disc before a MBH binary forms.

The spectrum can be fitted with a highly\nabsorbed hard X-ray component from an optically-thin hot plasma, a Gaussian\nemission line with an energy of 6.1 keV and a less absorbed soft thermal\ncomponent. The best fit is obtained with a model in which the hot component is\nproduced by optically thin thermal emission from an isobaric cooling flow with\na maximum temperature of 61 keV, which might be created inside an\noptically-thin boundary layer on the surface of the accreting with dwarf. The\nderived parameters of the hard component detected in MWC 560 are in good\nagreement with similar objects as CH Cyg, SS7317, RT Cru and T CrB, which all\nform a new sub-class of symbiotic stars emitting hard X-rays. Our previous\nnumerical simulations of the jet in MWC 560 showed that it should produce\ndetectable soft X-ray emission. We infer a temperature of 0.17 keV for the\nobserved soft component, i.e. less than expected from our models. The total\nsoft X-ray flux (i.e. at < 3 keV) is more than a factor 100 less than predicted\nfor the propagating jet soon after its birth (<0.3 yr), but consistent with the\nvalue expected due its decrease with age. The ROSAT upper limit is also\nconsistent with such a decrease. We find aperiodic or quasi-periodic\nvariability on timescales of minutes and hours, but no periodic rapid\nvariability.

For two X-ray luminous clusters at redshift z ~ 0.3 with opposite\nX-ray morphologies, RXCJ0014.3-3022 and RXCJ2308.3-0211, we assess differences\nin galaxy populations as a function of cluster topography.

A spectral index analysis is performed, based on the [OII] and\nHdelta features, and the D4000 break, available for more than 100 member\ngalaxies per cluster. Combination of spectral indices and FUV-optical colours\nprovides a picture of the star formation history in galaxies. In spite of the\npotential presence of a small fraction of galaxies with obscured star formation\nactivity, the average star-formation history of cluster members is found to\ndepend on cluster-centric distance and on substructure. There is a sharp\nincrease in star formation activity along two well-defined filamentary\nstructures of the merging cluster RXCJ0014.3-3022, out to its virial radius and\nbeyond, produced by luminous (L ~ L*) and sub-L* galaxies.

Our simulations show that for Comptonization of disk and CMB\nphotons, the degree of polarization of the scattered photons increases with the\nviewing inclination angle with respect to the jet axis. In both cases the\nmaximum linear polarization is approximately 20%. In the case of synchrotron\nself-Comptonization (SSC), we find that the resulting X-ray polarization\ndepends strongly on the seed synchrotron photon injection site, with typical\nfractional polarizations of approximately P = 10 - 20% when synchrotron\nemission is localized near the jet base, while P = 20 - 70% for the case of\nuniform emission throughout the jet. These results indicate that X-ray\npolarimetry may be capable of providing unique clues to identify the location\nof particle acceleration sites in relativistic jets. In particular, if\nsynchrotron photons are emitted quasi-uniformly throughout a jet, then the\nobserved degree of X-ray polarization may be sufficiently different for each of\nthe competing X-ray emission mechanisms (synchrotron, SSC or external\nComptonization) to determine which is the dominant process.

We investigate the viability\nof these black holes as astrophysical objects and try to provide some means to\ndistinguish them from black holes in General Relativity. We start by extending\nprevious works and establishing the stability of these black holes against\naxial perturbations. We then look for solutions of the field equations\ndescribing slowly rotating black holes and study geodesic motion around this\ngeometry. Depending on the values of mass, dilaton charge and angular momentum\nof the solution, one can have measurable differences in the ISCO location and\norbital frequency, relatively to black holes in General Relativity. Such\ndifferences may be useful in future experiments, to discriminate between\nalternative theories of gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Feb 2009 01:26:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Feb 2009 16:47:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2009 14:43:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-11"}

The large scatter in CO intensities for a given HI intensity\npersists even when averaging on scales of >200 pc, indicating that the scatter\nis not solely due to local conversion of HI into H_2 near GMCs. We focus on two\npossibilities to account for this scatter: either there exist spatial\nvariations in the I(CO) to N(H_2) conversion factor, or a significant fraction\nof the atomic gas is not involved in molecular cloud formation. A weak tendency\nfor CO emission to be suppressed for large HI linewidths supports the second\nhypothesis, insofar as large linewidths may be indicative of warm HI, and calls\ninto question the likelihood of forming molecular clouds from colliding HI\nflows. We also find that the ratio of molecular to atomic gas shows no\nsignificant correlation (or anti-correlation) with the stellar surface density,\nthough a correlation with midplane hydrostatic pressure P_h is found when the\ndata are binned in P_h.

This connective tissue comprises repeated units of\ntwo main structures, namely collagens as well as axial, parallel and regular\nanionic glycosaminoglycan between collagens. The collagen fibril can be modeled\nby Hooke's law whereas anionic glycosaminoglycan behaves more like a\nrubber-band rod and as such can be better modeled by the worm-like chain model.\nWhile both computer simulations and continuum mechanics models have been\ninvestigated the behavior of this connective tissue typically, authors either\nassume a simple form of the molecular potential energy or entirely ignore the\nmicroscopic structure of the connective tissue.

In the original article, the\nWKB approximation was used for the modes that are globally stationary. In a\nprevious article, we found that the WKB quantization rule together with a\nproper counting of the states, leads to a new expression of the scalar field\nentropy which is not proportional to the area of the horizon. The expression of\nthe entropy is logarithmically divergent in the brick wall cut-off parameter in\ncontrast to an inverse power divergence obtained earlier. In this article, we\nwill consider the entropy for a thin shell of matter field of a given thickness\nsurrounding the black hole horizon. The thickness is chosen to be large\ncompared with the Planck length and is of the order of the atomic scale. When\nexpressed in terms of a covariant cut-off parameter, the entropy of a thin\nshell of matter field of a given thickness and surrounding the horizon in the\nSchwarzschild black hole background is given by an expression proportional to\nthe area of the black hole horizon. This leading order divergent term in the\ncut-off parameter remains to be logarithmically divergent. The logarithmic\ndivergence is expected from the nature of the solution in the near-horizon\nregion. We will find that these discussions are significant in the context of\nthe continuation to the Euclidean sector and the corresponding regularization\nschemes used to evaluate the thermodynamical properties of matter fields in\ncurved spaces.

The effect\nof temperature on the aerial spraying of tsetse, through its reproductive cycle\nand general population dynamics, is of particular interest, given that cooler\nweather is preferred for the settling of insecticidal droplets. Spray efficacy\nis found to come at a price due to the greater number of cycles necessitated by\ncooler weather. The extra cost is argued to be worth while. Pupae, still in the\nground at the end of spraying, are identified as the main threat to a\nsuccessful operation.

While the\nbest-known algorithm for general bipartite graphs (due to Hopcroft and Karp)\ntakes $O(m \\sqrt{n})$ time, in regular bipartite graphs, a perfect matching is\nknown to be computable in $O(m)$ time. Very recently, the $O(m)$ bound was\nimproved to $O(\\min\\{m, \\frac{n^{2.5}\\ln n}{d}\\})$ expected time, an expression\nthat is bounded by $\\tilde{O}(n^{1.75})$. In this paper, we further improve\nthis result by giving an $O(\\min\\{m, \\frac{n^2\\ln^3 n}{d}\\})$ expected time\nalgorithm for finding a perfect matching in regular bipartite graphs; as a\nfunction of $n$ alone, the algorithm takes expected time $O((n\\ln n)^{1.5})$.\n  To obtain this result, we design and analyze a two-stage sampling scheme that\nreduces the problem of finding a perfect matching in a regular bipartite graph\nto the same problem on a subsampled bipartite graph with $O(n\\ln n)$ edges that\nhas a perfect matching with high probability. The matching is then recovered\nusing the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm.

In contrast to\nthat, the nonuniform magnetic field pattern, induced by the ferromagnet,\nstrongly affect the nucleation of superconductivity leading to an exotic\ndependence of the critical temperature T_{c} on H_{ext}. Deeper in the\nsuperconducting state the effect of the screening currents cannot be neglected\nanymore. In this region of the phase diagram various aspects of the interaction\nbetween vortices and magnetic inhomogeneities are discussed. In the last\nsection we briefly summarize the physics of S/F hybrids when the magnetization\nof the ferromagnet is no longer fixed but can change under the influence of the\nsuperconducting currents. As a consequence, the superconductor and ferromagnet\nbecome truly coupled and the equilibrium configuration of this \"soft\" S/F\nhybrids requires rearrangements of both, superconducting and ferromagnetic\ncharacteristics, as compared with \"hard\" S/F structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Feb 2009 11:21:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-11"}

The\nlate-type alignment can be easily understood in terms of the standard picture\nin which the radio emission is intimately related to areas of recent\nstar-formation. In early-type galaxies the radio emission is expected to be\ndriven by accretion on to a nuclear black hole.

Our results imply that the galaxies are oblate\nspheroids with their radio emission aligned with the minor axis. Remarkably the\nstrength of the correlation of the radio major axis with the optical minor axis\ndepends on radio loudness.

It relies on the assumption that\nsolid spheres are composed of iron and silicates, around which a variable\namount of water is added. The M-R law has been set up assuming that the\nplanetary composition is similar to the averaged composition for silicates and\niron obtained from the major elements ratio of 94 stars hosting exoplanets.\nExcept on Earth for which a tremendous amount of data is available, the\ncomposition of silicate mantles and metallic cores cannot be constrained.\nSimilarly, thermal profiles are poorly known. In this work, the effect of\ncompositional parameters and thermal profiles on radii estimates is quantified.\nIt will be demonstrated that uncertainties related to composition and\ntemperature are of second order compared to the effect of the water amount. The\nSuper-Earths family includes four classes of planets: iron-rich, silicate-rich,\nwater-rich, or with a thick atmosphere. For a given mass, the planetary radius\nincreases significantly from the ironrich to the atmospheric-rich planet. Even\nif some overlaps are likely, M-R measurements could be accurate enough to\nascertain the discovery of an earth-like planet .The present work describes how\nthe amount of water can be assessed from M-R measurements. Such an estimate\ndepends on several assumptions including i) the accuracy of the internal\nstructure model and ii) the accuracy of mass and radius measurements. It is\nshown that if the mass and the radius are perfectly known, the standard\ndeviation on the amount of water is about 4.5 %.

For that very reason the reliable analysis of the first few\nlayers can be necessary. However, in depth profiling methods based on\nsputtering techniques the first layer is always found at the bottom of the\nsputtered crater. Since the depth resolution decreases during sputtering, the\nanalysis of the first few layers are difficult. In order to circumvent this\nproblem, we used reverse Secondary Neutral Mass Spectrometry (SNMS) depth\nprofiling method for electrodeposited multilayered films. We prepared thin film\nsamples in two ways. First, Co/Cu multilayer stacks were electrodeposited on\nSi/Cr/Cu substrates and SNMS depth profiling was carried out from the direction\nof the topmost layer. Secondly, elecrodeposited Co/Cu multilayer stacks were\ncoated with a few microns thick Ni layer and detached from the Si substrate in\norder to study the film structure from the side of the substrate. Using this\nlatter method, we were able to analyze the first and, probably, the most even\nlayers of the thin film structure with high resolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Feb 2009 15:19:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-11"}

It is shown by Elastic Recoil Detection Analysis (ERDA)\nthat the hydrogen concentration increased by increasing H2 flow-rate. Annealing\nof the samples was carried out at 400 and 450 oC for several hours. It has been\nobserved that samples prepared with 6 ml/min flow-rate at both annealing\ntemperatures underwent significant structural changes: the surface of the\nsamples was visibly roughened, gas bubbles were formed and craters were\ncreated. The decay of the periodic structure of Si and Ge layers in these types\nof multilayers was faster than in non-hydrogenated samples. Samples prepared\nwith 1.5 ml/min flow-rate have similar behaviour at 450 oC, but at 400 oC the\ndecay of the first order SAXRD peaks was slower than in case of the\nnon-hydrogenated multilayers. Qualitatively the observed behaviour can be\nexplained by the fast desorption of the saturated hydrogen, leading to the\nformation of bubbles and craters at 450 oC, as well as, at 400oC in the sample\nwith lower H-content, by the possible passivation of the dangling bonds\nresulting in a slowing down of the diffusion intermixing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Feb 2009 15:34:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-11"}

Since the Cygnus region is known to\ncontain OB associations, it is likely that pulsars are formed here. Simulations\nhave shown that this survey could detect 70 pulsars, which would increase our\nunderstanding of the radio pulsar population in this region. We also aim to\nexpand the known population of intermittent and rotating radio transient\n(RRAT)-like pulsars. In this paper we describe our methods of observation,\nprocessing and data analysis, and we present the first results. Our observing\nmethod exploits the way a regularly spaced, linear array of telescopes yields a\ncorresponding regularly spaced series of so-called ``grating'' beams on the\nsky. By simultaneously forming a modest number (eight) of offset digital beams,\nwe can utilize the entire field of view of each WSRT dish, but retain the\ncoherently summed sensitivity of the entire array. For the processing we\nperformed a large number of trial combinations of period and dispersion measure\n(DM) using a computer cluster. In the first processing cycle of the WSRT 8gr8\nCygnus Survey, we have discovered three radio pulsars, with spin periods of\n1.657, 1.099 and 0.445 seconds. These pulsars have been observed on a regular\nbasis since their discovery, both in a special follow-up programme as well as\nin the regular timing programme. The timing solutions are presented in this\npaper. We also discuss this survey method in the context of the SKA and its\npathfinders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Feb 2009 15:36:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
