We find that the phenomenological constraints\non the three-site Higgsless model arising from measurements of Z to b bbar are\nrelatively mild, requiring only that the heavy Dirac fermion be heavier than 1\nTeV or so, and are satisfied automatically in the range of parameters allowed\nby other precision electroweak data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Feb 2009 20:58:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Feb 2009 21:45:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2009 15:01:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-16"}

The data reveal that the field-induced three-fold polarization\nenhancement for H || a (H approx. 20 kOe) observed in DyMnO3 below 6.5 K is due\nto a re-emergence of the Mn-induced Dy spin order with propagation vector k(Dy)\n= k(Mn) = 0.385 b*, which accompanies the suppression of the independent Dy\nmagnetic ordering, k(Dy) = 1/2 b*. For GdMnO3, the Mn-induced ordering of Gd\nspins is used to track the Mn-ordering propagation vector. The data confirm the\nincommensurate ordering reported previously, with k(Mn) varying from 0.245 to\n0.16 b* on cooling from T_N(Mn) down to a transition temperature T'. New\nsuperstructure reflections which appear below T' suggest a propagation vector\nk(Mn) = 1/4 b* in zero magnetic field, which may coexist with the previously\nreported A-type ordering of Mn.

Although carrying a relatively small\nfraction of the total observed flux, the scattered radiation tends to be highly\npolarized and in a direction perpendicular to the direct radiation.

However, the magnetism that dominates the observed inhomogeneous\nline broadening below x ~ 0.19 is overwhelmed by the emergence of a completely\ndifferent kind of magnetism in the heavily overdoped regime. The origin of the\nmagnetism above x ~ 0.19 is currently unknown, but its presence hints at a\ncompetition between superconductivity and magnetism that is reminiscent of the\nunderdoped regime. In contrast, the width of the internal field distribution of\nunderdoped YBa_2Cu_3O_y above Tc is observed to track Tc and the density of\nsuperconducting carriers. This observation suggests that the magnetic response\nabove Tc is not dominated by electronic moments, but rather inhomogeneous\nfluctuating superconductivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Feb 2009 21:08:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2010 21:11:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Herein we describe the potential employment of large detectors\n(>1 kiloton) for studies of higher energy neutrinos interactions, from the\ncosmic rays and as a long baseline neutrino detector. Generally when people\nhave considered large new instruments such as Hanohano and LENA, they have\nabandoned the possibility of doing useful measurements with higher energy\nneutrino interactions since these produce enough light to illuminate every\nphotomultiplier tube, and the scintillation light is isotropic. Here we take\ninto account Fermat's principle, which tells us that indeed the first light to\nreach the PMTs will be on or near the lightcone, the \"Fermat surface\", and that\ndirectional track information is available. Moreover we have realized that\nparticle type distinction is possible (quasi-elastic muons from electrons). In\nfact the resolution from a detector of comparable size to SuperKamiokande, may\nbe better in both angle, energy and possibly particle type. This realization\nopens the doors to a number of applications. Moreover, this capability can be\ndemonstrated with the use of (future) KamLAND detected events in the new long\nbaseline neutrino beam from the Jaeri accelerator in Japan, due to start\noperations this year. Some of the most attractive possibilities for the future\nmay be in using Hanohano as a movable long baseline detector in this same beam,\nthe employment of LENA in Europe in future long baseline neutrino beams from\nCERN, and in the DUSEL underground laboratory at Homestake.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Feb 2009 21:11:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-25"}

For the\nindex 1 saddle case the stable and unstable manifolds of the NHIM are\nco-dimension one in the energy surface, and act as conduits for reacting\ntrajectories in phase space. The situation for index 2 saddles is quite\ndifferent.

Rather, there are different types of\ninvariant manifolds, containing the NHIM and its stable and unstable manifolds,\nthat act as co-dimension one barriers in the energy surface. These barriers\ndivide the energy surface in the vicinity of the index 2 saddle into regions of\nqualitatively different trajectories exhibiting a wider variety of dynamical\nbehavior than for the case of index 1 saddles. In particular, we can identify a\nclass of trajectories, which we refer to as \"roaming trajectories\", which are\nnot associated with reaction along the classical minimum energy path (MEP).

While much work has focused on dense measurement matrices, sparse\nmeasurement schemes are crucial in applications, such as DNA microarrays and\nsensor networks, where dense measurements are not practically feasible. One\npossible construction uses the adjacency matrices of expander graphs, which\noften leads to recovery algorithms much more efficient than $\\ell_1$\nminimization. However, to date, constructions based on expanders have required\nvery high expansion coefficients which can potentially make the construction of\nsuch graphs difficult and the size of the recoverable sets small.\n  In this paper, we construct sparse measurement matrices for the recovery of\nnon-negative vectors, using perturbations of the adjacency matrix of an\nexpander graph with much smaller expansion coefficient. We present a necessary\nand sufficient condition for $\\ell_1$ optimization to successfully recover the\nunknown vector and obtain expressions for the recovery threshold. For certain\nclasses of measurement matrices, this necessary and sufficient condition is\nfurther equivalent to the existence of a \"unique\" vector in the constraint set,\nwhich opens the door to alternative algorithms to $\\ell_1$ minimization. We\nfurther show that the minimal expansion we use is necessary for any graph for\nwhich sparse recovery is possible and that therefore our construction is tight.\nWe finally present a novel recovery algorithm that exploits expansion and is\nmuch faster than $\\ell_1$ optimization.

The\nworld's first determination of a non-zero M3 form factor for the Delta baryon\nis presented. With these results we provide a conclusive analysis which shows\nthat decuplet baryons are deformed. We compare the decuplet baryon results from\na similar lattice calculation of the octet baryons. We establish that the\nenvironment sensitivity is far less pronounced in the case of the decuplet\nbaryons compared to that in the octet baryons. A surprising result is that the\ncharge radii of the decuplet baryons are generally smaller than that of the\noctet baryons. The magnetic moment of the Delta^+ reveals a turn over in the\nlow quark mass region, making it smaller than the proton magnetic moment. These\nresults are consistent with the expectations of quenched chiral perturbation\ntheory. A similar turn over is also noticed in the magnetic moment of the\nSigma^*0, but not for Xi^* where only kaon loops can appear in quenched QCD.\nThe electric quadrupole moment of the Omega^- baryon is positive when the\nnegative charge factor is included, and is equal to 0.86 +- 0.12 x 10^-2 fm^2,\nindicating an oblate shape.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Feb 2009 01:15:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-23"}

The\n\"gauge-dependence\" (arbitrariness) in the localization of linear momentum in\nBBHs is discussed, along with the hope that the qualitative behavior of linear\nmomentum will be gauge-independent. Harmonic coordinates are suggested as a\npossibly preferred foundation for fixing the gauge associated with linear\nmomentum. For a BBH or other compact binary, the Landau-Lifshitz formalism is\nused to define the momenta of the binary's individual bodies in terms of\nintegrals over the bodies' surfaces or interiors, and define the momentum of\nthe gravitational field (spacetime curvature) outside the bodies as a volume\nintegral over the field's momentum density. These definitions will be used in\nsubsequent papers that explore the internal nonlinear dynamics of BBHs via\nnumerical relativity. This formalism is then used, in the 1.5PN approximation,\nto explore momentum flow between a binary's bodies and its gravitational field\nduring the binary's orbital inspiral. Special attention is paid to momentum\nflow and conservation associated with synchronous spin-induced bobbing of the\nblack holes, in the so-called \"extreme-kick configuration\" (where two identical\nblack holes have their spins lying in their orbital plane and antialigned).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Feb 2009 07:16:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-30"}

To conserve hydrodynamics,\ncollisions between the fibers are treated such that momentum and energy are\nconserved locally. The choice of simulation parameters is rationalised on the\nbasis of dimensionless numbers expressing the relative strength of different\nphysical processes. The method is applied to suspensions of semiflexible fibers\nwith a contour length equal to the persistence length, and a mesh size to\ncontour length ratio ranging from 0.055 to 0.32. For such fibers the effects of\nhydrodynamic interactions are observable, but relatively small. The\nnon-crossing constraint, on the other hand, is very important and leads to\nhindered displacements of the fibers, with an effective tube diameter in\nagreement with recent theoretical predictions. The simulation technique opens\nthe way to study the effect of viscous effects and hydrodynamic interactions in\nmicrorheology experiments where the response of an actively driven probe bead\nin a fiber suspension is measured.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Feb 2009 10:39:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-29"}

Prominences often\ndisplay periodic disturbances mostly observed in the Doppler displacement of\nspectral lines and with an amplitude typically of the order of or smaller than\n2--3 km s$^{-1}$, a value which seems to be much smaller than the\ncharacteristic speeds of the prominence plasma (namely the Alfv\\'en and sound\nvelocities). Two particular features of these small amplitude prominence\noscillations is that they seem to damp in a few periods and that they seem not\nto affect the whole prominence structure. In addition, in high spatial\nresolution observations, in which threads can be discerned, small amplitude\noscillations appear to be clearly associated to these fine structure\nconstituents.

Approximately 2000 compact clumps are\nidentified, with a spatially-invariant power law mass distribution index of\n-1.8. Most of the inner clumps show velocity gradients of 1-3 km/s/pc, directed\naway from the exciting nebula. The gradients decrease with distance from the\ncentral O stars, and are consistent with a photoionised gas acceleration model,\nassuming clump lifetimes of a few 10^5 yrs. However, in one clear case, the\nobserved near-constant velocity gradient is difficult to explain with simple\nmodels. Most blue-shifted but very few of the red-shifted clumps are associated\nwith dark absorbing optical globules, confirming that the dominant molecular\ngas motion is expansion away from the central nebula and O stars. Many clumps\nalso lie in a molecular ring, having an expansion velocity of 30 km/s, radius\n11pc, and dynamical lifetime of ~1Myr. The J=3-2/1-0 12CO line ratios of the\nclumps decrease with distance from the O stars, implying a gradient in their\nsurface temperatures; the results are consistent with a simple model of clump\nsurface heating due to the central stars.\n  Seven high-velocity molecular flows are found in the region, with a close\ncorrespondence between these flows and embedded young clusters.

The CO clumps without evidence of embedded stars tend to have lower\nvelocity gradients, and it is suggested that the presence of the young star may\nextend the lifespan of the photoevaporating envelope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Feb 2009 12:45:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

This result suggests that\nthe Carina Nebula experienced at least two major episodes of massive star\nformation. The neutron star may be responsible for remnants of high energy\nactivity seen in multiple wavelengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Feb 2009 14:44:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In this paper we present a novel optical scheme that overcomes this\nlimitation, extending the detection range to angles larger than 90 degrees\n(back-scattering). Our optical scheme is based on a microscope, a wide\nnumerical aperture objective, and a laser illumination, with the collimated\nbeam positioned at a large angle with respect to the optical axis of the\nobjective (Tilted Laser Microscopy, TLM). We present here an extension of the\ntheory for near field scattering, which usually applies only to paraxial\nscattering, to our strongly out-of-axis s ituation. We tested our instrument\nand our calculations with calibrated spherical nanoparticles of several\ndifferent diameters, performing static and dynamic scattering measurements up\nto 110 degrees. The measured static spectra and decay times are compatible with\nthe Mie theory and the diffusion coefficients provided by the Stokes-Einstein\nequation.

First the renormalization group (RG) equation for weak\ninteraction is derived in the current operator language both using the operator\nproduct expansion and the equation of motion method. To access the strong\ncoupling regime, two methods of deducing the RG equation from perturbation\ntheory, based on the scaling hypothesis and on the Callan-Symanzik formulation,\nare discussed. The important role of scale independent terms is emphasized. The\nlatter depend on the regulaization scheme used (length versus temperature\ncutoff). Analyzing the perturbation theory in the fermionic representation, the\ndiagrams contributing to the renormalization group beta-function are\nidentified. A universal part of the beta-function is given by a ladder series\nand summed to all orders in g_2. First non-universal corrections beyond the\nladder series are discussed and are shown to differ from the exact solutions\nobtained within conformal field theory which use a different regularization\nscheme.
