Starburst galaxies drive galactic-scale outflows\nor \"superwinds\" that may be responsible for removing metals from galaxies and\npolluting the Intergalactic Medium (IGM). In the last decade tremendous\nprogress was made in mapping cool entrained gas in superwinds through\nUV/optical imaging and absorption line spectroscopy. These studies demonstrated\nthat superwinds are ubiquitous in galaxies forming stars at high surface\ndensities and that the most powerful starbursts can drive outflows near escape\nvelocity. Theoretical models of galaxy evolution have begun to incorporate\nsuperwinds, using various ad-hoc prescriptions based on our knowledge of the\ncool gas. However, these efforts are fundamentally impeded by our lack of\ninformation about the hot phase of these outflows. The hot X-ray emitting phase\nof a superwind contains the majority of its energy and newly-synthesized\nmetals, and given its high specific energy and inefficient cooling it is also\nthe component most likely escape from the galaxy's gravitational potential\nwell. Knowledge of the chemical composition and velocity of the hot gas are\ncrucial to assess the energy and chemical feedback from a starburst. A high\npriority for the next decade is to enable direct measurements to be made of the\nrates at which starburst galaxies of all masses eject gas, metals, and energy\ninto the IGM. This will require a high sensitivity X-ray imaging spectrometer\ncapable of measuring velocities in faint diffuse X-ray emission with a velocity\naccuracy of ~ 100 km/s.

Comparing our results with previous UV measurements of\nSiC, we distinguish between chemical and structural effects at high frequency.\nWe find that for all spectral regions, 3C ($\\beta$-SiC) and the $\\vec{E}\\bot\n\\vec{c}$ polarization of 6H (a type of $\\alpha$-SiC) have almost identical\noptical functions that can be substituted for each other in modeling\nastronomical environments. Optical functions for $\\vec{E} \\| \\vec{c}$ of 6H SiC\nhave peaks shifted to lower frequency, permitting identification of this\nstructure below $\\lambda \\sim4\\mu$m. The onset of strong UV absorption for pure\nSiC occurs near 0.2 $\\mu$m, but the presence of impurities redshifts the rise\nto 0.33 $\\mu$m. Optical functions are similarly impacted. Such large\ndifferences in spectral characteristics due to structural and chemical effects\nshould be observable and provide a means to distinguish chemical variation of\nSiC dust in space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Feb 2009 20:19:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

Nevertheless, the efficiency most of them is still based on the\nfundamental physical phenomena, such as resonances. Thus, the understanding of\nthe resonance phenomena will be beneficial. One of the well-known examples is\nthe resonant enhancement of the transmission known as Breit-Wigner resonances,\nwhich can be described by a Lorentzian function. But, in many physical systems\nthe scattering of waves involves propagation along different paths, and, as a\nconsequence, results in interference phenomena, where constructive interference\ncorresponds to resonant enhancement and destructive interference to resonant\nsuppression of the transmission. Recently, a variety of experimental and\ntheoretical work has revealed such patterns in different branches of physics.\nThe purpose of this Review is to demonstrate that this kind of resonant\nscattering is related to the Fano resonances, known from atomic physics. One of\nthe main features of the Fano resonances is the asymmetric profile. The\nasymmetry comes from the close coexistence of resonant transmission and\nresonant reflection. Fano successfully explained such a phenomenon in his\nseminal paper in 1961 in terms of interaction of a discrete (localized) state\nwith a continuum of propagation modes. It allows to describe both resonant\nenhancement and resonant suppression in a unified manner. All of these\nproperties can be demonstrated in the frame of a very simple model, which will\nbe used throughout the Review to show that resonant reflections observed in\ndifferent complex systems are indeed closely related to the Fano resonances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Feb 2009 22:17:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 May 2009 19:35:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 28 May 2009 10:44:33 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 27 Jun 2009 19:47:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-13"}

Here we present the ensemble CCE theory, which is based on similar ideas\nof the single-sample CCE: The bath evolution is factorized into the product of\nall possible cluster correlations, each of which accounts for the authentic\n(non-factorizable) collective excitation of a group of bath spins, and for the\nfinite-time evolution in the qubit decoherence problem, convergent results can\nbe obtained by truncating the ensemble CCE by keeping cluster correlations up\nto a certain size. A difference between the ensemble CCE and single-sample CCE\nis that the mean-field treatment in the latter formalism of the diagonal part\nof the spin-spin interaction in the bath is not possible in the former case.\nThe ensemble CCE can be applied to non-factorizable initial states. The\nensemble CCE is checked against the exact solution of an XY spin bath model.\nFor small spin baths, it is shown that single-sample dynamics is sensitive to\nthe sampling of the initial state from a thermal ensemble and hence very\ndifferent from the ensemble average.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Feb 2009 05:58:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-27"}

The common measure to evaluate the\nquality of an ancestry labeling scheme is by its {\\em label size}, that is the\nmaximal number of bits stored in a label, taken over all $n$-node trees. The\ndesign of ancestry labeling schemes finds applications in XML search engines.\nIn the context of these applications, even small improvements in the label size\nare important. In fact, the literature about this topic is interested in the\nexact label size rather than just its order of magnitude. As a result,\nfollowing the proposal of an original scheme of size $2\\log n$ bits, a\nconsiderable amount of work was devoted to improve the bound on the label size.\nThe current state of the art upper bound is $\\log n + O(\\sqrt{\\log n})$ bits\nwhich is still far from the known $\\log n + \\Omega(\\log\\log n)$ lower bound.\nMoreover, the hidden constant factor in the additive $O(\\sqrt{\\log n})$ term is\nlarge, which makes this term dominate the label size for typical current XML\ntrees.\n  In attempt to provide good performances for real XML data, we rely on the\nobservation that the depth of a typical XML tree is bounded from above by a\nsmall constant. Having this in mind, we present an ancestry labeling scheme of\nsize $\\log n+2\\log d +O(1)$, for the family of trees with at most $n$ nodes and\ndepth at most $d$. In addition to our main result, we prove a result that may\nbe of independent interest concerning the existence of a linear {\\em universal\ngraph} for the family of forests with trees of bounded depth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Feb 2009 09:49:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-19"}

The aim is to improve the\naccuracy of the computed temperature structure and to decrease the computation\ntime. The accuracy, efficiency and applicability of the methods in various\ncorners of parameter space are investigated. The effects of using these methods\non the vertical structure of the circumstellar disk as obtained from\nhydrostatic equilibrium computations are also addressed. Two methods are\npresented. First, an energy diffusion approximation is used to improve the\naccuracy of the temperature structure in highly obscured regions of the disk,\nwhere photon counts are low. Second, a modified random walk approximation is\nemployed to decrease the computation time. This modified random walk ensures\nthat the photons that end up in the high-density regions can quickly escape to\nthe lower density regions, while the energy deposited by these photons in the\ndisk is still computed accurately. A new radiative transfer code, MCMax, is\npresented in which both these diffusion approximations are implemented. These\ncan be used simultaneously to increase both computational speed and decrease\nstatistical noise. We conclude that the diffusion approximations allow for fast\nand accurate computations of the temperature structure, vertical disk structure\nand observables of very optically thick circumstellar disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Feb 2009 10:35:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We model the core collapse dynamics of massive progenitor\nstars with high surface magnetic fields in the theoretical framework of a\nself-similar general polytropic magnetofluid under the self-gravity with a\nquasi-spherical symmetry. With the specification of physical parameters such as\nmass density, temperature, magnetic field and wind mass loss rate on the\nprogenitor stellar surface and the consideration of a rebound shock breaking\nthrough the stellar interior and envelope, we find a remnant compact object\n(i.e. neutron star) left behind at the centre with a radius of $\\sim 10^6$ cm\nand a mass range of $\\sim 1-3$ solar masses. Moreover, we find that surface\nmagnetic fields of such kind of compact objects can be $\\sim 10^{14}-10^{15}$\nG, consistent with those inferred for magnetars which include soft gamma-ray\nrepeaters (SGRs) and anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs). The magnetic field\nenhancement factor critically depends on the self-similar scaling index $n$,\nwhich also determines the initial density distribution of the massive\nprogenitor. We propose that magnetized massive stars as magnetar progenitors\nbased on the magnetohydrodynamic evolution of the gravitational core collapse\nand rebound shock. Our physical mechanism, which does not necessarily require\nad hoc dynamo amplification within a fast spinning neutron star, favours the\n`fossil field' scenario of forming magnetars from the strongly magnetized core\ncollapse inside massive progenitor stars. With a range of surface magnetic\nfield strengths over massive progenitor stars, our scenario allows a continuum\nof magnetic field strengths from pulsars to magnetars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Feb 2009 12:07:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The graviton reggeization will change this increase\nto the normal logarithmic behaviour $\\sigma \\propto \\ln^2 s$. However, we\ndemonstrated that this happens at ultra high energy, much higher than the LHC\nenergy. In the region of accessible energy we need to assume that there is a\ndifferent source for the total cross section, with the value of the cross\nsection about 40 mb. With this assumption we successfully describe\n$\\sigma_{tot}, \\sigma_{el}$ and $\\sigma_{diff}$ for the accessible range of\nenergy from the fixed target Fermilab to the Tevatron energies.

The second surprise is the fact that the total\ncross section and the diffraction cross section can increase considerably from\nthe Tevatron to the LHC energy. The bad description of $B_{el}$ gives the\nstrong argument that the non N=4 SYM background should depend on energy. We\nbelieve that we have a dilemma: to find a new mechanism for the inelastic\nproduction in the framework of N=4 SYM other than the reggeized graviton\ninteraction, or to accept that N=4 SYM is irrelevant to any experimental data\nthat has been measured before the LHC era.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Feb 2009 15:24:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2009 12:39:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-19"}

We study the existing forms of the mass\nfunctions in the literature and compare their predictions for semi-analytical\ngalaxy formation models. Two methods are used in the literature to compute the\nnet formation rate of halos, one by simply taking the derivative of the halo\nmass function and the other using the prescription due to Sasaki (1994). For\nthe Press-Schechter (PS) mass function, we compare various model predictions,\nusing these two methods. However, as the Sasaki formalism cannot be easily\ngeneralized for other mass functions, we use the derivative while comparing\nmodel predictions of different mass functions. We show that the reionization\nhistory and UV luminosity function of Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) predicted by\nthe PS mass function differs from those using any other existing mass function,\nlike Sheth-Tormen (ST) mass function.In particular the reionization efficiency\nof molecular cooled halos has to be substantially reduced when one uses the ST\nand other mass functions obtained from the simulation instead of the PS mass\nfunction. Using $\\chi^2$-minimization, we find that the observed UV luminosity\nfunctions of LBGs at $3.0\\le z\\le 7.4$ are better reproduced by models using\nthe ST mass function compared to models that use the PS mass function. On the\nother hand, the volume filling factor of the metals expelled from the galaxies\nthrough supernovae driven outflows differs very little between models with\ndifferent mass functions. It depends on the way we treat merging outflows. We\nalso show that the porosity weighted average quantities related to the outflow\nare not very sensitive to the differences in the halo mass function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Feb 2009 13:57:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Barkhausen noise (BN) is generated by the\ndiscontinuous motion of magnetic domains as they interact with impurities and\ndefects. BN is one of the many examples of crackling noise, arising in a\nvariety of contexts with remarkably similar features, and occurring when a\nsystem responds in a jerky manner to a smooth external forcing. Among all\ncrackling system, we focus on BN, where a complete and consistent picture\nemerges thanks to an exactly solvable model of avalanche dynamics, known as the\nABBM model, which ultimately describes the system in terms of a Langevin\nequation for the velocity of the avalanche front. Despite its simplicity, the\nABBM model is able to accurately reproduce the phenomenology observed in the\nexperiments on a large class of magnetic materials, as long as universal\nproperties are involved. To complete the picture and to understand the\nlong-standing discrepancy between the ABBM theory and the experiments, which\notherwise agree exceptionally well, consisting of the puzzling asymmetric shape\nof the noise pulses, microscopic details must be taken into account, namely the\neffects of eddy current retardation. These effects can be incorporated in the\nmodel, and result, to a first-order approximation, in a negative effective mass\nassociated with the wall. The progress made in understanding BN is potentially\nrelevant for other crackling systems: on the one hand, the ABBM model turns out\nto be a paradigmatic model for the universal behaviour of avalanche dynamics;\non the other hand, the microscopic explanation of the asymmetry in the noise\npulses suggests that inertial effects may also be at the origin of pulses\nasymmetry observed in other crackling systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Feb 2009 15:50:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-19"}
