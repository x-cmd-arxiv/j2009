In contrast to previous studies in the Orion\nNebula Cluster and NGC 2264, we do not see a clear signature of disk braking in\nTau-Aur and Cha I. We find that both accretors and non-accretors have similar\ndistributions of v sin i. The rotational velocities in both regions show a\nclear mass dependence, with F--K stars rotating on average about twice as fast\nas M stars, consistent with results reported for other clusters of similar age.\nSimilarly, we find the upper envelope of the observed values of specific\nangular momentum j varies as M^0.5 for our sample which spans a mass range of\n~0.16 to ~3 M_sun. This power law complements previous studies in Orion which\nestimated j is proportional to M^0.25 for < ~2 Myr stars in the same mass\nregime, and a sharp decline in j with decreasing mass for older stars (~10 Myr)\nwith M < 2 M_sun. For a subsample of 67 objects with mid-IR photometry, we\nexamine the connection between accretion signatures and dusty disks: in the\nvast majority of cases (63/67), the two properties correlate well, which\nsuggests that the timescale of gas accretion is similar to the lifetime of\ninner disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Feb 2009 10:26:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

The Higgs boson is insensitive to high energies because of\nsupersymmetry and also because it is a pseudo-Goldstone boson of a global\nsymmetry (referred to as double protection or super-little Higgs mechanism). A\nlarge shift in the Higgs quartic self coupling is obtained via a non-decoupling\nD-term coming from an extra gauge group, resulting in a Higgs that can be as\nheavy as 135 GeV with a tuning milder than 10%. With an appropriate choice of\nquantum numbers one can achieve that the additional quartic is generated\nwithout a corresponding shift in the Higgs mass, thus preserving the double\nprotection of the Higgs. The model predicts the existence of several\ntop-partner fermions one of which can be as light as 700 GeV, while the\nordinary MSSM states could be as light as 400 GeV. In addition to many new\nparticles in the multi-TeV range there would also be an axion-like state very\nweakly coupled to standard model (SM) matter which could be in the sub-GeV\nregime, and sterile neutrinos which could be light.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Feb 2009 14:59:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Feb 2009 23:09:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 6 May 2009 20:40:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-15"}

A main reason for this has been the existence of\nlinear space lower bounds for even simple problems such as determining the\nconnectedness of a graph. However, in many new scenarios that arise from social\nand other interaction networks, the number of vertices is significantly less\nthan the number of edges. This has led to the formulation of the semi-streaming\nmodel where we assume that the space is (near) linear in the number of vertices\n(but not necessarily the edges), and the edges appear in an arbitrary (and\npossibly adversarial) order.\n  In this paper we focus on graph sparsification, which is one of the major\nbuilding blocks in a variety of graph algorithms. There has been a long history\nof (non-streaming) sampling algorithms that provide sparse graph approximations\nand it a natural question to ask if the sparsification can be achieved using a\nsmall space, and in addition using a single pass over the data? The question is\ninteresting from the standpoint of both theory and practice and we answer the\nquestion in the affirmative, by providing a one pass\n$\\tilde{O}(n/\\epsilon^{2})$ space algorithm that produces a sparsification that\napproximates each cut to a $(1+\\epsilon)$ factor. We also show that $\\Omega(n\n\\log \\frac1\\epsilon)$ space is necessary for a one pass streaming algorithm to\napproximate the min-cut, improving upon the $\\Omega(n)$ lower bound that arises\nfrom lower bounds for testing connectivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Feb 2009 16:50:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 May 2009 20:44:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-05"}

Our SM prediction BR(B -> K* nu anti-nu)=(6.8^+1.0_-1.1) x 10^-6\nturns out to be significantly lower than the ones present in the literature.\nOur improved calculation BR(B -> X(s) nu anti-nu)=(2.7+-0.2) x 10^-5 in the SM\navoids the normalization to the BR(B -> X(c) e anti-nu(e)) and, with less than\n10% total uncertainty, is the most accurate to date. The results for the SM and\nNP scenarios can be transparently summarized in a (epsilon,eta) plane with a\nnon-vanishing eta signalling the presence of new right-handed down-quark\nflavour violating couplings which can be ideally probed by the decays in\nquestion. Measuring the three branching ratios and one additional polarization\nobservable in B -> K* nu anti-nu allows to overconstrain the resulting point in\nthe (epsilon,eta) plane with (epsilon,eta)=(1,0) corresponding to the SM. The\ncorrelations of these three channels with the rare decays K+ -> pi+ nu anti-nu,\nKL -> pi0 nu anti-nu, B -> X(s) l+ l- and B(s) -> mu+ mu- offer powerful tests\nof New Physics with new right-handed couplings and non-MFV interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Feb 2009 18:53:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Feb 2009 14:26:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-08"}

If - so a\ntypical argumentation - QM gives a universally valid basis for the description\nof all natural systems, then the gravitational field should have quantum\nproperties. Together with the arguments against semi-classical theories of\ngravity, this leads to a strategy which takes a quantization of GR as the\nnatural avenue to Quantum Gravity. And a quantization of the gravitational\nfield would in some sense correspond to a quantization of geometry. Spacetime\nwould have quantum properties. But, this strategy will only be successful, if\ngravity is a fundamental interaction. - What, if gravity is instead an\nintrinsically classical phenomenon? Then, if QM is nevertheless fundamentally\nvalid, gravity can not be a fundamental interaction. An intrinsically classical\ngravity in a quantum world would have to be an emergent, induced or residual,\nmacroscopic effect, caused by other interactions. The gravitational field (as\nwell as spacetime) would not have any quantum properties. A quantization of GR\nwould lead to artifacts without any relation to nature. The serious problems of\nall approaches to Quantum Gravity that start from a direct quantization of GR\nor try to capture the quantum properties of gravity in form of a 'graviton'\ndynamics - together with the, meanwhile, rich spectrum of approaches to an\nemergent gravity and/or spacetime - make this latter option more and more\ninteresting for the development of a theory of Quantum Gravity.

We test the hypothesis\nthat the offset is the result of true polar wander (TPW), the motion of the\nsolid surface with respect to the spin axis, caused by a mass redistribution\nwithin or on the surface of Mars. In particular, we consider TPW driven by\nlate-stage volcanism during the late Hesperian to Amazonian. There is\nobservational and qualitative support for this hypothesis: in both North and\nSouth, observed offsets lie close to a great circle 90 degrees from Tharsis, as\nexpected for polar wander after Tharsis formed. We calculate the magnitude and\ndirection of TPW produced by mapped late-stage lavas for a range of\nlithospheric thicknesses, lava thicknesses, eruption histories, and prior polar\nwander events. If Tharsis formed close to the equator, the stabilizing effect\nof a fossil rotational bulge located close to the equator leads to predicted\nTPW of <2 degrees, too small to account for observed offsets. If, however,\nTharsis formed far from the equator, late-stage TPW driven by low-latitude,\nlate-stage volcanism would be 6-33 degrees, similar to that inferred from the\nlocation of paleopolar deposits. 4.4+/-1.3x10^19 kg of young erupted lava can\naccount for the offset of the Dorsa Argentea Formation from the present-day\nsouth rotation pole. This mass is consistent with prior mapping-based estimates\nand would imply a mass release of CO2 by volcanic degassing similar to that in\nthe atmosphere at the present time. The South Polar Layered Deposits are offset\nfrom the spin axis in the opposite sense to the other paleopolar deposits. This\ncan be explained by an additional contribution from a plume beneath Elysium.

In particular, we measured\nconditional fluctuations by means of the scale-length method and determined\ntheir probability distribution. In this way we find that galaxy distribution in\nthese samples is characterized by large amplitude fluctuations with a large\nspatial extension, whose size is only limited by the sample's boundaries. These\nfluctuations are quite typical and persistent in the sample's volumes, and they\nare detected in two independent regions in the northern and southern galactic\ncaps. We discuss the relation of the scale-length method to several statistical\nquantities, such as counts of galaxies as a function of redshift and apparent\nmagnitude. We confirm previous results, which have determined by magnitude and\nredshift counts that there are fluctuations of about 30% between the southern\nand the northern galactic caps and we relate explicitly these counts to\nstructures in redshift space. We show that the estimation of fluctuation\namplitude normalized to the sample density is biased by systematic effects,\nwhich we discuss in detail. We consider the type of fluctuations predicted by\nstandard cosmological models of structure formation in the linear regime and,\nto study nonlinear clustering, we analyze several samples of mock-galaxy\ncatalogs generated from the distribution of dark matter in cosmological N-body\nsimulations. In this way we conclude that the galaxy fluctuations present in\nthese samples are too large in amplitude and too extended in space to be\ncompatible with the predictions of the standard models of structure formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Feb 2009 09:21:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-02"}

The generic infinitesimal\nrigidity of a body-and-hinge framework has been characterized in terms of the\nunderlying multigraph independently by Tay and Whiteley as follows: A\nmultigraph $G$ can be realized as an infinitesimally rigid body-and-hinge\nframework by mapping each vertex to a body and each edge to a hinge if and only\nif ({d+1 \\choose 2}-1)G$ contains ${d+1\\choose 2}$ edge-disjoint spanning\ntrees, where $({d+1 \\choose 2}-1)G$ is the graph obtained from $G$ by replacing\neach edge by $({d+1\\choose 2}-1)$ parallel edges. In 1984 they jointly posed a\nquestion about whether their combinatorial characterization can be further\napplied to a nongeneric case. Specifically, they conjectured that $G$ can be\nrealized as an infinitesimally rigid body-and-hinge framework if and only if\n$G$ can be realized as that with the additional ``hinge-coplanar'' property,\ni.e., all the hinges incident to each body are contained in a common\nhyperplane. This conjecture is called the Molecular Conjecture due to the\nequivalence between the infinitesimal rigidity of ``hinge-coplanar''\nbody-and-hinge frameworks and that of bar-and-joint frameworks derived from\nmolecules in 3-dimension. In 2-dimensional case this conjecture has been proved\nby Jackson and Jord{\\'a}n in 2006.

In particular, it is\nwell established that the late-time dynamics of gravitational collapse is\ndominated by a power-law decaying tail of the form $Mt^{-(2l+3)}$, where $M$ is\nthe black-hole mass. It should be emphasized, however, that in a typical\nevolution scenario there is a considerable time window in which the signal is\nno longer dominated by the black-hole quasinormal modes, but the leading order\npower-law tail has not yet taken over. Higher-order terms may have a\nconsiderable contribution to the signal at these intermediate times. It is\ntherefore of interest to analyze these higher-order corrections to the\nleading-order power-law behavior.

The size of\nthe occurring condensation and evaporation interfaces is determined by the\nso-called Field-length, which gives the dimension at which the instability is\nsignificantly damped by thermal conduction. Our aim is to study the relevance\nof conduction scale effects in the numerical modelling of a bistable medium and\ncheck the applicability of conventional and alternative adaptive mesh\ntechniques. The low physical value of the thermal conduction within the ISM\ndefines a multiscale problem, hence promoting the use of adaptive meshes.

Our results, based upon a new CCF\nmethodology for determining the time-resolved spectral lag, are summarized as\nfollows. First, the evolution in the arrival offset of prompt gamma-ray photon\ncounts between Swift-BAT 15-25 keV and 50-100 keV energy bands (intrinsic\ngamma-ray spectral lag) appears to be anti-correlated with the arrival offset\nbetween prompt 15-350 keV gamma-rays and the optical emission observed by\nTORTORA (extrinsic optical/gamma-ray spectral lag), thus effectively\npartitioning the burst into two main episodes at ~T+28+/-2 sec. Second, the\nrise and decline of prompt optical emission at ~T+10+/-1 sec and ~T+50+/-1 sec,\nrespectively, both coincide with discontinuities in the hard to soft evolution\nof the photon index for a power law fit to 15-150 keV Swift-BAT data at\n~T+8+/-2 sec and ~T+48+/-1 sec. These spectral energy changes also coincide\nwith intervals whose time-resolved spectral lag values are consistent with\nzero, at ~T+12+/-2 sec and ~T+50+/-2 sec. These results, which are robust\nacross heuristic permutations of Swift-BAT energy channels and varying temporal\nbin resolution, have also been corroborated via independent analysis of\nKonus-Wind data. This potential discovery may provide the first observational\nevidence for an implicit connection between spectral lags and GRB emission\nmechanisms in the context of canonical fireball phenomenology.
