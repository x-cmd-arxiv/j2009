One of the reasons for this is the lack of a good model of the central\nengine of GRB. A major problem in the proposed models with a black hole (BH) in\nthe center is that they don't explain the observed evidences of late time\nactivity of the central engine.\n  In this paper we are starting the search for a possible model of that central\nengine as a rotating compact body of still unknown nature. The formation of\njets in the new model lies entirely on the fundamental Teukolsky Master\nEquation.

Two series of simulations are compared; one that follows only the\nevolution of the dark matter component and a second one where a baryonic\ncomponent is added. These simulations include radiative cooling but neglect\nstar formation and feedback, leading most baryons to collect at the halo center\nin a disk which is too small and too massive when compared with typical spiral.\nThis unrealistic model allows us, nevertheless, to gauge the maximum effect\nthat galaxies may have in transforming their dark halos. We find that the shape\nof the halo becomes more axisymmetric: halos are transformed from triaxial into\nessentially oblate systems, with well-aligned isopotential contours of roughly\nconstant flattening (c/a ~ 0.85). Halos always contract as a result of galaxy\nassembly, but the effect is substantially less pronounced than predicted by the\n\"adiabatic contraction\" hypothesis. The reduced contraction helps to reconcile\nLambdaCDM halos with constraints on the dark matter content inside the solar\ncircle and should alleviate the long-standing difficulty of matching\nsimultaneously the scaling properties of galaxy disks and the luminosity\nfunction. The halo contraction is also less pronounced than found in earlier\nsimulations, a disagreement that suggests that halo contraction is not solely a\nfunction of the initial and final distribution of baryons. Not only how much\nbaryonic mass has been deposited at the center of a halo matters, but also the\nmode of its deposition. It might prove impossible to predict the halo response\nwithout a detailed understanding of a galaxy's assembly history.

The\ndifferences between the test particle and efficient acceleration cases are\nsubstantial and occur for both slow and fast temperature equilibration rates:\nin cases of higher acceleration efficiency, particular ion states are more\npopulated at lower electron temperatures.

Here bounce phase and holonomy\ncorrections originate from Loop Quantum Cosmology. We re-derive formulas for\nthe corrections for the model with a scalar field content. Background dynamics\nwith a free scalar field and multi-fluid potential are considered. Since the\nconsiderations are semi-classical effects of quantum fluctuations of the\nbackground dynamics are not taken into account. Quantum and classical\nback-reaction effects are also neglected. To find spectrum of the gravitational\nwaves both analytical approximations as well as numerical investigations were\nperformed. We have found analytical solutions on super-horizontal and\nsub-horizontal regimes and derived corresponding tensor power spectra. Also\noccupation number $n_{\\bf k}$ and parameter $\\Omega_{\\text{gw}}$ were derived\nin sub-horizontal limit, leading to its extremely low present value. Final\nresults are numerical power spectra of the gravitational waves produced in\npresence of quantum holonomy corrections. The obtained spectrum has two UV and\nIR branches where $\\mathcal{P}_T \\propto k^2$, however with the different\nprefactors. Spectrum connecting these regions is in the form of oscillations.\nWe have found good agreement between numerical spectrum and this obtained from\nthe analytical model. Obtained spectrum can be directly applied as initial\nconditions for the inflationary modes. We mention possible resulting\nobservational features of the CMB in particular B-type polarization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Feb 2009 19:14:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2009 21:50:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-09"}

The search includes the possibility of quintessential\nflat universes, i.e., the analysis is restricted to the determination of the\ndimensionless matter density and the quintessential parameters, $\\Omega_{\\rm\nM}$ and $w_{\\rm Q}$, respectively. Our study is focused on comparing the\nposition of features at large scales in the density fluctuation field at\ndifferent redshifts by analysing the evolution of the quasar two-point\ncorrelation function. We trace the density field fluctuations at large scales\nusing a large and homogeneous sample of quasars ($\\sim$ 38000 objects with 0.3\n$\\lesssim$ z $\\le$ 2.4 and a median $z=1.45$) drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey Data Release Six. The analysis relies on the assumption that, in the\nlinear regime, the length scale of a particular feature should remain fixed at\ndifferent times of the universe for the proper cosmological model. Our study\ndoes not assume any particular comoving length scale at which a feature should\nbe found, but intends to perform a comparison for a wide range of scales\ninstead. This is done by quantifying the amount of overlap among the quasar\ncorrelation functions at different times using a cross-correlation technique.\nThe most likely cosmological model is $\\Omega_{\\rm M}=0.21\\pm 0.02$ and $w_{\\rm\nQ}=-0.93\\pm0.04$, in agreement with previous studies. These constraints are the\nresult of a good overall agreement of the correlation function at different\nredshifts over scales $\\sim 100-300\\mpc$. Under the assumption of a flat\ncosmological model, our results indicate that we are living in a low density\nuniverse with a quintessential parameter greater than the one corresponding to\na cosmological constant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Feb 2009 20:03:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

NGC 3718 is a\nstrikingly unusual galaxy with a strong straight dust lane across the center,\npeculiar diffuse spiral arms, and an extended disk of neutral hydrogen. Earlier\nwork showed the gas disk to be strongly twisted, warping through edge-on where\nwe see the straight dust lane; stars formed in this gas appear to make up the\n'spiral arms'. Our improved maps show a twisted but bisymmetric disk of gas\nextending to 7arcmin or 35kpc, where the orbital period is roughly 1Gyr. It is\nsurrounded by fragmentary spiral features, and a streamer of gas extending to a\ncloud lying 12arcmin or 60kpc to the north. We use INSPECTOR, a task in GIPSY,\nto fit a tilted-ring model interactively to slices through the HI data cube.\nThe apparent major axis swings through 100 degrees from the innermost gas\norbits at 30arcsec radius to the outer edge. When viewed in the reference frame\nof the galaxy's stellar disk, the innermost gas orbits are nearly polar, while\nthe outer rings of gas are tilted at 30-40 degrees. The line of nodes, where\nthe gas orbits pass through the plane of the stellar disk, twists by roughly 90\ndegrees about the pole. We do not see gas orbiting in the plane of the stellar\ndisk. If we assume that the galaxy's dark halo shares the same midplane, then\nthe observed twist can be explained by differential precession in a dynamical\nmodel in which the dark halo is fairly round. The run of tilt with radius is\nclose to what is required for the warped gas disk to precess rigidly in the\ngalaxy's gravitational field without changing its shape. This fact probably\naccounts for the longevity of the twisted structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Feb 2009 20:08:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
