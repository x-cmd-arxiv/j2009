We examine the\nimplications of such a \"dark force\" for several terrestrial experiments,\nincluding Eotvos tests of the WEP, direct-detection DM searches, and collider\nstudies. The presence of a dark force implies a non-vanishing effect in Eotvos\ntests that could be probed by current and future experiments depending on the\nDM model. For scalar singlet DM scenarios, a dark force of astrophysically\nrelevant magnitude is ruled out in large regions of parameter space by the DM\nrelic density and WEP constraints. WEP tests also imply constraints on the\nHiggs-exchange contributions to the spin-independent (SI) DM-nucleus direct\ndetection cross-section. For WIMP scenarios, these considerations constrain\nHiggs-exchange contributions to the SI cross-section to be subleading compared\nto gauge-boson mediated contributions. In multicomponent DM scenarios, a dark\nforce would preclude large shifts in the rate for Higgs decay to two photons\nassociated with DM-multiplet loops that might otherwise lead to measurable\ndeviations at the LHC or a future linear collider. The combination of\nobservations from galactic dynamics, large scale structure formation, Eotvos\nexperiments, DM-direct-detection experiments, and colliders can further\nconstrain the size of new long range forces in the dark sector.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Feb 2009 20:24:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2009 03:09:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-05"}

For\nPLANCK and CMBPol we find that the estimator containing the product of the E\nand B components of the polarization field is the most sensitive. The variance\nof this EB estimator, N(L) is roughly independent of the multipole L, and is\nonly weakly dependent on the instrumental beam. For FWHM of the beam size ~\n5'-50', and instrument noise $\\Delta_p ~ 5-50 uK-arcmin, the scaling of\nvariance N(L) can be fitted by a power law N(L)=3.3 x 10^{-7} \\Delta^2_p\n(FWHM)^{1.3} sq-deg.

We\ndiscuss the implications of such constraints, both for the various physical\neffects that can rotate the polarization as photons travel from the last\nscattering surface as well as for constraints on instrumental systematics that\ncan also lead to a spurious rotation signal. Rotation of the CMB polarization\ngenerates B-modes which will act as contamination for the primordial B-modes\ndetection.

The Spitzer-Galactic Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire\nimages of these regions show much more extended emission than that seen by\nTIMMI2, and this is attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) bands.\nFor the MIR sources associated with radio continuum radiation (Paper I) there\nis a close morphological correspondence between the two emissions, suggesting\nthat the ionized gas (radio source) and hot dust (MIR source) coexist inside\nthe H II region. We found five MIR compact sources which are not associated\nwith radio continuum emission, and are thus prime candidates for hosting young\nmassive protostars. In particular, objects IRAS 14593-5852 II (only detected at\n17.7 microns) and 17008-4040 I are likely to be genuine O-type protostellar\nobjects. We also present TIMMI2 N-band spectra of eight sources, all of which\nare dominated by a prominent silicate absorption feature (~ 9.7 microns). From\nthese data we estimate column densities in the range (7-17)x10^22 cm^-2, in\ngood agreement with those derived from the 1.2 mm data (Paper II). Seven\nsources show bright [Ne II] line emission, as expected from ionized gas\nregions. Only IRAS 123830-6128 shows detectable PAH emission at 8.6 and 11.3\nmicrons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Feb 2009 16:10:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2009 19:48:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

Brown and G. Ahlers, Phys.\nFluids, 20, 075101 (2008)) for the large-scale-circulation (LSC) dynamics of\nRayleigh-Benard convection in cylindrical containers. The model consists of a\npair of stochastic ordinary differential equations, motivated by the\nNavier-Stokes equations, one each for the strength delta and the orientation\ntheta_0 of the LSC. Here we extend it to cases where the rotational invariance\nof the system is broken by one of several physically relevant perturbations. As\nan example we present experimental measurements of the LSC dynamics for a\ncontainer tilted relative to gravity. In that case the model predicts that the\nbuoyancy of the thermal boundary layers encourages fluid to travel along the\nsteepest slope, that it locks the LSC in this direction, and that it\nstrengthens the flow, as seen in experiments. The increase in LSC strength is\nshown to be responsible for the observed suppression of cessations and\nazimuthal fluctuations. We predict and observe that for large enough tilt\nangles, the restoring force that aligns the flow with the slope is strong\nenough to cause oscillations of the LSC around this orientation. This planar\noscillation mode is different from coherent torsional oscillations that have\nbeen observed previously. The model was applied also to containers with\nelliptical cross-sections and predicts that the pressure due to the side walls\nforces the flow into a preferred orientation in the direction of the longest\ndiameter. When the ellipticity is large enough, then oscillations around this\norientation are predicted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Feb 2009 18:19:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

It is found that the resultant Measurement Color Quantum\nElectrodynamics (MC-QED) contains a microscopic quantum electrodynamic arrow of\ntime that emerges dynamically, independent of any thermodynamic or cosmological\nassumptions. This occurs because the photon has a negative time parity in\nMC-QED. This causes a spontaneous breaking of the T and CPT symmetry to be\ngenerated by the physical requirement that a stable vacuum state exists in the\nMC-QED formalimm. This dynamically selects operator solutions containing a\ncausal, retarded, quantum electrodynamic arrow of time due in the Heisenberg\noperator equations of motion. In support of the validity of this idea we show\nthat a classic nonlinear optics experiment in the scientific literature, which\ninvolves a Michelson interferometer using combinations of ordinary mirrors and\nphase conjugate mirrors, contains experimental results which support the idea\nthat the photon has a negative parity under Wigner time reversal and thus\ncarries the arrow of time in the universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Feb 2009 18:54:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2009 15:53:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 18 Jul 2009 20:48:31 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 14 Aug 2009 15:59:05 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 29 Aug 2009 18:43:35 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2009 14:44:24 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Sun, 12 Sep 2010 15:45:54 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2011 03:47:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-19"}

We observed a sample of 23 Centaurs and found nine to be active,\nwith mass-loss rates measured from several kg/s to several tonnes/s. Considered\nas a group, we find that the \"active Centaurs\" in our sample have perihelia\nsmaller than the inactive Centaurs (median 5.9 AU vs. 8.7 AU), and smaller than\nthe median perihelion distance computed for all known Centaurs (12.4 AU). This\nsuggests that their activity is thermally driven. There are several\npossibilities for the origin of the mass-loss from the active Centaurs. We\nconsider the possibility that activity in the Centaurs is triggered by the\nconversion of amorphous ice into the crystalline form accompanied by the\nrelease of trapped gases, including carbon monoxide. By imposing the condition\nthat crystallization should occur when the crystallization time is shorter than\nthe orbital period we find a qualitative match to the perihelion distribution\nof the active Centaurs and conclude that the data are consistent with the\nhypothesis that the Centaurs contain amorphous ice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Feb 2009 20:12:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The colours of\nthese halos are too red to be reconciled with any hitherto known type of\nstellar population, and instead indicative of a very bottom-heavy stellar\ninitial mass function (IMF). Due to the large mass-to-light ratios of such\nstellar halos, they could contribute substantially to the baryonic masses of\ngalaxies while adding very little to their overall luminosities. The red halos\nof galaxies therefore constitute potential reservoirs for some of the baryons\nstill missing from inventories in the low-redshift Universe. While most studies\nof red halos have focused on disk galaxies, a red excess has also been reported\nin the faint outskirts of blue compact galaxies (BCGs). A bottom-heavy IMF can\nexplain the colours of these structures as well, but due to model degeneracies,\nstellar populations with standard IMFs and abnormally high metallicities have\nalso been demonstrated to fit the data. Here, we show that due to recent\ndevelopments in the field of spectral synthesis, the metallicities required in\nthis alternative scenario may be less extreme than previously thought. This\nsuggests that the red excess seen in the outskirts of BCGs may stem from a\nnormal, intermediate-metallicity host galaxy rather than a red halo of the type\nseen around disk galaxies. The inferred host metallicity does, however, still\nrequire the host to be more metal-rich than the gas in the central starburst of\nBCGs, in contradiction with current simulations of how BCGs form.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Feb 2009 21:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-02"}

The galaxies are selected from the\nlarger sample of the SINS survey, based on the prominence of ordered rotational\nmotions with respect to more complex merger induced dynamics. The quality of\nthe data allows us to carefully select systems with kinematics dominated by\nrotation, and to model the gas dynamics across the whole galaxy using suitable\nexponential disk models. We obtain a good correlation between the dynamical\nmass and the stellar mass, finding that large gas fractions Mgas~M*) are\nrequired to explain the difference between the two quantities. We use the\nderived stellar mass and maximum rotational velocity Vmax from the modeling to\nconstruct for the first time the stellar mass Tully-Fisher relation at z ~ 2.2.\nThe relation obtained shows a slope similar to what is observed at lower\nredshift, but we detect an evolution of the zero point. We find that at z ~ 2.2\nthere is an offset in log(M*) for a given rotational velocity of 0.41+-0.11\nwith respect to the local Universe. This result is consistent with the\npredictions of the latest N-body/hydrodynamical simulations of disk formation\nand evolution, which invoke gas accretion onto the forming disk in filaments\nand cooling flows. This scenario is in agreement with other dynamical evidence\nfrom SINS, where gas accretion from the halo is required to reproduce the\nobserved properties of a large fraction of the z ~ 2 galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Feb 2009 21:07:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-15"}

The success rate for identifying LBGs\nas NUV-dropouts at 1.5<z<2.7 is 86%. The rest-frame UV (1700AA) luminosity\nfunction (LF) is constructed from the photometric sample with corrections for\nstellar contamination and z<1.5 interlopers. The LF is 1.7+/-0.1 times higher\nthan those of z~2 BXs and z~3 LBGs. Three explanations were considered, and it\nis argued that significantly underestimating low-z contamination or effective\ncomoving volume is unlikely: the former would be inconsistent with the\nspectroscopic sample at 93% confidence, and the second explanation would not\nresolve the discrepancy. The third scenario is that different photometric\nselection of the samples yields non-identical galaxy populations, such that\nsome BX galaxies are LBGs and vice versa. This argument is supported by a\nhigher surface density of LBGs at all magnitudes while the redshift\ndistribution of the two populations is nearly identical.

Magnetic fluctuations range from highly\ncoherent, often multi-frequency, to approaching broad-band (df/f ~ 0.02-0.5),\nin the range 1-200 kHz. Application of datamining techniques to a wide range of\nconfigurations classifies these fluctuations and extracts poloidal and toroidal\nmode numbers, revealing that a significant class of fluctuations exhibit\nscaling which is i) Alfvenic with electron density (within a constant factor)\nand ii) shear Alfvenic in rotational transform.

Computed results show excellent\nagreement with experimental data for a wide diameter and temperature range\n(25-350 K), and successfully predict the extraordinarily low thermal\nconductivity of 2 W.m^{-1}.K^{-1} at room temperature in rough-etched 50 nm\nsilicon nanowires.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Feb 2009 01:19:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Spatially resolved near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy\nindicate that the luminosity and temperature ratios of the system are near\nunity. From optical and near-infrared spectroscopy, we determine a composite\nspectral type of M6 for the system. Gravity-sensitive spectral features in the\nspectra of 2M2234+4041AB are best matched to those of young objects (~1 Myr\nold). A comparison of the Teff and age of 2M2234+4041AB to evolutionary models\nindicates the mass of each component is 0.10 (+0.075-0.04) Msun. Emission lines\nof H alpha in the composite optical spectrum of the system and Br gamma in\nspatially resolved near-IR spectra of the two components indicate that the\nsystem is actively accreting. Both components of the system have IR excesses,\nindicating that they both harbor circumstellar disks.

In the\ncoming decade, non-Gaussianity, i.e., the study of non-Gaussian contributions\nto the correlations of cosmological fluctuations, will become an important\nprobe of both the early and the late Universe. Specifically, it will play a\nleading role in furthering our understanding of two fundamental aspects of\ncosmology and astrophysics: (i) the physics of the very early universe that\ncreated the primordial seeds for large-scale structures, and (ii) the\nsubsequent growth of structures via gravitational instability and gas physics\nat later times. To date, observations of fluctuations in the Cosmic Microwave\nBackground (CMB) and the Large-Scale Structure of the Universe (LSS) have\nfocused largely on the Gaussian contribution as measured by the two-point\ncorrelations (or the power spectrum) of density fluctuations. However, an even\ngreater amount of information is contained in non-Gaussianity and a large\ndiscovery space therefore still remains to be explored. Many observational\nprobes can be used to measure non-Gaussianity, including CMB, LSS,\ngravitational lensing, Lyman-alpha forest, 21-cm fluctuations, and the\nabundance of rare objects such as clusters of galaxies and high-redshift\ngalaxies. Not only does the study of non-Gaussianity maximize the science\nreturn from a plethora of present and future cosmological experiments and\nobservations, but it also carries great potential for important discoveries in\nthe coming decade.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Feb 2009 05:24:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 7 Mar 2009 02:09:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 14 Mar 2009 20:51:38 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 19 Apr 2009 15:42:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-19"}

Abstract stochastic calculus immediately gives us\ngeneral results about existence and uniqueness in law and invariant probability\ndistributions when they exist. These invariant distributions are probability\nmeasures on the $n$-dimensional space and can be extremely resistant to a more\ndetailed understanding. To have a better analysis, we construct a polyhedra\nsuch that the inward normal at its surface is given by the drift function and\nshow that the finer structures of the invariant probability measure is\nintertwined with the geometry of the polyhedra. We show that several natural\ninteracting Brownian particle models can thus be analyzed by studying the\ncombinatorial fan generated by the drift function, particularly when these are\nsimplicial. This is the case when the polyhedra is a polytope that is invariant\nunder a Coxeter group action, which leads to an explicit description of the\ninvariant measures in terms of iid Exponential random variables. Another class\nof examples is furnished by interactions indexed by weighted graphs all of\nwhich generate simplicial polytopes with $n !$ faces.

For this, it is first necessary to review previous methods to\napply QCD perturbation theory at low spacelike momentum scales, where the\ninfluence of the Landau singularities becomes inevitable. Several concepts are\nconsidered and their limitations are pointed out. The usefulness of FAPT is\ndiscussed in terms of two characteristic hadronic quantities: the\nperturbatively calculable part of the pion's electromagnetic form factor in the\nspacelike region and the Higgs-boson decay into a $b\\bar b$ pair in the\ntimelike region. In the first case, the focus is on the optimization of the\nprediction with respect to the choice of the renormalization scheme and the\ndependence on the renormalization and the factorization scales. The second case\nserves to show that the application of FAPT to this reaction reaches already at\nthe four-loop level an accuracy of the order of 1%, avoiding difficulties\ninherent in the standard perturbative expansion. The obtained results are\ncompared with estimates from fixed-order and contour-improved QCD perturbation\ntheory. Using the brand-new Higgs mass value of about 125 GeV, measured at the\nLarge Hadron Collider (CERN), a prediction for $\\Gamma_{H\\to b\\bar{b}}=2.4 \\pm\n0.15 {\\rm MeV}$ is extracted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Feb 2009 14:54:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 7 Mar 2009 17:21:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 9 May 2013 16:33:55 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2016 11:01:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-11"}

Owing to the symmetry considerations, the microwave-induced\ntriplet-singlet transitions of atomic pairs in the fully spin-polarized sample\nare forbidden. The apparent nonzero shift is associated with the\ndensity-dependent wall shift of the hyperfine constant and the pressure shift\ndue to the presence of H atoms in the hyperfine state $a$ not involved in the\nobserved $b\\to c$ transition. The interaction of adsorbed atoms with one\nanother effectively decreases the binding energy and, consequently, the wall\nshift by the amount proportional to their density. The pressure shift of the\n$b\\to c$ resonance comes from the fact that the impurity $a$-state atoms\ninteract differently with the initial $b$-state and final $c$-state atoms and\nis also linear in density. The net effect of the two contributions, both\nspecific for 2D hydrogen, is comparable with the experimental observation. To\nour knowledge, this is the first mentioning of the density-dependent wall\nshift.

This strategy offers a tremendous gain in\ncomputational power and extracts all the needed information from the raw NRG\ndata without {\\it a priori} knowledge of the various energy scales at play. As\nan application we investigate with high precision the crossover from coherent\nto incoherent dynamics in the spin boson model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Feb 2009 14:03:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Mar 2009 13:20:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
