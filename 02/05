Imaging was obtained from X-ray to radio wavelengths, and a\ncomprehensive set of multi-band (w2m2w1u'g'r'i'UBVYJHKs) light curves and\noptical spectroscopy is presented. A virtually complete bolometric light curve\nis derived, from which we infer a (56)Ni-mass of 0.06 M_sun. The early spectrum\nstrongly resembles SN 2005bf and exhibits high-velocity features of CaII and\nH_alpha; during late epochs the spectrum shows evidence of a ejecta-wind\ninteraction. Nebular emission lines have similar widths and exhibit profiles\nthat indicate a lack of major asymmetry in the ejecta. Late phase spectra are\nmodeled with a non-LTE code, from which we find (56)Ni, O and total-ejecta\nmasses (excluding He) to be 0.06, 0.2 and 0.42 M_sun, respectively, below 4,500\nkm/s. The (56)Ni mass confirms results obtained from the bolometric light\ncurve. The oxygen abundance suggests the progenitor was most likely a ~3.3\nM_sun He core star that evolved from a zero-age-main-sequence mass of 10-13\nM_sun. The explosion energy is determined to be ~10^50 erg, and the mass-loss\nrate of the progenitor is constrained from X-ray and radio observations to be\n<~10^-6 M_sun/yr. SN 2007Y is among the least energetic normal Type Ib\nsupernovae ever studied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Feb 2009 16:48:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 2009 12:39:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

The non-equilibrium excitation of interacting\nscalar fields often evolves into infra-red (IR) and ultra-violet (UV)\ncascading, resulting in an intermediate scaling regime. We observe elements of\nthis phenomenon in a simple model with inflaton \\phi and iso-inflaton \\chi\nfields interacting during inflation via the coupling g^2 (\\phi-\\phi_0)^2\n\\chi^2. Iso-inflaton particles are created during inflation when they become\ninstantaneously massless at \\phi=\\phi_0, with occupation numbers not exceeding\nunity. We point out that very quickly the produced \\chi particles become heavy\nand their multiple re-scatterings off the homogeneous condensate \\phi(t)\ngenerates bremschtrahlung radiation of light inflaton IR fluctuations with high\noccupation numbers. The subsequent evolution of these IR fluctuations is\nqualitatively similar to that of the usual inflationary fluctuations, but their\ninitial amplitude is different. The IR cascading generates a bump-shaped\ncontribution to the cosmological curvature fluctuations, which can even\ndominate over the usual fluctuations for g^2>0.06. The IR cascading curvature\nfluctuations are significantly non-gaussian and the strength and location of\nthe bump are model-dependent, through g^2 and \\phi_0. The effect from IR\ncascading fluctuations is significantly larger than that from the momentary\nslowing-down of \\phi(t). With a sequence of such bursts of particle production,\nthe superposition of the bumps can lead to a new broad band non-gaussian\ncomponent of cosmological fluctuations added to the usual fluctuations. Such a\nsequence of particle creation events can, but need not, lead to trapped\ninflation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Feb 2009 20:55:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2009 14:13:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-02"}

The first step to\nbuilding merger histories of dark matter haloes and their subhaloes is to\nidentify these structures in each of the time outputs (snapshots) produced by\nthe simulation.

This is rooted in the\ncomplexity of the merging trees which have to depict an inherently dynamical\nprocess from the partial temporal information contained in the collection of\ninstantaneous snapshots available from the N-body simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Feb 2009 16:16:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2009 15:16:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-03"}

In the absence of correlation the cat score\nreduces to the standard t-score. Moreover, using the cat score it is\nstraightforward to evaluate groups of features (i.e. gene sets). For\ncomputation of the cat score from small sample data we propose a shrinkage\nprocedure. In a comparative study comprising six different synthetic and\nempirical correlation structures we show that the cat score improves estimation\nof gene orderings and leads to higher power for fixed true discovery rate, and\nvice versa.

It is\nwell known that the former cost generates movements with smooth dynamics. A\nspecial attention is devoted to the latter. The optimal control theory shows\nthat minimizing the energy consumption results in actuating inputs of\nbang-off-bang type producing momentum impulses. When achieving dynamic\nsynthesis, this criterion makes necessary to account for bounds set on driving\ntorques. Moreover, when dealing with one-sided contacts, as in floor\nhandstands, the unilaterality of contact forces must be explicitly accounted\nfor since it tends to be infringed by impulsive efforts. Numerical simulations\nof these formal properties are carried out using a parametric optimization\ntechnique, and considering the raising phase of floor handstands. It is shown\nthat the energetic criterion tends to generate movements which exhibit\nsimilarities with their real counterpart performed by an expert gymnast.\nConversely, the sthenic criterion produces movements quite different. But, a\nsalient fact is that these ones proved to be easier to perform by young\nbeginners. As a result, they could help to coach novice gymnasts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Feb 2009 18:29:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-05"}

This radiation is a key ingredient to\nunderstand the origin of the high energy emission of blazars, from the X-ray to\nthe gamma-ray energy band. These external radiation fields control the amount\nof the inverse Compton radiation with respect to the synchrotron flux.\nTherefore the predicted spectral energy distribution (SED) will depend on where\nthe jet dissipates part of its energy to produce the observed radiation.

This is more so for large black hole masses. Dissipation\ntaking place beyond the broad line region is particularly interesting, since it\naccounts in a simple way for the largest inverse Compton to synchrotron flux\nratios accompanied by an extremely hard X-ray spectrum.

We have performed\nN-body simulations with and without a gaseous component. In the second case\nstar formation/feedback recipes have also been implemented to create new\nstellar populations. As in many previous studies, in our N-body collisionless\nsimulation, the B/PS is due to the classical break in the z mirror symmetry\nlasting roughly 200 Myr. When a gaseous component and star formation recipes\nare added to the simulation, the bulge-growing mechanism is quite different.\nThe young stellar population that is born in the thin gaseous disc rapidly\npopulates vertical resonant orbits triggered by the combined effects of the\nlinear horizontal and vertical ILRs. This leads to a B/PS bulge mainly made of\nstellar material younger than the surrounding population. The non-linear\nanalysis of the orbital structure shows that the main orbit family responsible\nfor the B/PS is not the same in the two cases. The 2:2:1 orbits prevail in the\ncollisionless simulation whereas additional asymmetrical families contribute to\nthe B/PS if a dissipative component is present and can form new stars. We found\nthat 2:3:1 and 2:5:1 orbits trap a significant fraction of the mass. A flat\nringed discy stellar component also appears simultaneously with the thickening\nof the young population. It is due to the star formation in a nuclear gaseous\ndisc located in the central kpc, inside the ILR, and accumulated there by the\ntorques exerted by the large-scale bar. Remarkably, it remains flat throughout\nthe simulation although it develops a nuclear bar, leading to a double-barred\ngalaxy. We predict that two populations of B/PS bulges could exist and even\ncoexist in the same galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Feb 2009 21:12:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-06"}

Two\ndiscrete and luminous star-forming regions are detected in the south of the\ngalaxy that appear to be associated with massive star clusters previously\nidentified at optical wavelengths. However, the remaining optically-identified\nmassive star clusters are not clearly associated with radio emission (either\nthermal or non-thermal) down to the sensitivity limits of these radio data. The\nspectral energy distributions of the two radio-detected clusters are consistent\nwith being purely thermal, and the entire region has an inferred ionizing flux\nof ~1.2 x 10^ 53 s^-1, which is equivalent to ~12,000 \"typical\" O-type stars\n(type O7.5 V).

In\nthis regime, large-scale turbulent compressions in the stable warm neutral\nmedium (WNM) dominate the clump-formation process rather than the linear\ndevelopent of TI. Cold clumps formed by this mechanism are often bounded by\nsharp density and temperature discontinuities, which however are not contact\ndiscontinuities as in the classical 2-phase model, but rather \"phase transition\nfronts\", across which there is net mass and momentum flux from the WNM into the\nclumps. The clumps grow mainly by accretion through their boundaries, are in\nboth thermal and ram pressure balance with their surroundings, and are\ninternally turbulent as well, thus also having significant density fluctuations\ninside. The temperature and density of the cold and warm gas around the phase\ntransition fronts fluctuate with time and location due to fluctuations in the\nturbulent pressure. Moreover, shock-compressed diffuse unstable gas can remain\nin the unstable regime for up to a few Myr before it undergoes a phase\ntransition to the cold phase. These processes populate the classically\nforbidden density and temperature ranges. Since gas at all temperatures appears\nto be present in bi- or tri-stable turbulence, we conclude that the word\n\"phase\" applies only locally, surrounding phase transition sites in the gas.\nGlobally, the word \"phase\" must relax its meaning to simply denote a certain\ntemperature or density range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Feb 2009 23:47:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-06"}

A distinctly different\nquantum behavior is found compared to that of circular single quantum dots. As\na function of the magnetic field, the energy spectra exhibit a low-energy band\nconsisting of a group of six states, with the number six being a consequence of\nthe conservation of the total spin of the four electrons and the ensuing spin\ndegeneracies. These six states appear to cross at a single value of the\nmagnetic field, with the crossing point becoming sharper for larger interdot\ndistances. As the strength of the Coulomb repulsion increases, the six states\ntend to become degenerate and a well defined energy gap separates them from the\nhigher-in-energy excited states.\n  The appearance of the low-energy band is a consequence of the formation of a\nWigner supermolecule, with the four electrons (two in each dot) being localized\nat the vertices of a rectangular parallelogram. Using the spin-resolved\npair-correlation functions, one can map the EXD many-body wave functions onto\nthe spin functions associated with the four localized electrons.

Star-forming galaxies are common, as found in about 52% LSBGs.\nWe find, contrary to some of the previous claims, that the fraction of galaxies\ncontaining an AGN is significantly lower than that found in nearby normal\ngalaxies of high surface brightness. This is qualitatively in line with the\nfinding of Impey et al. (2001). This result holds true even within each\nmorphological type from Sa to Sc. LSBGs having larger central stellar velocity\ndispersions, or larger physical sizes, tend to have a higher chance to harbor\nan AGN. For three AGNs with broad emission lines, the black hole masses\nestimated from the emission lines are broadly consistent with the well known\nM-$\\sigma_\\ast$ relation established for normal galaxies and AGNs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Feb 2009 08:29:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2009 09:36:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

This object has been claimed to host a\nsuper-massive binary black hole (Rodriguez et al. 2006). The main features in\nthe absorption profile are two components, separated by ~1100 km/s. The HI\nabsorption in 4C37.11 is unusual because it is the first case where such broad\nabsorption is found to be centred on the systemic velocity of the host galaxy\nand not asymmetric and blueshifted as is seen in all other galaxies with broad\nHI absorption. Given the large width of the absorption, we suggest that a\npossible explanation for the extreme properties of the HI absorption is that it\nis the kinematic signature of a binary black hole. If this interpretation is\ncorrect, the combined black hole mass derived from the absorption profile is\nconsistent with that derived from the luminosity of the spheroid.

Furthermore, the behaviour of random walks on directed\ncovers of infinite graphs is more subtle. We provide a classification in terms\nof recurrence and transience and point out that the critical random walk may be\nrecurrent or transient.

Here we show that this phenomenon is said to be a refinement of the\nSanchez's classical result in their book (Vibration and coupling of continuous\nsystems, Springer-Verlag -1989-, paragraph 9.3) where it was established, using\nasymptotic analysis, that in the case of a light loading conditions \"the\nscattering frequencies of a fluid loaded elastic structure (ie the resonance\nfrequencies) are nearly the real eigenfrequencies of the elastic body alone and\nthe complex scattering frequencies of the fluid with a rigid solid\". A\ntheoretical explanation of the observed phenomenon of multiple resonance is\ngiven using classical results of the distribution of zeros of entire functions.\nIt is established that every single in vacuo resonance frequency of a\nrectangular plate is transformed into an infinite number of resonances when the\nfluid-loading is accounted for.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Feb 2009 15:30:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-06"}
