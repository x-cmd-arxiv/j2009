This flow, which is\nalso known as the Archontis flow, is a generalization of the\nArnold--Beltrami--Childress flow, but with the cosine terms omitted. The\npresence of cross helicity leads to a mean-field dynamo effect that is known as\nthe Yoshizawa effect. Direct numerical simulations of such flows demonstrate\nthe presence of magnetic fields on scales larger than the scale of the flow.\nContrary to earlier expectations, the Yoshizawa effect is found to be\nproportional to the mean magnetic field and can therefore lead to its\nexponential instead of just linear amplification for magnetic Reynolds numbers\nthat exceed a certain critical value. Unlike $\\alpha$ effect dynamos, it is\nfound that the Yoshizawa effect is not noticeably constrained by the presence\nof a conservation law. It is argued that this is due to the presence of a\nforcing term in the momentum equation which leads to a nonzero correlation with\nthe magnetic field. Finally, the application to energy convergence in solar\nwind turbulence is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Feb 2009 17:34:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2009 04:21:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-10"}

We introduce the\noptical tools that complete the coherence state quantum computation model and\ngive the desired circuits. The proposed system can admit a number of users\nabove the optimal limit at the cost of a degradation of the transmitted data.\nIn this and some other aspects, it can be regarded as a quantum analogue of\nclassical Code Division Multiple Access techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Feb 2009 17:15:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-28"}

We computed models with and without galactic winds: we found that\nmodels without wind predict a too large current SNIa rate.

Moreover models without wind predict a large current SNII\nrate, too large even if compared with the recent GALEX data.

A cosmologically derived\ninfall law for an elliptical galaxy cannot reproduce all the chemical\nconstraints given by the observations. The problem resides in the fact that the\ncosmologically derived infall law implies a slow gas accretion with consequent\nstar formation rate active for a long period.

Both the classical core accretion and\nthe gravitational instability model for planet formation are hard-pressed to\nform long-period planets in situ.

For those sources with\nconstrained binary system parameters, we examine the distribution of spin\nparameters versus black hole mass, binary mass ratio, and orbital period.

The phenomenology related to these\nmodels is various and the next future experiments could in principle\ndiscriminate among these proposals.

To do this, we extract the optimal couplings for\nsubsets of size up to 200 neurons, essentially exactly, using Boltzmann\nlearning. We then study the quality of several approximate methods for finding\nthe couplings by comparing their results with those found from Boltzmann\nlearning. Two of these methods- inversion of the TAP equations and an\napproximation proposed by Sessak and Monasson- are remarkably accurate. Using\nthese approximations for larger subsets of neurons, we find that extracting\ncouplings using data from a subset smaller than the full network tends\nsystematically to overestimate their magnitude.

The accelerated electrons assume\na Maxwellian distribution at low energies and possible energetic power law\ntail. These assumptions yield to a wealth of spectra, which we study in\ndetails. We identify critical values of the magnetic field, and five transition\nfrequencies in the spectra. In particular, we show that: (I) the decay of the\nmagnetic field along the jet enables, for wide jets, production of flat radio\nspectra without the need for electrons re-acceleration along the jet. (II) An\nincrease of the magnetic field above a critical value of ~10^5 G leads to a\nsharp decrease in the flux at the radio band, while the flux at higher\nfrequencies saturates to a constant value.

The proper description of these media in stationary cases requires to\nsolve linear systems of thousands or more rate equations. A possible\nsimplification for this arduous numerical task may lie in some type of\nstatistical average, such as configuration or superconfiguration average.\nHowever to assess the validity of this procedure and to handle cases where\nisolated lines play an important role, it may be important to deal with\ndetailed levels systems. This involves matrices with sometimes billions of\nelements, which are rather sparse but still involve thousands of diagonals. We\npropose here a numerical algorithm based on the LU decomposition for such\nlinear systems. This method turns out to be orders of magnitude faster than the\ntraditional Gauss elimination. And at variance with alternate methods based on\nconjugate gradients or minimization, no convergence or accuracy issues have\nbeen faced. Some examples are discussed in connection with the krypton and\ntungsten cases discussed at the last NLTE meeting. Furthermore, to assess the\nvalidity of configuration average, several criteria are discussed. While a\ncriterion based on detailed balance is relevant in cases not too far from LTE\nbut insufficient otherwise, an alternate criterion based on the use of a\nfictive configuration temperature is proposed and successfully tested. It\nappears that detailed calculations are sometimes necessary, which supports the\nsearch for an efficient solver as the one proposed here.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Feb 2009 11:35:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

With the goal of\nunderstanding the duration of typical star formation episodes in galaxies at\nz>4, we examine the distribution of stellar masses and ages as a function of\ncosmic time. We find that at a fixed rest-UV luminosity, the average stellar\nmasses and ages of galaxies do not increase significantly between z~6 and 4. In\norder to maintain this near equilibrium in the average properties of high\nredshift LBGs, we argue that there must be a steady flux of young,\nnewly-luminous objects at each successive redshift. When considered along with\nthe short duty cycles inferred from clustering measurements, these results may\nsuggest that galaxies are undergoing star formation episodes lasting only\nseveral hundred million years. In contrast to the unchanging relationship\nbetween the average stellar mass and rest-UV luminosity, we find that the\nnumber density of massive galaxies increases considerably with time over 4<z<6.\nGiven this rapid increase of UV luminous massive galaxies, we explore the\npossibility that a significant fraction of massive (M*>1e11 Msun) z~2-3 distant\nred galaxies (DRGs) were in part assembled in an LBG phase at earlier times.\nIntegrating the growth in the stellar mass function of actively forming LBGs\nover 4<z<6 down to z~2, we find that z>3 LBGs could have contributed\nsignificantly to the quiescent DRG population, indicating that the intense\nstar-forming systems probed by current sub-millimeter observations are not the\nonly route toward the assembly of DRGs at z~2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Feb 2009 12:28:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-15"}

In both cases an adjustable parameter allows\nto tune the disorder so as to yield a transition from a spin-glass ordered\nground state to a ferromagnetic groundstate. We formulate an auxiliary\ngraph-theoretical problem in which domain walls are given by undirected\nshortest paths with possibly negative distances. Due to the details of the\nmapping, standard shortest-path algorithms cannot be applied. To solve such\nshortest-path problems we have to apply minimum-weight perfect-matching\nalgorithms. We first locate the critical values of the disorder parameters,\nwhere the ferromagnet to spin-glass transition occurs for the two types of the\ndisorder. For certain values of the disorder parameters close to the respective\ncritical point, we investigate the system size dependence of the width of the\nthe average domain-wall energy (~L^\\theta) and the average domain-wall length\n(~L^df). Performing a finite-size scaling analysis for systems with a side\nlength up to L=512, we find that both exponents remain constant in the\nspin-glass phase, i.e. \\theta ~- 0.28 and df~1.275. This is consistent with\nconformal field theory, where it seems to be possible to relate the exponents\nfrom the analysis of Stochastic Loewner evolutions (SLEs) via\ndf-1=3/[4(3+\\theta)]. Finally, we characterize the transition in terms of\nferromagnetic clusters of spins that form, as one proceeds from spin-glass\nordered to ferromagnetic ground states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Feb 2009 15:47:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 May 2009 15:03:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-06"}

The results of numerical 2-D MHD\nsimulation of solar magnetogranulation are used for this. In their properties,\nthe synthetic unusual profiles with extremely asymmetry are similar to the\nunusual profiles observed with a spatial resolution better than 1\" in the\nnetwork and internetwork regions. According to our results the unusual profiles\nmostly appear in clusters along the polarity inversion lines in the regions of\nweak magnetic fields with mixed polarity. As a rule, they are located at the\nedges of granules and lanes, and sometimes they are met close to strong\nmagnetic field concentrations with high velocity and magnetic field strength\ngradients. They turned out to appear as clusters in the regions where large\ngranules disintegrate and new magnetic flux tubes begin to form. The unusual\n$V$ profiles may have from one to six lobes. The one-lobe and multilobe\nprofiles are of the same origin. The processing causing the extreme asymmetry\nof the profiles are characterized by one or several polarity reversal along the\nline of sight as well as by complicated velocity and field strength gradients.\nThe greater the number of profile lobes, the greater is the probability of the\nfield gradient sign change. Hence it follows that the magnetic field should be\nvery complicated in the regions of formation of extremely asymmetric $V$\nprofiles. This is confirmed by immediate results of MHD granulation\nsimulations, which demonstrate the formation of vortices and turbulence by the\nvelocity shear at down draft edges. These processes add complexity to the\nmagnetic field structure by mixing field polarities, particularly at the edges\nof granules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Feb 2009 15:48:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Feb 2009 11:43:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-19"}
