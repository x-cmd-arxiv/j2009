We implement observationally-normalized\nrelations between dark matter halo mass, stellar mass, and cold gas mass to\nexplore these mappings, with specific emphasis on the correlation between\ndifferent definitions of a major galaxy merger. We always define a major merger\nby a mass ratio m/M>0.3, but allow the masses used to compute this ratio to be\ndefined in one of three ways: dark matter halo masses, galaxy stellar masses,\nor galaxy baryonic masses (stars and cold gas). We find that the merger ratio\nassigned to any particular merger event depends strongly on which of these\nmasses is used, with the mapping between different mass ratio definitions\nshowing strong evolution with halo mass and redshift. For example, major dark\nmatter mergers (>0.3) in small galaxies (M_DM < 10^11 Msun) typically\ncorrespond to very minor stellar mergers (<1/20). These mergers contain\nsignificant dark matter mass, and should cause noticable morphological\ndisruption to the primary galaxy, even though there is no observable bright\ncompanion. In massive galaxies, there is an opposite effect, with bright\ncompanion galaxies corresponding to only minor dark matter mergers. We\nemphasize that great care must be taken when comparing mergers based on\ndifferent mass ratio definitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Feb 2009 20:51:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-16"}

The\nwalls of the duct perpendicular to the magnetic field are perfectly conducting\nwhereas the parallel ones are insulating. In a sufficiently strong magnetic\nfield, the flow consists of two jets at the insulating walls and a\nnear-stagnant core. We use a vector stream function formulation and Chebyshev\ncollocation method to solve the eigenvalue problem for small-amplitude\nperturbations. Due to the two-fold reflection symmetry of the base flow the\ndisturbances with four different parity combinations over the duct\ncross-section decouple from each other. Magnetic field renders the flow in a\nsquare duct linearly unstable at the Hartmann number Ha 5.7 with respect to a\ndisturbance whose vorticity component along the magnetic field is even across\nthe field and odd along it. For this mode, the minimum of the critical Reynolds\nnumber Re_c 2018, based on the maximal velocity, is attained at Ha ~ 10.\nFurther increase of the magnetic field stabilises this mode with Re_c growing\napproximately as Ha. For Ha>40, the spanwise parity of the most dangerous\ndisturbance reverses across the magnetic field. At Ha ~ 46 a new pair of most\ndangerous disturbances appears with the parity along the magnetic field being\nopposite to that of the previous two modes. The critical Reynolds number, which\nis very close for both of these modes, attains a minimum Re_c ~ 1130 at Ha ~ 70\nand increases as Re_c ~ Ha^1/2 for Ha >> 1.

With a cumulative ~1 Ms Chandra ACIS observing time, we detect 90-170\nLMXBs within the D25 ellipse of each galaxy. Cross-correlating Chandra X-ray\nsources and HST optical sources, we identify 75 globular cluster (GC) LMXBs and\n112 field LMXBs. In the low luminosity range allowed by our deeper data (LX < 5\nx 1037 erg s-1), we find a significant relative lack of GC-LMXBs, when compared\nwith field sources. Using the co-added sample from the three galaxies, we find\nthat the incompleteness-corrected X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs) of GC and\nfield LMXBs differ at ~4# significance at LX < 5 x 1037 erg s-1. As previously\nreported, these XLFs are consistent at higher luminosities. Our observations\nmay indicate a potential predominance of GC-LMXBs with donors evolved beyond\nthe main sequence, when compared to current models, but their efficient\nformation requires relatively high initial binary fractions in clusters. The\nfield LMXB XLF can be fitted with either a single power-law model plus a\nlocalized excess at a luminosity of 5-6 x 1037 erg s-1, or a broken power-law\nwith a similar low-luminosity break. This XLF may be explained with\nNS-red-giant LMXBs, contributing to ~15% of total LMXBs population at ~5x1037\nerg s-1. The difference in the GC and field XLFs is consistent with different\norigins and/or evolutionary paths between the two LMXB populations, although a\nfraction of the field sources are likely to have originated in GCs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Feb 2009 16:59:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2009 19:01:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-28"}

An interferometer is\nnecessary as a `spatial filter' in this region of space because of the\nconfusion with interstellar CO emission.\n  Results: Towards two of the stars, CO emission was detected with positions\nand radial velocities coinciding within the statistical errors with the\ncorresponding data of the associated OH sources. However, for one of the stars\nthe line profile is not what one expects for an unresolved expanding\ncircumstellar envelope.

With the approximation that the total velocity of the\n$q\\bar{q}e$ system is conserved at (electromagnetic) interaction vertices this\nsimplifies to an eigenvalue problem for a Bakamjian-Thomas type mass operator.\nAfter elimination of the $q\\bar{q}e\\gamma$ channel the electromagnetic meson\ncurrent and form factor can be directly read off from the one-photon-exchange\noptical potential.

However such theories have either violated\nconservation laws, or are highly non-local. Here, we show that the tension\nbetween conservation laws and locality can be circumvented by constructing a\nrelational theory of information destruction. In terms of conservation laws, we\nderive a generalisation of Noether's theorem for general theories, and show\nthat symmetries imply a strong restriction on the type of evolution\npermissable. With respect to locality, we distinguish violations of causality\nfrom the creation or destruction of space-like seperated correlations. We show\nthat violations of causality need not occur in a relational framework, although\none can have situations where correlations decay faster than one might\notherwise expect or can be created over spatial distances. This creation or\ndestruction of correlations cannot be used to signal superluminally, and thus\nno violation of causality occurs.

To this end, we present a study of\nthe RSGs' surface abundances using a combination of high-resolution H-band\nspectroscopy and spectral synthesis analysis. We provide abundance measurements\nfor elements C, O, Si, Mg, Ti, and Fe. We find that the surface abundances of\nthe stars studied are consistent with CNO burning and deep, rotationally\nenhanced mixing. The average a/Fe ratios of the clusters are solar, consistent\nwith a thin-disk population. However, we find significantly sub-solar Fe/H\nratios for each cluster, a result which strongly contradicts a simple\nextrapolation of the Galactic metallicity gradient to lower Galacto-centric\ndistances. We suggest that a simple one-dimensional parameterization of the\nGalaxy's abundance patterns is insufficient at low Galactocentric distances, as\nlarge azimuthal variations may be present. Indeed, we show that the abundances\nof O, Si and Mg are consistent with independent measurements of objects in\nsimilar locations in the Galaxy. In combining our results with other data in\nthe literature, we present evidence for large-scale (~kpc) azimuthal variations\nin abundances at Galacto-centric distances of 3-5kpc.

Previously, it was a common practice to ray-trace\nphotons assuming that they are emitted from the Kerr geometry equatorial plane,\nz = 0. We show that the spectra calculated with this assumption differ from\nthese calculated under the assumption that photons are emitted from the actual\nsurface of the disc, z = H(r). This implies that a knowledge of the location of\nthe thin disks effective photosphere is relevant for calculating the spectra.\nIn this paper we investigate, in terms of a simple toy model, a possible\ninfluence of the (unknown, and therefore ad hoc assumed) vertical dissipation\nprofiles on the vertical structure of the disk and thus on the location of the\neffective photosphere, and on the observed spectra. For disks with moderate and\nhigh mass accretion rates (\\dot m>0.01\\dot m_C) we find that the photosphere\nlocation in the inner, radiation pressure dominated, disk region (where most of\nthe radiation comes from) does not depend on the dissipation profile and\ntherefore emerging disk spectra are insensitive to the choice of the\ndissipation function. For lower accretion rates the photosphere location\ndepends on the assumed vertical dissipation profile down to the disk inner\nedge, but the dependence is very weak and thus of minor importance. We conclude\nthat the spectra of optically thick accretion disks around black holes should\nbe calculated with the ray-tracing from the effective photosphere and that,\nfortunately, the choice of a particular vertical dissipation profile does not\nsubstantially influence the calculated spectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Feb 2009 21:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

In our computed lightcurves, a very sharp jet break is\nseen and the post-break lightcurves are steeper than analytic predictions.

Hanson introduced a market maker derived from\nthe logarithmic scoring rule, and later Chen and Pennock developed a cost\nfunction formulation for the market maker. On the other hand, the SCPM model of\nPeters et al. is based on ideas from a call auction setting using a convex\noptimization model. In this work, we develop a unified framework that bridges\nthese seemingly unrelated models for centrally organizing contingent claim\nmarkets. The framework, developed as a generalization of the SCPM, will support\nmany desirable properties such as proper scoring, truthful bidding (in a myopic\nsense), efficient computation, and guarantees on worst case loss. In fact, our\nunified framework will allow us to express various proper scoring rules,\nexisting or new, from classical utility functions in a convex optimization\nproblem representing the market organizer. Additionally, we utilize concepts\nfrom duality to show that the market model is equivalent to a risk minimization\nproblem where a convex risk measure is employed. This will allow us to more\nclearly understand the differences in the risk attitudes adopted by various\nmechanisms, and particularly deepen our intuition about popular mechanisms like\nHanson's market-maker. In aggregate, we believe this work advances our\nunderstanding of the objectives that the market organizer is optimizing in\npopular pari-mutuel mechanisms by recasting them into one unified framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Feb 2009 03:11:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-17"}

The Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) is on\nthe path to be equipped with instruments capable to combine between four to six\ntelescopes. In the framework of the VLTI second generation instruments Gravity\nand VSI, we propose a new beam combining concept using Integrated Optics (IO)\ntechnologies with a novel ABCD-like fringe encoding scheme. Our goal is to\ndemonstrate that IO-based combination brings considerable advantages in terms\nof instrumental design and performance. We therefore aim at giving a full\ncharacterization of an IO beam combiner to establish its performances and check\nits compliance with the specifications of an imaging instrument. Laboratory\nmeasurements were made in the H band with a dedicated testbed. We studied the\nbeam combiners through the analysis of throughput, instrumental visibilities,\nphases and closure phases in wide band as well as with spectral dispersion.\nStudy of the polarization properties is also done. We obtain competitive\nthroughput, high and stable instrumental contrasts, stable but non-zero closure\nphases which we attribute to internal well calibrable optical path differences.\nWe validate a new static and achromatic phase shifting IO function close to the\nnominal 90deg value. All these observables show limited chromaticity over the H\nband range. Our results demonstrate that such ABCD-like beam combiners are\nparticularly well suited to achieve aperture synthesis imaging. This opens the\nway to extend to all near infrared wavelengths and in particular, the K band.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Feb 2009 08:44:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2009 18:42:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

But, his Number-Theoretical achievements\n(See Books 7, 8 and 9 in his magnum opus \\emph{Elements} [1]) are rarely\nspoken. The object of this paper is to affirm the number-theoretical role of\nEuclid and the historical significance of Euclid's algorithm. It is known that\nalmost all elementary number-theoretical texts begin with Division algorithm.\nHowever, Euclid did not do like this. He began his number-theoretical work by\nintroducing his algorithm. We were quite surprised when we began to read the\n\\emph{Elements} for the first time. Nevertheless, one can prove that Euclid's\nalgorithm is essentially equivalent with the Bezout's equation and Division\nalgorithm. Therefore, Euclid has preliminarily established Theory of\nDivisibility and the greatest common divisor. This is the foundation of Number\nTheory. After more than 2000 years, by creatively introducing the notion of\ncongruence, Gauss published his \\emph{Disquisitiones Arithmeticae} in 1801 and\ndeveloped Number Theory as a systematic science. Note also that Euclid's\nalgorithm implies Euclid's first theorem (which is the heart of `the uniqueness\npart' of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic) and Euclid's second theorem\n(which states that there are infinitely many primes). Thus, in the nature of\nthings, Euclid's algorithm is the most important number-theoretical work of\nEuclid. For this reason, we further summarize briefly the influence of Euclid's\nalgorithm. Knuth said `we might call Euclid's method the granddaddy of all\nalgorithms'. Based on our discussion and analysis, it leads to the conclusion\nEuclid's algorithm is the greatest number-theoretical achievement of the\nEuclidean age.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Feb 2009 13:35:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 21 Feb 2010 15:15:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-21"}

We consider initial states which are\nsuperpositions of slowly modulated plane waves, and use the framework of Wiener\nalgebras. A detailed analysis of the corresponding nonlinear wave mixing\nphenomena is given, including a geometric interpretation on the resonance\nstructure for cubic nonlinearities.
