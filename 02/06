Here I model the MRI driven dynamo\nas a large scale dynamo driven by the vertical magnetic helicity flux. This\ngrowth is balanced by large scale mixing driven by a secondary instability. The\nsaturated magnetic energy density depends almost linearly on the vertical\nheight of the typical eddies. The MRI can drive eddies with arbitrarily large\nvertical wavenumber, so the eddy thickness is either set by diffusive effects,\nby the magnetic tension of a large scale vertical field component, or by\nmagnetic buoyancy effects. In homogeneous, zero magnetic flux, simulations only\nthe first effect applies and the saturated limit of the dynamo is determined by\nexplicit or numerical diffusion. The exact result depends on the numerical\ndetails, but is consistent with previous work, including the claim that the\nsaturated field energy scales as the gas pressure to the one quarter power\n(which we interpret as an artifact of numerical dissipation). The magnetic\nenergy density in a homogeneous shearing box will tend to zero as the\nresolution of the simulation increases, but this has no consequences for the\ndynamo or for angular momentum transport in real accretion disks. The claim\nthat the saturated state depends on the magnetic Prandtl number may also be an\nartifact of simulations in which microphysical transport coefficients set the\nMRI eddy thickness. Finally, the efficiency of the MRI dynamo is a function of\nthe ratio of the Alfv\\'en velocity to the product of the pressure scale height\nand the local shear. As this approaches unity from below the dynamo reaches\nmaximum efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Feb 2009 17:03:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

When the mass of the single particle is equal to the\nfermion mass, we find an excellent agreement with the exact results of McGuire.\nWhen the mass of the single particle is infinite, we solve exactly the problem\nand find again excellent agreement between approximate results and exact ones.\nThis overall agreement in one dimension gives a strong validation for the\napproximate method applied in three dimensions. Moreover it shows that our\napproximate treatment is excellent for the one dimensional problem in the\ngeneral case with respect to the mass of the single particle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Feb 2009 17:37:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-16"}

Therefore, such a\nclose-in extrasolar planet is not protected by an extended magnetosphere. (b)\nThe small orbital distance of the planet exposes it to a much denser stellar\nwind than that prevailing at larger orbital distances. This dense stellar wind\nleads to additional compression of the magnetosphere, which can further reduce\nthe shielding efficiency against GCRs. In this work, we analyse and compare the\neffect of (a) and (b), showing that the stellar wind variation with orbital\ndistance has little influence on the cosmic ray shielding. Instead, the weak\nshielding of M star planets can be attributed to their small magnetic moment.\nWe further analyse how the planetary mass and composition influence the\nplanetary magnetic moment, and thus modify the cosmic ray shielding efficiency.\nWe show that more massive planets are not necessarily better protected against\ngalactic cosmic rays, but that the planetary bulk composition can play an\nimportant role.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Feb 2009 18:55:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-19"}

Analysis of the promoter\nactivity data using the model yielded the following predictions regarding\nactivation mechanisms: (1) MarA activation of the marRAB, sodA, and micF\npromoters involves a net acceleration of the kinetics of transitions after RNA\npolymerase binding, up to and including promoter escape and message elongation;\n(2) RNA polymerase binds to these promoters with nearly unit occupancy in the\nabsence of MarA, making recruitment of polymerase an insignificant factor in\nactivation of these promoters; and (3) instead of recruitment, activation of\nthe micF promoter might involve a repulsion of polymerase combined with a large\nacceleration of the kinetics of polymerase activity. These predictions are\nconsistent with published chromatin immunoprecipitation assays of interactions\nbetween polymerase and the E. coli chromosome.

The size scale of the typical gas disk is found to\nhave a radius of ~30 pc with a comparable vertical height.

This concept was initially proposed by S\nWright 70 years ago, re-introduced by one of the founders of molecular biology\nand by others in different biological contexts. It was apparently forgotten by\nmainstream modern biologists for many years. Currently, this concept has found\nits increasingly important role in the development of systems biology and the\nmodeling of bionetwork dynamics, from phage lambda genetic switch to endogenous\nnetwork of cancer genesis and progression. It is an ideal quantify to describe\nthe robustness and stability of bionetworks.

Then I will discuss a few\nrecent results, focusing on the work showing the logical consistency of\nadaptive landscape. From the perspective of a working scientist and of what\nneeded for a dynamical theory when confronting empirical data, the adaptive\nlandscape is useful both metaphorically and quantitatively and has captured an\nessential aspect of biological dynamical processes.

Short\nand long GRBs populate different regions of the bolometric fluence-peak energy\nplane, short bursts being less energetic by a factor similar to the ratio of\ntheir durations. If short and long GRBs had similar redshift distributions,\nthey would have similar luminosities yet different energies, which correlate\nwith the peak energy E_peak for the population of long GRBs. We also test\nwhether short GRBs are consistent with the E_peak-E_iso and E_peak-L_iso\ncorrelations for the available sample of short (6 events) and long (92 events)\nGRBs with measured redshifts and E_peak,obs: while short GRBs are inconsistent\nwith the E_peak-E_iso correlation of long GRBs, they could follow the\nE_peak-L_iso correlation of long bursts. All the above indications point to\nshort GRBs being similar to the first phases of long bursts. This suggests that\na similar central engine (except for its duration) operates in GRBs of\ndifferent durations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Feb 2009 21:59:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The detection\nof pulsed radio emission from XTE J0103-728 would make it only the second\nsystem after PSR B1259-63 that is both a Be/X-ray binary and a radio pulsar. We\nobserved XTE J0103-728 in Feb 2008 with the Parkes 64-m radio telescope soon\nafter the identification of the source of X-ray pulsations was reported in\norder to search for corresponding radio pulsations. We used a continuous 6.4\nhour observation with a 256 MHz bandwidth centered at 1390 MHz using the center\nbeam of the Parkes multibeam receiver. In the subsequent data analysis, which\nincluded a folding search, a Fourier search, a fast-folding algorithm search,\nand a single-pulse search, no pulsed signals were found for trial dispersion\nmeasures (DMs) between 0 and 800 pc cm^-3. This DM range easily encompasses the\nexpected values for sources in the SMC. We place an upper limit of ~45 mJy\nkpc^2 on the luminosity of periodic radio emission from XTE J0103-728 at the\nepoch of our observation, and we compare this limit to a range of luminosities\nmeasured for PSR B1259-63, the only Be/X-ray binary currently known to emit\nradio pulses. We also compare our limit to the radio luminosities of neutron\nstars having similarly long spin periods to XTE J0103-728. Since the radio\npulses from PSR B1259-63 are eclipsed and undetectable during the portion of\nthe orbit near periastron, repeated additional radio search observations of XTE\nJ0103-728 may be valuable if it is undergoing similar eclipsing and if such\nobservations are able to sample the orbital phase of this system well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Feb 2009 22:57:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Our\nexpression for $w(a)$ reduces to the previously-derived phantom slow-roll\nresult of Sen and Scherrer in the limit where the potential is flat,\n$(1/V)(dV/d\\phi) \\ll 1$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Feb 2009 00:21:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2009 01:30:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 8 Jun 2009 02:13:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

In a series of NLFFF modeling studies, we have found that NLFFF\nmodels are successful in application to analytic test cases, and relatively\nsuccessful when applied to numerically constructed Sun-like test cases, but\nthey are less successful in application to real solar data. Different NLFFF\nmodels have been found to have markedly different field line configurations and\nto provide widely varying estimates of the magnetic free energy in the coronal\nvolume, when applied to solar data. NLFFF models require consistent, force-free\nvector magnetic boundary data. However, vector magnetogram observations\nsampling the photosphere, which is dynamic and contains significant Lorentz and\nbuoyancy forces, do not satisfy this requirement, thus creating several major\nproblems for force-free coronal modeling efforts.

In both cases, the model can produce some amount of\nabundance gradient, and the gradient is steeper in the early epoch of disk\nevolution. However, we find that when C-KS law is adopted, the classical\nchemical evolution model, which assumes a radial dependent infall time scale,\ncannot produce a sufficiently steep present-day abundance gradient. This\nproblem disappears if we introduce a disk formation time scale, which means\nthat at early times, infalling gas cools down onto the inner disk only, while\nthe outer disk forms later. This kind of model, however, will predict a very\nsteep gradient in the past. When the M-KS law is adopted, the model can\nproperly predict both the current abundance gradient and its time evolution,\nmatching recent observations from planetary nebulae and open clusters along the\nMilky Way disk. Our best model also predicts that outer disk (artificially\ndefined as the disk with $R_g \\ge 8kpc$) has a steeper gradient than the inner\ndisk. The observed outer disk gradients from Cepheids, open clusters and young\nstars show quite controversial results. There are also some hints from Cepheids\nthat the outer disk abundance gradient may have a bimodal distribution. More\ndata is needed in order to clarify the outer disk gradient problem. Our model\ncalculations show that for an individual Milky Way-type galaxy, a better\ndescription of the local star formation is the modified KS law.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Feb 2009 05:47:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

The mixed\nchemistry is derived from the simultaneous detection of PAH features in the\n6-14 micron range and crystalline silicates (CS) beyond 20 microns in the\nSpitzer/IRS spectra. Out of the 26 PNe observed in the GB, 21 show signatures\nof DDC. Our observations reveal that the simultaneous presence of O- and C-rich\ndust features in the IR spectra of [WC]-type PNe is not restricted to late/cool\n[WC]-type stars, as previously suggested in the literature, but is a common\nfeature associated with all [WC]-type PNe. Surprisingly, we found that the DDC\nis seen also in all observed wels, as well as in other PNe with central stars\nbeing neither [WC] nor wels. Most sources observed display CS features in their\nspectra, with only a few PNe exhibiting, in addition, amorphous silicate bands.\nWe appear to detect a recent change of chemistry at the end of the AGB\nevolution in the low-mass, high-metallicity population of GB PNe observed. The\ndeficit of C-rich AGB stars in this environment suggests that the process of\nPAH formation in PNe occurs at the very end of the AGB phase. In addition, the\npopulation of low-mass, O-rich AGB stars in the GB, do not exhibit CS features\nin their spectra. Thus, the high detection rate of DDC that we find cannot be\nexplained by long-lived O-rich (primordial or circumbinary) disks. Our most\nplausible scenario is a final thermal pulse on the AGB (or just after), which\ncould produce enhanced mass loss, capable of removing/mixing (sometimes\ncompletely) the remaining H-rich envelope and exposing the internal C-rich\nlayers, and generating shocks responsible for the silicate crystallization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Feb 2009 10:17:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In this task, it is important to devise\nreasonable approximation schemes that rely on the stoichiometric data only,\nbecause full-scale kinetic approaches are computationally affordable only for\nsmall networks (e.g. red blood cells, about 50 reactions). Methods commonly\nemployed are based on finding the stationary flux configurations that satisfy\nmass-balance conditions for metabolites, often coupling them to local\noptimization rules (e.g. maximization of biomass production) to reduce the size\nof the solution space to a single point. Such methods have been widely applied\nand have proven able to reproduce experimental findings for relatively simple\norganisms in specific conditions.

Energy is transported by a large-scale, steady\ncirculation carrying high entropy matter from the primary to secondary\ncomponent. The circulation is driven by the baroclinic structure of the common\nenvelope, which is a direct consequence of the nonuniform heating at the inner\ncritical Roche lobes due to unequal emergent energy fluxes of the components.\nThe mass stream flowing around the secondary is bound to the equatorial region\nby the Coriolis force and its width is determined primarily by the flow\nvelocity. Its bottom is separated from the underlying secondary's convection\nzone by a radiative transition layer acting as an insulator. For a typically\nobserved degree of contact the heat capacity of the stream matter is much\nlarger than radiative losses during its flow around the secondary. As a result,\nits effective temperature and entropy decrease very little before it returns to\nthe primary. The existence of the stream changes insignificantly specific\nentropies of both convective envelopes and sizes of the components. Substantial\noversize of the secondaries, required by the Roche geometry, cannot be\nexplained in this way. The situation can, however, be explained by assuming\nthat the primary is a main sequence star whereas the secondary is in an\nadvanced evolutionary stage with hydrogen depleted in its core. Such a\nconfiguration is reached past mass transfer with mass ratio reversal. Good\nagreement with observations is demonstrated by model calculations applied to\nactual W UMa-type binaries. In particular, a presence of the equatorial bulge\nmoving with a relative velocity of 10-30 km/s around both components of AW UMa\nis accounted for.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Feb 2009 11:08:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 May 2009 09:58:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Assuming the perfect fluid\nto be radiation, we solve the coupled equations for the system numerically and\nstudy the evolution of the perturbations from the sub-Hubble to the\nsuper-Hubble scales. In particular, we analyze the effects of the transition\nfrom tachyon driven inflation to the radiation dominated epoch on the evolution\nof the large scale curvature and non-adiabatic pressure perturbations. We\nconsider two different tachyonic potentials and study the effects of two\npossible types of decay of the tachyon into radiation. We plot the spectrum of\ncurvature perturbations at the end of inflation as well as at the early stages\nof the radiation dominated epoch. We find that reheating does not affect the\namplitude of the curvature perturbations in any of these cases. These results\ncorroborate similar conclusions that have been arrived at earlier based on the\nstudy of the evolution of the perturbations in the super-Hubble limit. We\nillustrate that, before the transition to the radiation dominated epoch, the\nrelative non-adiabatic pressure perturbation between the tachyon and radiation\ndecays in a fashion very similar to that of the intrinsic entropy perturbation\nassociated with the tachyon. Moreover, we show that, after the transition, the\nrelative non-adiabatic pressure perturbation dies down extremely rapidly during\nthe early stages of the radiation dominated epoch. These behavior ensure that\nthe amplitude of the curvature perturbations remain unaffected during\nreheating.

Cluster stars have been selected from a\nmembership probability analysis based on a non-parametric method that uses both\npositions and proper motions and does not make any a priori assumption on the\nunderlying distributions.

However, some new results are\nobtained from a more detailed analysis: (a) a clear correlation between Q and\nthe concentration parameter of the King model for those cluster with radial\ndensity profiles, (b) the presence of spatial substructure in clusters as old\nas 100 Myr, and (c) a significant correlation between fractal dimension and age\nfor those clusters with internal substructure.

We analyse a general tree\ngrowth model proposed by Klemm {\\em et. al.} (2005) to explain the growth of\nuser-generated directory structures in computers. The model has a single\nparameter $q$ which interpolates between preferential attachment and random\ngrowth. Our analysis results in three contributions: First, we propose a more\nefficient estimation method for $q$ based on the degree distribution, which is\none specific representation of the model. Next, we introduce the concept of a\nlevel distribution and analytically solve the model for this representation.\nThis allows for an alternative and independent measure of $q$. We argue that,\nto capture real growth processes, the $q$ estimations from the degree and the\nlevel distributions should coincide. Thus, we finally apply both\nrepresentations to validate the model with synthetically generated tree\nstructures, as well as with collected data of user directories. In the case of\nreal directory structures, we show that $q$ measured from the level\ndistribution are incompatible with $q$ measured from the degree distribution.\nIn contrast to this, we find perfect agreement in the case of simulated data.\nThus, we conclude that the model is an incomplete description of the growth of\nreal directory structures as it fails to reproduce the level distribution.

In the\nsemiclassical limit, the method of nonlinear steepest descent, supplemented by\nthe $g$-function mechanism, is applied to this RHP to produce explicit\nasymptotic solution formulae for the integrable system. These formule are based\non a hyperelliptic Riemann surface $\\Rscr=\\Rscr(x,t)$ in the spectral variable,\nwhere the space-time variables $(x,t)$ play the role of external parameters.\nThe curves in the $x,t$ plane, separating regions of different genuses of\n$\\Rscr(x,t)$, are called breaking curves or nonlinear caustics. The genus of\n$\\Rscr(x,t)$ is related to the number of oscillatory phases in the asymptotic\nsolution of the integrable system at the point $x,t$.\n  In this paper we prove that in the case of a regular break, the nonlinear\nsteepest descent asymptotics can be \"automatically\" continued through the\nbreaking curve (however, the expressions for the asymptotic solution will be\ndifferent on the different sides of the curve). Although the results are stated\nand proven for the focusing NLS equation, it is clear that they can be\nreformulated for AKNS systems, as well as for the nonlinear steepest descend\nmethod in a more general setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Feb 2009 15:48:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Their\nexistence is considered to be a challenge for the LCDM cosmology, because\ngalaxy mergers isotropize stellar disks and trigger angular momentum transport\nin gas disks, thus fostering the formation of central stellar spheroids. Here,\nwe postulate that the formation of stellar spheroids from gasrich disks is\ncontrolled by two parameters that characterize galaxy mergers, the mass ratio\nof merging dark matter halos, and the virial velocity of the larger merging\nhalo. We utilize merger histories generated from realizations of the\ncosmological density field to calculate the fraction of dark matter halos that\nhave avoided spheroid formation, and compare the derived statistics with the\nspheroid occupation fractions in surveys of nearby galaxies. We find, for\nexample, that the survival rate of disk-dominated galaxies in LCDM is just high\nenough to explain the observed fractional representation of disk-dominated\ngalaxies in the universe if the only mergers which lead to central spheroid\nformation are those with mass ratios M2/M1 > 0.3 and virial velocities Vvir,1 >\n55 km/s. We discuss the physical origin of this criterion, and show that the\ndependence of the disk-dominated fraction on galaxy mass provides a further\ntest of the merger hypothesis.
