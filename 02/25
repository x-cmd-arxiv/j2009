A natural candidate is the energy at the 'ankle' in the approximately\npower-law energy spectrum which is indicative of a cross-over from a falling\ngalactic component to a flatter extra-galactic component. The transition can\noccur without such flattening but this requires some degree of conspiracy of\nthe spectral shapes and normalizations of the two components. Nevertheless it\nhas been argued that extra-galactic sources of cosmic ray protons which undergo\ninteractions on the CMB can reproduce the energy spectrum below the ankle if\nthe cross-over energy is as low as the 'second knee' in the spectrum. This low\ncross-over model is constrained by direct measurements by the Pierre Auger\nObservatory which indicate a heavier composition at these energies. We\ndemonstrate that upper limits on the cosmic diffuse neutrino flux provide a\ncomplementary constraint on the proton fraction in ultra-high energy\nextra-galactic cosmic rays and forthcoming data from IceCube will provide a\ndefinitive test of this model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Feb 2009 19:03:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2009 20:00:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

It is often easier to calculate\nfixed moments for these quantities compared to a direct attempt to derive them\nin terms of harmonic sums and their generalizations involving the Mellin\nparameter $N$. Starting from a sufficiently large number of given moments, we\nestablish linear recurrence relations of lowest possible order with polynomial\ncoefficients of usually high degree. Then these recurrence equations are solved\nin terms of d'Alembertian solutions where the involved nested sums are\nrepresented in optimal nested depth. Given this representation, it is then an\neasy task to express the result in terms of harmonic sums. In this process we\ncompactify the result such that no algebraic relations occur among the sums\ninvolved. We demonstrate the method for the QCD unpolarized anomalous\ndimensions and massless Wilson coefficients to 3--loop order treating the\ncontributions for individual color coefficients. For the most complicated\nsubproblem 5114 moments were needed in order to produce a recurrence of order\n35 whose coefficients have degrees up to 938. About four months of CPU time\nwere needed to establish and solve the recurrences for the anomalous dimensions\nand Wilson coefficients on a 2 GHz machine requiring less than 10 GB of memory.\nNo algorithm is known yet to provide such a high number of moments for 3--loop\nquantities. Yet the method presented shows that it is possible to establish and\nsolve recurrences of rather large order and and degree, occurring in physics\nproblems, uniquely, fast and reliably with computer algebra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Feb 2009 16:41:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-10"}

A\nGutzwiller wavefunction study of the triangular lattice Heisenberg model with\nappropriate four-spin ring exchanges has found that the projected spinon Fermi\nsea state has a low variational energy. This wavefunction, together with a\nslave particle gauge theory, suggests that such spin liquid possesses spin\ncorrelations that are singular along surfaces in momentum space (\"Bose\nsurfaces\"). Signatures of this state, which we refer to as a \"Spin Bose-Metal\"\n(SBM), are expected to be manifest in quasi-1D ladder systems: The discrete\ntransverse momenta cut through the 2D Bose surface leading to a distinct\npattern of 1D gapless modes. Here we search for a quasi-1D descendant of the\ntriangular lattice SBM state by exploring the Heisenberg plus ring model on a\ntwo-leg strip (zigzag chain). Using DMRG, variational wavefunctions, and a\nBosonization analysis, we map out the full phase diagram. Without ring exchange\nthe model is equivalent to the J_1 - J_2 Heisenberg chain, and we find the\nexpected Bethe-chain and dimerized phases. Remarkably, moderate ring exchange\nreveals a new gapless phase over a large swath of the phase diagram. Spin and\ndimer correlations possess particular singular wavevectors and allow us to\nidentify this phase as the hoped for quasi-1D descendant SBM state. We derive a\nlow energy theory and find three gapless modes and one Luttinger parameter\ncontrolling all power laws. Potential instabilities out of the zigzag SBM give\nrise to other interesting phases such as a period-3 VBS or a period-4 Chirality\norder, which we discover in the DMRG; we also find an interesting SBM state\nwith partial ferromagnetism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Feb 2009 18:15:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

Recently the stack has been subject to criticism for a\nlack of flexibility. However, when it comes right down to it nobody has offered\na truly compelling alternative. Various cross-layer optimizations have been\nproposed, but these optimizations are frequently hacks to achieve a particular\ngoal and offer no direct insight into why the existing network stack is\ninadequate. We propose that a fundamental problem with the existing network\nstack is that it attempts to layer functionality that is not well-suited to\nlayering. In this work we use a \"bottom up\" model of information computation,\nstorage, and transfer and the \"top down\" goals of networking systems to\nformulate a modular decomposition of networking systems. Based on this modular\ndecomposition we propose a semantic layered structure for networking systems\nthat eliminates many awkward cross-layer interactions that arise in the\ncanonical layered stack.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Feb 2009 20:31:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-25"}

Our main motivation is to enable measurements of heavy\nflavor production (charm and beauty) in p+p, p+d and A+A collisions. Such data\nwill illuminate the properties of the matter created in high-energy heavy-ion\ncollisions. The measurements also will reveal the distribution of gluons in\nprotons from p+p collisions. The VTX detector consists of four layers of barrel\ndetectors and covers |eta|< 1.2, and almost a 2pi in azimuth. The inner two\nsilicon barrels consist of silicon pixel sensors; their technology accords with\nthat of the ALICE1LHCB sensor-readout hybrid. The outer two barrels are silicon\nstripixel detectors with a new \"spiral\" design, and a single-sided sensor with\n2-dimensional (X, U) readout. In this paper, we describe the silicon stripixel\ndetector and discuss its performance, including its response to electrons from\na beta source (90Sr), muons from cosmic-rays, and a 120 GeV proton beam. The\nresults from the proton beam demonstrate that the principle of two-dimensional\nposition sensitivity based on charge sharing works; the signal-to-noise value\nis 10.4, the position resolution is 33.6 um for X-stripixel (35.2 um for\nU-stripixel), and the tracking efficiencies in the X- and U-stripixels are,\nover 98.9 +/- 0.2%. The stripixel detector within the VTX project is in the\npre-production phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Feb 2009 20:36:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-30"}

As proxies for the accretion\nrate, we use the H-alpha 10% width and the CaII-8662 line flux.

These planets are of particular\ninterest because they tend to orbit more massive hosts, and have been subjected\nto variable stellar insolation over their recent histories as their primaries\nevolved off the main sequence. Unfortunately, we have limited information about\nthe physical properties of these planets, as they were all detected by the\nradial velocity method and none have been observed to transit. Here we evaluate\nthe prospects for detecting transits of planetary companions to giant stars. We\nshow that several of the known systems have a priori transit probabilities of\n>~ 10%, and about one transiting system is expected for the sample of host\nstars with R >= 2.5 R_sun. Although the transits are expected to have very\nsmall amplitudes (~few x 10^-4) and long durations (>~ 50 hrs), we argue that\nthe difficulty with detecting these signals in broadband light is one of\nsystematic errors and practicality rather than photon noise, even for modest\naperture ~1m telescopes. We propose a novel method that may overcome these\ndifficulties, which uses narrow-band measurements to isolate the thin ring of\nchromospheric emission expected at the limb of giant stars. The transit signals\nin these narrow bands are expected to be larger in magnitude and briefer in\nduration than in broad-band emission, and thus alleviating many of the\ndifficulties with transit detection in broad-band emission. Finally, we point\nout that it may be possible to discover planetary companions to giant stars\nusing Kepler, provided that a sufficient number of such targets are monitored.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Feb 2009 21:01:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2009 18:07:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

These signals are quasi-periodic\noscillations (QPOs), and both the high-frequency variety (HFQPOs, which have\nfrequencies in the 40-450 Hz range) as well as the 0.1-10 Hz low-frequency type\nhave the potential to provide tests of GR in the strong field limit. An\nimportant step on the path to GR tests is to constrain the physical black hole\nproperties, and the straightforward frequency measurements that are possible\nwith X-ray timing may provide one of the cleanest measurements of black hole\nspins. While current X-ray satellites have uncovered these phenomenona, the\nHFQPOs are weak signals, and future X-ray timing missions with larger effective\narea are required for testing the candidate theoretical QPO mechanisms.

The large positive Nernst\nsignal observed in hole-doped high-Tc superconductors above their transition\ntemperature Tc has so far been attributed to fluctuating superconductivity.\nHere we show that in some of these materials the large Nernst signal is in fact\ncaused by stripe order, a form of spin / charge modulation which causes a\nreconstruction of the Fermi surface. In LSCO doped with Nd or Eu, the onset of\nstripe order causes the Nernst signal to go from small and negative to large\nand positive, as revealed either by lowering the hole concentration across the\nquantum critical point in Nd-LSCO, or lowering the temperature across the\nordering temperature in Eu-LSCO. In the latter case, two separate peaks are\nresolved, respectively associated with the onset of stripe order at high\ntemperature and superconductivity near Tc.

For\nthe group showing Br$\\alpha$ and Pf$\\gamma$ lines stronger than Humphreys\nlines, the Humphreys decrement roughly follow the Menzel case-B for optically\nthin conditions. For the group showing comparable Br$\\alpha$, Pf$\\gamma$ and\nHumphreys emission line strengths, the Humphreys decrements moves from an\noptically thin to an optically thick regime at a transition wavelength which is\ncharacteristic for each star, but typically is located around 3.65--3.75 $\\mu$m\n(transitions 6--19 and 6--17). Higher order Humphreys lines probe optically\nthin inner regions even in the optically thicker envelopes. We find evidence of\nlarger broadening in the infrared emission lines compared with optical lines,\nprobably reflecting larger vertical velocity fields near the star. The\nexistence of the aforementioned groups is in principle consistent with the\nproposed description by de Wit et al. (2006) for Be star outbursts in terms of\nthe ejection of an optically thick disk that expands and becomes optically thin\nbefore dissipation into the interstellar medium. Time resolved L-band\nspectroscopy sampling the outburst cycle promises to be an unique tool for\ntesting Be star disk evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Feb 2009 02:37:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Our\nprimary design goals are efficient hardware implementation and low\ncomputational load on the supporting digital processing.

The product is then lowpass filtered\nand sampled uniformly at a low rate, which is orders of magnitude smaller than\nNyquist. Perfect recovery from the proposed samples is achieved under certain\nnecessary and sufficient conditions.

Using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, we show that the\ntransition remains first order down to a thickness of four FCC cells. It\nbecomes clearly second order at a thickness of two FCC cells, i.e. four atomic\nlayers. It is also interesting to note that the presence of the surface reduces\nthe ground state (GS) degeneracy found in the bulk. For the two-cell thickness,\nthe surface magnetization is larger than the interior one. It undergoes a\nsecond-order phase transition at a temperature $T_C$ while interior spins\nbecome disordered at a lower temperature $T_D$. This loss of order is\ncharacterized by a peak of the interior spins susceptibility and a peak of the\nspecific heat which do not depend on the lattice size suggesting that either it\nis not a real transition or it is a Kosterlitz-Thouless nature.

An emphasis\nis on the gauge-invariance of the theory, which turns out to be essential for\nthe physical understanding of the electrodynamics of these compounds. The\ndescription of the optical response involves local (intra-bilayer and\ninter-bilayer) current densities and local conductivities. The local\nconductivities are obtained using a microscopic theory, where the\nquasiparticles of the two bands are coupled to spin fluctuations. The coupling\nleads to superconductivity and is described at the level of generalized\nEliashberg theory. Also addressed is the simpler case of quasiparticles coupled\nby a separable and nonretarded interaction. The gauge invariance of the theory\nis achieved by including a suitable class of vertex corrections. The resulting\nresponse of the model is studied in detail and an interpretation of two\nsuperconductivity-induced peaks in the experimental data of the real part of\nthe c-axis conductivity is proposed. The peak around 400/cm is attributed to a\ncollective mode of the intra-bilayer regions, that is an analogue of the\nBogolyubov-Anderson mode playing a crucial role in the theory of the\nlongitudinal response of superconductors. For small values of the bilayer\nsplitting, its nature is similar to that of the transverse plasmon of the\nphenomenological Josephson superlattice model.

Such behaviour is\ntypical of a classical Be star. For some time this posed a contradiction to our\nunderstanding of the Be phenomena as rapid rotation is thought to be a\nprerequisite for the emission phases of Be stars. Recent work has demonstrated\nthat the Halpha emission is in fact due to a close companion (separation\n~0.25\") of the star. This resolves the apparent enigma if this close companion\nis a classical Be star. We aim to test the hypothesis that this close companion\nis a valid Be star by determining properties such as its spectral type and vsin\ni. We employed spectroastrometry to investigate the close binary system. Using\nthe spectroastrometric signatures observed, we split the composite binary\nspectra into its constituent spectra in the B band and R band. The split\nspectra allow us to estimate spectral types of the binary components. We find\nthat the primary of the close binary system has a spectral type of B2III and\nthe secondary a spectral type of B5Ve. From the relationship between mass and\nspectral type, we determine the masses of the binary components to be M_p =\n12.6+/-3.2 M_* and M_s = 4.4+/-0.7 M_* respectively. The spectroastrometric\ndata allow some constraint on the orbit, and we suggest a moderate revision to\nthe previously determined orbit. We confirm that the primary of the system is a\nslow rotator (vsin i =29 +43/-29 km/s), while the secondary rotates\nsignificantly faster, at a vsin i =230+/-45 km/s. We show that the close\ncompanion to the beta Cep primary is a valid classical Be star.

The key feature of the survey is its coverage of low-mass galaxies\ndown to sigma_0~50km/s. We obtain a best-fitting FP relation log r_e=1.06 log\nsigma_0 - 0.82 log < I >_e + cst in the R band. The shallow exponent of sigma_0\nis a result of the extension of our sample to low velocity dispersions. We\ninvestigate the origin of the intrinsic FP scatter, using estimates of age,\nmetallicity and alpha/Fe. We find that the FP residuals anti-correlate\n(>3sigma) with the mean stellar age in agreement with previous work. However, a\nstronger (>4sigma) correlation with alpha/Fe is also found. These correlations\nindicate that galaxies with effective radii smaller than those predicted by the\nFP have stellar populations systematically older and with alpha over-abundances\nlarger than average, for their sigma_0. Including alpha/Fe as a fourth\nparameter in the FP, the total scatter decreases from 0.088 dex to 0.075 dex\nand the estimated intrinsic scatter decreases from 0.068 dex to 0.049 dex.\nThus, variations in alpha/Fe account for >> 30% of the total variance around\nthe FP, and >> 50% of the estimated intrinsic variance.

Despite the early comprehension of the\nbasic emission mechanism, their spectral energy distribution is generally\ndescribed by phenomenological or simplified models. We propose a study of the\nspectral emission from the high mass X-ray binary pulsar 4U 0115+634 by means\nof thermal and bulk Comptonization models based on the physical properties of\nsuch objects. For this purpose, we analyze the BeppoSAX data in the energy\nrange 0.7-100 keV of the 1999 giant outburst, 12 days after the maximum. We\nmodel the spectral energy distribution of the system using a two-component\ncontinuum. At higher energy, above ~7 keV, the emission is due to thermal and\nbulk Comptonization of the seed photons produced by cyclotron cooling of the\naccretion column, and at lower energy, the emission is due to thermal\nComptonization of a blackbody source in a diffuse halo close to the stellar\nsurface. From the best fit parameters, we argue that the cyclotron emission is\nproduced ~1.7 km above the stellar surface, and escapes from the column near\nits base, where the absorption features are generated by the interaction with\nthe magnetic field in a surrounding halo. We find that in 4U 0115+634, the\nobserved spectrum is dominated by reprocessed cyclotron radiation, whereas in\nother bright sources with stronger magnetic fields such as Her X-1, the\nspectrum is dominated by reprocessed bremsstrahlung.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Feb 2009 15:28:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Under a one-loop renormalization group\nscheme including all allowed interaction processes for not too weak Rashba\ncoupling, we show that electron-electron backscattering is an irrelevant\nperturbation. Therefore no gap arises and electronic transport is described by\na modified Luttinger liquid theory. As an application of the theory, we discuss\nthe RKKY interaction between two magnetic impurities. Interactions are shown to\ninduce a slower power-law decay of the RKKY range function than the usual 1D\nnoninteracting $\\cos(2k_F x)/|x|$ law. Moreover, in the noninteracting Rashba\nwire, the spin-orbit coupling causes a twisted (anisotropic) range function\nwith several different spatial oscillation periods. In the interacting case, we\nshow that one special oscillation period leads to the slowest decay, and\ntherefore dominates the RKKY interaction for large separation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Feb 2009 15:56:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2009 11:41:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-03"}
