In this model, N_D decays dominantly\ninto \\chi e^+e^- through an R parity preserving dimension 6 operator with the\nlife time \\tau_N\\sim 10^{26} sec. We introduce a pair of vector-like superheavy\nSU(2) lepton doublets (L,L^c) and lepton singlets (E,E^c). The dimension 6\noperator leading to the N_D decay is generated from the leptophilic Yukawa\ninteractions by W\\supset Ne^cE+Lh_dE^c+m_{3/2}l_1L^c with the dimensionless\ncouplings of order unity, and the gauge interaction by {\\cal L}\\supset \\sqrt{2}\ng'\\tilde{e}^{c*}e^c\\chi + h.c. The superheavy masses of the vector-like leptons\n(M_L, M_E\\sim 10^{16} GeV) are responsible for the longevity of N_D. The low\nenergy field spectrum in this model is just the MSSM fields and N_D. Even for\nthe case that the portion of N_D is much smaller than that of \\chi in the total\nDM density [{\\cal O}(10^{-10}) \\lesssim n_{N_D}/n_\\chi], the observed positron\nexcess can be explained by adopting relatively lighter masses of the\nvector-like leptons (10^{13} GeV \\lesssim M_{L,E} \\lesssim 10^{16} GeV). The\nsmallness of the electron mass is also explained. This model is easily embedded\nin the flipped SU(5) grand unification, which is a leptophilic unified theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Jan 2009 17:45:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2009 14:40:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 1 Aug 2009 12:26:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-01"}

All seven of the sources show the broad, unidentified 21\nmicron emission feature; three of them are new detections (IRAS 06530-0213,\n07430+1115, and 19477+2401) and the others are observed at higher S/N than in\nprevious spectra. These have the same shape and central wavelength (20.1\nmicrons) as found in the ISO spectra of the brighter PPNs. The 30 micron\nfeature was seen in all seven objects. However, it is not resolved into two\nseparate features (26 and 33 microns) as was claimed on the basis of ISO\nspectra, which presumably suffered from the noisy detector bands in this\nregion. All showed the infrared aromatic bands (AIB) at 11.3, 12.4, and 13.3\nmicrons. Five of these also appear to have the C2H2 molecular band at 13.7\nmicrons, one in absorption and four in emission. This is extremely rare, with\nonly one other evolved star, IRC+10216, in which C2H2 emission has been\nobserved. Four also possessed a broad, unidentified emission feature at 15.8\nmicrons that may possibly be related to the 21 micron feature. Model fits were\nmade to the spectral energy distributions for these PPNs to determine\nproperties of the detached circumstellar envelopes. The 21 micron feature has\nbeen seen in all Galactic carbon-rich PPNs observed, and thus its carrier\nappears to be a common component of the outflow around these objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Jan 2009 16:30:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

It was shown that nuclear magnetism provides an\nadditional binding to the energies of the specific configuration and this\nadditional binding increases with spin and has its {\\it maximum} exactly at the\nterminating state. This suggests that the terminating states can be an\ninteresting probe of the time-odd mean fields {\\it provided that other effects\ncan be reliably isolated.} Unfortunately, a reliable isolation of these effects\nis not that simple: many terms of the density functional theories contribute\ninto the energies of the terminating states and the deficiencies in the\ndescription of those terms affect the result. The recent suggestion\n\\cite{ZSW.05} that the relative energies of the terminating states in the $N\n\\neq Z, A\\sim 44$ mass region given by $\\Delta E$ {\\it provide unique and\nreliable constraints on time-odd mean fields and the strength of spin-orbit\ninteraction} in density functional theories has been reanalyzed. The current\ninvestigation shows that the $\\Delta E$ value is affected also by the relative\nplacement of the states with different orbital angular momentum ${\\it l}$,\nnamely, the placement of the $d$ (${\\it l}=2$) and $f$ (${\\it l}=3$) states.\nThis indicates the dependence of the $\\Delta E$ value on the properties of the\ncentral potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Feb 2009 00:48:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-23"}

By varying the `reality\nmap', which relates the amount wagered to the probability of the outcome, it is\npossible to move continuously from a purely objective game in which\nprobabilities have no dependence on wagers to a purely subjective game in which\nprobabilities equal the amount wagered. We study self-reinforcing games, in\nwhich betting more on an outcome increases its odds, and self-defeating games,\nin which the opposite is true. This is investigated in and out of equilibrium,\nwith and without rational players, and both numerically and analytically.

In case of n-linear\nalgebra of type II we are in a position to define linear functionals which is\none of the marked difference between the n-vector spaces of type I and II.\nHowever all the applications mentioned in n-linear algebras of type I can be\nappropriately extended to n-linear algebras of type II.

We detect narrow HCO+\n(3-2) absorption, and tentatively HCN (3-2), close to the systemic velocity.\nFor both molecules, the J=3-2 absorption is much weaker than for the J=1-0\nline. From simple excitation analysis, we conclude that the gas density is on\nthe order of a few 10^4 cm^-3 for a column density N(HCO+)/dV of 3x10^12 cm^-2\nkm^-1 s and a kinetic temperature of 10 K. In particular, we find no evidence\nfor molecular gas density higher than a few 10^4 cm^-3 on the line of sight to\nthe continuum source. We discuss the implications of our finding on the nature\nof the molecular gas responsible for the absorption toward Cen A.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Feb 2009 10:41:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

As a result one obtains a\nself-consistent theory of the confined region in the (mu,T) plane with\nrealistic hadron properties. At the boundary of the confining region, the\ncolour-electric confining correlator vanishes, and the remaining correlators\ndescribe strong nonperturbative dynamics in the deconfined region with (weakly)\nbound states. Resulting equation of state for mu=0, p(T), (epsilon-3P)/T are in\ngood agreement with lattice data. Phase transition occurs due to evaporation of\na part of the colour-electric gluon condensate, and the resulting critical\ntemperatures T_c(mu) for different n_f are in good correspondence with\navailable data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Feb 2009 13:46:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}
