Understanding the electronic structure\nof the photoisomerization is a prerequisite to understanding how the protein\nsuppresses this pathway and preserves the emitting state of the chromophore. We\npresent a solution to the state-averaged complete active space problem, which\nis spanned at convergence by three fragment-localized orbitals.

We analyze a total of 150 observational spells in 122 days of\ndata spreaded over the entire outburst phase of Feb. 2005 to Oct. 2005. From\nour study, a comprehensive understanding of the detailed behaviour of this\nblack hole candidate has emerged. Based on the degree of importance of the\nblack body and the power-law components we divide the entire episode in four\nspectral states, namely, hard, soft, very soft and intermediate. Quasi-Periodic\noscillations (QPOs) were found in two out of these four states, namely, in the\nhard and the intermediate states. In the hard state, at the rising phase of the\noutburst, QPO frequency ranged from 0.034 - 17.78Hz and the spectra was fitted\nby a disk black body, power-law and iron emission line at 6.2 - 6.5 keV. In the\nintermediate state, QPOs vary from 13.17Hz to 19.04Hz and the QPO frequency\nmodulation in this state was not significant. The spectra in this state are\nwell fitted by the disk black body and the power-law components. In the hard\nstate of the declining phase of the outburst, we found QPOs of decreasing\nfrequency from 13.14 Hz to 0.034 Hz. The spectra of this state were fitted by a\ndisk black body and power-law components, but in the initial few days a cooler\nComptonized component was required for a better fit. In the soft and very soft\nstates, the spectral states are mostly dominated by the strong disk black body\ncomponent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Feb 2009 13:24:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2009 10:26:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-26"}
