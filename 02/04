Different analysis methods have been proposed for this purpose, but so\nfar, no comparative test has been performed to test their validity. We\ncalculated model spectra of disk models with different geometries and central\nsources, using a 2D radiative transfer code. These spectra were then fitted in\na blind test using four different spectral decomposition methods. We studied\nthe effect of disk structure (flared vs. flat), inclination angle, size of the\ninner disk hole and stellar luminosity on the fitted chemical composition. Our\nresults show that the derived dust compositions by all methods deviate\nsystematically from the real chemical composition. Out of the four tested\nspectral decomposition methods, our new two-layer temperature distribution\nmethod, differs the least from the input dust composition and the results show\nthe weakest systematic effects. The reason for the deviations of the results\ngiven by other methods lies in their simplifying assumptions (e.g. single\naverage grain temperature or one component continuum). We also tested the\ninfluence of different noise levels on the results of the spectral\ndecomposition methods. We find that, for ground-based observations (8-13\nmicrometer) the expected uncertainty in the value of the crystallinity is about\n11% for a signal-to-noise ratio of 100, while for space-based observations\n(7-17 micrometer) the uncertainty is about 5%.

We know for\ndecades that it is a priori possible to observe at high fields the\nFulde-Ferrel-Larkin-Ovchinikov (FFLO) state in which the superfluid density\nexhibits a field dependent modulation. The search for such inhomogeneous\ncondensates in materials is the subject of tremendous excitement especially\nafter the discovery of a promising high-field superconducting (HFSC) phase in\nCeCoIn$_5$. However, subsequent neutron and NMR experiments contradicted the\nFFLO picture in CeCoIn$_5$ establishing a puzzling coupling of the distinct\nHFSC state with a magnetic modulation. Here we show that, a novel type of\nexotic state is observed at high fields in CeCoIn$_5$ in which a pattern of\ncoexisting condensates manifests. The specific pattern includes the d-wave\nsinglet SC state, the staggered $\\pi$-triplet SC state and Spin Density Waves\n(SDW). Because of particle-hole asymmetry these three condensates may either\nappear separately or all three together providing a new perspective on\nantiferromagnetic superconductors that may include high-$T_c$ cuprates and\npniktides. The field induced transition to the pattern state in CeCoIn$_5$ is\nonly a paradigm of a generic mechanism that prevents the elimination of the\ndominating condensate by the field via the formation of a pattern of\ncondensates. This opens new avenues for the search of exotic states not only in\nelectronic systems, but also in other systems where inhomogeneous condensates\nare actively discussed like trapped atomic fermi gases and dense quark matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Feb 2009 17:11:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

An important example of such applications are bandwidth estimation\ntools. This area has become a mature research topic with well-developed\nresults. Unfortunately recent studies have shown that the application of these\nresults to WLAN links is not straightforward. The main reasons for this is that\nthe assumptions taken to develop bandwidth measurements tools do not hold any\nlonger in the presence of wireless links (e.g. non-FIFO scheduling). This paper\nbuilds from these observations and its main goal is to analyze the interaction\nbetween probe packets and WLAN transmissions in bandwidth estimation processes.\nThe paper proposes an analytical model that better accounts for the\nparticularities of WLAN links. The model is validated through extensive\nexperimentation and simulation and reveals that (1) the distribution of the\ndelay to transmit probing packets is not the same for the whole probing\nsequence, this biases the measurements process and (2) existing tools and\ntechniques point at the achievable throughput rather than the available\nbandwidth or the capacity, as previously assumed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Feb 2009 17:23:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-04"}

Kink\nwave modes supported by the thread body offer a consistent explanation of these\nobserved oscillations. Among the proposed mechanisms to explain the kink mode\ndamping, resonant absorption in the Alfven continuum seems to be the most\nefficient as it produces damping times of about 3 periods. However, for a\nnonzero-beta plasma and typical prominence conditions, the kink mode is also\nresonantly coupled to slow (or cusp) continuum modes, which could further\nreduce the damping time. In this Letter, we explore for the first time both\nanalytically and numerically the effect of the slow continuum on the damping of\ntransverse thread oscillations. The thread model is composed of a homogeneous\nand straight cylindrical plasma, an inhomogeneous transitional layer, and the\nhomogeneous coronal plasma. We find that the damping of the kink mode due to\nthe slow resonance is much less efficient than that due to the Alfven\nresonance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Feb 2009 18:07:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Mar 2009 10:48:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

These are defined\nas the internal states of a system that lead to the same decision, based on a\nuser-provided utility or pay-off function. The utility function encodes some a\npriori knowledge external to the system, it quantifies how bad it is to make\nmistakes. The intrinsic underlying structure of the system is modeled by an\nepsilon-machine and its causal states. The decisional states form a partition\nof the lower-level causal states that is defined according to the higher-level\nuser's knowledge. In a complex systems perspective, the decisional states are\nthus the \"emerging\" patterns corresponding to the utility function.

As standard ranking criteria of models cannot deal with these\nsystems properly, a new approach is proposed considering the shape of the dwell\ntime histograms. We observed the rotational kinetics of a single F1-ATPase\nalpha3beta3gamma sub-complex over six orders of magnitude of different ATP to\nADP and Pi concentration ratios, and established a general model describing the\nkinetics for the entire range of concentrations. The HMM extension described\nhere is applicable in general to the accurate analysis of protein dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Feb 2009 21:21:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-05"}

While about\nhalf of the extragalactic sources have been optically identified with Active\nGalactic Nuclei (AGN), only a meagre 10% of the galactic sources have a\nreliable identification. This low success rate has mainly to be ascribed to the\nlocal crowding of potential optical counterparts and to the large gamma-ray\nerror boxes (of the order of one degree in radius) which prevented a\nstraightforward optical identification. Indeed, a multi-wavelength\nidentification strategy, based on a systematic coverage of the gamma-ray error\nboxes, has been the only do-able approach.

However,\nthe lack of the detection of a neutron star or pulsar formed in the SN 1987A\nstill remains an unsolved mystery. In this paper we suggest that the newly\nformed neutron star at the center of SN1987A may undergo a phase transition\nafter the neutrino trapping time scale (~10 s). Consequently the compact\nremnant of SN 1987A may be a strange quark star, which has a softer equation of\nstate than that of neutron star matter. Such a phase transition can induce the\nstellar collapse and result in a large amplitude stellar oscillations. We use a\nthree dimensional Newtonian hydrodynamic code to study the time evolution of\nthe temperature and density at the neutrinosphere. Extremely intense pulsating\nneutrino fluxes, with submillisecond period and with neutrino energy (> 30 MeV)\ncan be emitted because the oscillations of the temperature and density are out\nof phase almost 180 degree. If this is true we predict that the current X-ray\nemission from the compact remnant of SN 1987A will be lower than 10^34 erg s-1,\nand it should be a thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum for a bare strange star with\nsurface temperature of around ~10^7 K.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Feb 2009 03:28:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-05"}

Such \"twisted magnetospheres\" are\nthreaded by currents flowing along the closed field lines which can efficiently\ninteract with soft thermal photons via resonant cyclotron scatterings (RCS).\nActually, RCS spectral models proved quite successful in explaining the\npersistent ~1-10 keV emission from the magnetar candidates, the soft gamma-ray\nrepeaters (SGRs) and the anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs). Moreover, it has been\nproposed that, in presence of highly relativistic electrons, the same process\ncan give rise to the observed hard X-ray spectral tails extending up to ~200\nkeV. Spectral calculations have been restricted up to now to the case of a\nglobally twisted dipolar magnetosphere, although there are indications that the\ntwist may be confined only to a portion of the magnetosphere, and/or that the\nlarge scale field is more complex than a simple dipole.
