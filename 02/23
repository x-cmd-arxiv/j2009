We find only\nabout 25% of the haloes to have MAHs that are well described by a 1-parameter\nexponential form. For the rest of the haloes, between 20% (Milky-Way mass) to\n50% (cluster mass) experience late-time growth that is steeper than an\nexponential, whereas the remaining haloes show plateau-ed late-time growth that\nis shallower than an exponential. The haloes with slower late-time growth tend\nto reside in denser environments, suggesting that either tidal stripping or the\n\"hotter\" dynamics are suppressing the accretion rate of dark matter onto these\nhaloes. These deviations from exponential growth are well fit by introducing a\nsecond parameter: M(z) \\propto (1+z)^beta exp(-gamma z). The full distribution\nof beta and gamma as a function of halo mass is provided. From the analytic\nform of M(z), we obtain a simple formula for the mean accretion rate of dark\nmatter, dM/dt, as a function of redshift and mass. At z=0, this rate is 42\nMsun/yr for 1e12 Msun haloes, which corresponds to a mean baryon accretion rate\nof dMbaryon/dt=7 Msun/yr. This mean rate increases approximately as (1+z)^1.5\nat low z and (1+z)^2.5 at high z, reaching dMbaryon/dt = 27, 69, and 140\nMsun/yr at z=1, 2, and 3.

Motivated by the\ngeneral idea of the AdS/CFT correspondence, we consider a simple construction:\nthe Randall-Sundrum 2 (single brane) setup with the Standard Model fields on\nthe brane and a massive vector field in the warped bulk. We show that in this\nmodel the known properties of vector unparticles -- the nontrivial phase of the\nCFT propagator, the necessity and dominance of contact interactions, the\nunitarity constraint on the conformal dimension of the operator, and the tensor\nstructure dictated by conformal symmetry -- follow by simple inspection of the\nbrane-to-brane propagator. The phase has a physical interpretation as\ncontrolling the rate of escape of unparticles into the extra dimension.\nRequiring the correct sign for the imaginary part of the longitudinal\npolarization of the propagator, we obtain the unitarity condition m_5^2 >= 0,\nwhich, unlike in the scalar case, is unchanged from flat space. This condition\nresults in the unitarity bound d_V >= 3, or, more generally, d_V >= D-1 for a\nvector unparticle in D-dimensional space. It is instructive to consider the RS\n2 propagator in (Euclidean) position space: at large distances it behaves as a\npure CFT propagator, while at short distances it turns into the 5d flat space\npropagator. The latter is softer than the former, thus regulating the would-be\ndivergences of the spectral integral and turning the \"contact\" terms seen at\nlow energies into finite-range interactions. Upon Fourier transforming to\nmomentum space, one finds that at low momenta the CFT piece is subdominant to\nthe \"contact\" interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Feb 2009 20:12:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2009 00:05:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-15"}

At low frequencies, the density of states show an excess\ncompared to the Debye squared-frequency law, which has been identified with the\nboson peak. The height of the boson peak increases with polydispersity. The\nvalues of the participation ratio as well as the level spacing statistics\ndemonstrate that the modes comprising the boson peak are largely delocalized.\nInterestingly, the intensity of the boson peak shows a rather narrow\nsensitivity to changes in temperature and is seen to persist even at high\ntemperatures. Study of the difference spectrum at two different polydispersity\nreveals that the increase in the height of boson peak is due to a population\nshift from modes with frequencies above the maximum in the VDOS to that below\nthe maximum, indicating an increase in the fraction of the unstable modes in\nthe system. The latter is further supported by the facilitation of the observed\ndynamics by polydispersity. Since the strength of the liquid increases with\npolydispersity, the present result provides an evidence that the intensity of\nboson peak correlates positively with the strength of the liquid, as observed\nearlier in many experimental systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Feb 2009 17:44:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

In the absence of\nan active SMBH and recent star formation, the most likely heating source for\nthe hot gas is Type Ia SNe. The presence of cooler, dusty gas residing in a\nnuclear spiral has long been known in terms of optical line emission and\nextinction. We further reveal the infrared emission of the nuclear spiral and\nevaluate the relative importance of various possible ionizing sources. We show\nevidence for interaction between the nuclear spiral and the hot gas, probably\nvia thermal evaporation. This mechanism lends natural understandings to 1) the\ninactivity of M31*, in spite of a probably continuous supply of gas from outer\ndisk regions, and 2) the launch of a bulge outflow of hot gas, primarily\nmass-loaded from the circumnuclear regions. One particular prediction of such a\nscenario is the presence of gas with intermediate temperatures arising from the\nconductive interfaces. The FUSE observations do show strong OVI$\\lambda$1032\nand 1038 absorption lines against the bulge starlight, but the effective OVI\ncolumn density (~4x10^{14} cm^{-2}), may be attributed to foreground gas\nlocated in the bulge and/or the highly inclined disk of M31.

For systems\nseveral Mpc across like the Local Group, we introduce three self-consistent\nindependent mass estimators.

The first is a\nmodified Kahn-Woltjer model which gives a value of the Local Group mass via the\nparticular motions of the two largest members, the Milky Way and M31. Inclusion\nof dark energy in this model increases the minimum mass estimate by a factor of\nthree compared to the \"classical estimate\". The increase is less but still\nsignificant for different ways of using the timing argument.

They are among the densest star clusters\nin the Universe. The NSC in the Milky Way is the only object of this class that\ncan be resolved into individual stars. We measured the proper motions of more\nthan 6000 stars within ~1.0 pc of the supermassive black hole Sgr A*. The full\ndata set is provided in this work. We largely exclude the known early-type\nstars with their peculiar dynamical properties from the dynamical analysis. The\ncluster is found to rotate parallel to Galactic rotation, while the velocity\ndispersion appears isotropic (or anisotropy may be masked by the cluster\nrotation). The Keplerian fall-off of the velocity dispersion due to the point\nmass of Sgr A* is clearly detectable only at R <~ 0.3 pc. Nonparametric\nisotropic and anisotropic Jeans models are applied to the data. They imply a\nbest-fit black hole mass of 3.6 (+0.2/-0.4) x 10^6 solar masses. Although this\nvalue is slightly lower than the current canonical value of 4.0x10^6 solar\nmasses, this is the first time that a proper motion analysis provides a mass\nfor Sagittarius A* that is consistent with the mass inferred from orbits of\nindividual stars. The point mass of Sagittarius A* is not sufficient to explain\nthe velocity data. In addition to the black hole, the models require the\npresence of an extended mass of 0.5-1.5x10^6 solar masses in the central\nparsec. This is the first time that the extended mass of the nuclear star\ncluster is unambiguously detected. The influence of the extended mass on the\ngravitational potential becomes notable at distances >~0.4 pc from Sgr A*.\nConstraints on the distribution of this extended mass are weak. The extended\nmass can be explained well by the mass of the stars that make up the cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Feb 2009 11:28:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

In many ecosystems, SAR curves display a\npower-law dependence, $S\\propto A^z$. The exponent $z$ is always less than one\nbut shows significant variation in different ecosystems. We study the multitype\nvoter model as one of the simplest models able to reproduce SAR similar to\nthose observed in real ecosystems in terms of basic ecological processes such\nas birth, dispersal and speciation. Within the model, the species-area exponent\n$z$ depends on the dimensionless speciation rate $\\nu$, even though the\ndetailed dependence is still matter of controversy. We present extensive\nnumerical simulations in a broad range of speciation rates from $\\nu =10^{-3}$\ndown to $\\nu = 10^{-11}$, where the model reproduces values of the exponent\nobserved in nature. In particular, we show that the inverse of the species-area\nexponent linearly depends on the logarithm of $\\nu$. Further, we compare the\nmodel outcomes with field data collected from previous studies, for which we\nseparate the effect of the speciation rate from that of the different species\nlifespans. We find a good linear relationship between inverse exponents and\nlogarithm of species lifespans.

To begin this\nprocess, oscillation frequencies must be extracted from the observational data,\ntypically time series of the star's brightness or radial velocity. In this\npaper, a probabilistic model is introduced for inferring the frequencies and\namplitudes of stellar oscillation modes from data, assuming that there is some\nperiodic character to the oscillations, but that they may not be exactly\nsinusoidal. Effectively we fit damped oscillations to the time series, and\nhence the mode lifetime is also recovered. While this approach is\ncomputationally demanding for large time series (> 1500 points), it should at\nleast allow improved analysis of observations of solar-like oscillations in\nsubgiant and red giant stars, as well as sparse observations of semiregular\nstars, where the number of points in the time series is often low. The method\nis demonstrated on simulated data and then applied to radial velocity\nmeasurements of the red giant star xi Hydrae, yielding a mode lifetime between\n0.41 and 2.65 days with 95% posterior probability. The large frequency\nseparation between modes is ambiguous, however we argue that the most plausible\nvalue is 6.3 microHz, based on the radial velocity data and the star's position\nin the HR diagram.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Feb 2009 13:36:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Combining positions, distances,\nproper motions, and radial velocities yields complete 3-dimensional kinematic\ninformation. We find that star forming regions on average are orbiting the\nGalaxy ~15 km/s slower than expected for circular orbits. By fitting the\nmeasurements to a model of the Galaxy, we estimate the distance to the Galactic\ncenter R_o = 8.4 +/- 0.6 kpc and a circular rotation speed Theta_o = 254 +/- 16\nkm/s. The ratio Theta_o/R_o can be determined to higher accuracy than either\nparameter individually, and we find it to be 30.3 +/- 0.9 km/s/kpc, in good\nagreement with the angular rotation rate determined from the proper motion of\nSgr A*. The data favor a rotation curve for the Galaxy that is nearly flat or\nslightly rising with Galactocentric distance. Kinematic distances are generally\ntoo large, sometimes by factors greater than two; they can be brought into\nbetter agreement with the trigonometric parallaxes by increasing Theta_o/R_o\nfrom the IAU recommended value of 25.9 km/s/kpc to a value near 30 km/s/kpc. We\noffer a \"revised\" prescription for calculating kinematic distances and their\nuncertainties, as well as a new approach for defining Galactic coordinates.\nFinally, our estimates of Theta_o and To/R_o, when coupled with direct\nestimates of R_o, provide evidence that the rotation curve of the Milky Way is\nsimilar to that of the Andromeda galaxy, suggesting that the dark matter halos\nof these two dominant Local Group galaxy are comparably massive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Feb 2009 14:01:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 May 2009 19:15:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-05"}

In this system the restriction of the long--ranged interface\nfluctuations by particles gives rise to fluctuation--induced forces which are\nequivalent to interactions of Casimir type and which are anisotropic in the\ninterface plane. Since the position and the orientation of the colloids with\nrespect to the interface normal may also fluctuate, this system is an example\nfor the Casimir effect with fluctuating boundary conditions. In the approach\ntaken here, the Casimir interaction is rewritten as the interaction between\nfluctuating multipole moments of an auxiliary charge density--like field\ndefined on the area enclosed by the contact lines. These fluctuations are\ncoupled to fluctuations of multipole moments of the contact line position (due\nto the possible position and orientational fluctuations of the colloids). We\nobtain explicit expressions for the behavior of the Casimir interaction at\nlarge distances for arbitrary ellipsoid aspect ratios. If colloid fluctuations\nare suppressed, the Casimir interaction at large distances is isotropic,\nattractive and long ranged (double--logarithmic in the distance). If, however,\ncolloid fluctuations are included, the Casimir interaction at large distances\nchanges to a power law in the inverse distance and becomes anisotropic. The\nleading power is 4 if only vertical fluctuations of the colloid center are\nallowed, and it becomes 8 if also orientational fluctuations are included.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Feb 2009 15:27:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2009 09:42:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-30"}

These equations provide mean field dynamics\nfor the firing rate or activity of neurons within a network given some\nconnectivity. The shortcoming of these equations is that they take into account\nonly the average firing rate while leaving out higher order statistics like\ncorrelations between firing. A stochastic theory of neural networks which\nincludes statistics at all orders was recently formulated. We describe how this\ntheory yields a systematic extension to population rate equations by\nintroducing equations for correlations and appropriate coupling terms. Each\nlevel of the approximation yields closed equations, i.e. they depend only upon\nthe mean and specific correlations of interest, without an {\\it ad hoc}\ncriterion for doing so.

In case of one magnetic pole, which is free to move in the domain,\nthe nodal lines may cluster dissecting the domain in three parts. Our main\nresult states that the magnetic energy is critical (with respect to the\nmagnetic pole) if and only if such a configuration occurs. Moreover the nodal\nregions form a minimal 3-partition of the domain (with respect to the real\nenergy associated to the equation), the configuration is unique and depends\ncontinuously on the data.
