In\nthis paper we consider the characterization and recognition problems of graphs\nthat are squares of graphs of small girth, i.e. to determine if G = H2 for some\ngraph H of small girth. The main results are the following. - There is a graph\ntheoretical characterization for graphs that are squares of some graph of girth\nat least 7. A corollary is that if a graph G has a square root H of girth at\nleast 7 then H is unique up to isomorphism. - There is a polynomial time\nalgorithm to recognize if G = H2 for some graph H of girth at least 6. - It is\nNP-complete to recognize if G = H2 for some graph H of girth 4. These results\nalmost provide a dichotomy theorem for the complexity of the recognition\nproblem in terms of girth of the square roots. The algorithmic and graph\ntheoretical results generalize previous results on tree square roots, and\nprovide polynomial time algorithms to compute a graph square root of small\ngirth if it exists. Some open questions and conjectures will also be discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Feb 2009 16:20:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-13"}

While optimal complementation techniques for finite\nautomata are simple - it suffices to determinize them using a simple subset\nconstruction and to dualize the acceptance condition of the resulting automaton\n- B\\\"uchi complementation is more involved. Indeed, the construction of an\nEXPTIME complementation procedure took a quarter of a century from the\nintroduction of B\\\"uchi automata in the early 60s, and stepwise narrowing the\ngap between the upper and lower bound to a simple exponent (of (6e)n for\nB\\\"uchi automata with n states) took four decades. While the distance between\nthe known upper (O'(0.96 n)n') and lower ('(0.76 n)n') bound on the required\nnumber of states has meanwhile been significantly reduced, an exponential\nfactor remains between them. Also, the upper bound on the size of the\ncomplement automaton is not linear in the bound of its state space. These gaps\nare unsatisfactory from a theoretical point of view, but also because B\\\"uchi\ncomplementation is a useful tool in formal verification, in particular for the\nlanguage containment problem. This paper proposes a B\\\"uchi complementation\nalgorithm whose complexity meets, modulo a quadratic (O(n2)) factor, the known\nlower bound for B\\\"uchi complementation. It thus improves over previous\nconstructions by an exponential factor and concludes the quest for optimal\nB\\\"uchi complementation algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Feb 2009 16:26:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-02"}

In particular, attempts to reconcile experimental\nobservations and theoretical predictions for the spontaneous supercurrents\nexpected at sample edges and domain walls of a chiral p-wave superconductor and\nfor the polar Kerr effect, a key signature of broken time-reversal symmetry,\nare discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Feb 2009 17:03:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

A set of cF-type absorption lines were\nalso analyzed for a possible connection with the hot component motion. A new\nperiod of 453.6 days and a mass ratio, q=M_g/M_h=0.59 were determined. Assuming\na massive white dwarf as the hot component, M_h= 1.2-1.4 M_{\\odot}, the red\ngiant mass is M_g= 0.68-0.80 M_{\\odot} and the orbit inclination, i =\n49-52^{\\circ}.

Initially\nbright only in the UV, V458 Vul became a variable hard X-ray source due to\noptically thin thermal emission at kT=0.64 keV with an X-ray band unabsorbed\nluminosity of 2.3x10^{34} erg s^{-1} during days 71-140. The X-ray spectrum at\nthis time requires a low Fe abundance (0.2^{+0.3}_{-0.1} solar), consistent\nwith a Suzaku measurement around the same time. On day 315 we find a new X-ray\nspectral component which can be described by a blackbody with temperature of\nkT=23^{+9}_{-5} eV, while the previous hard X-ray component has declined by a\nfactor of 3.8. The spectrum of this soft X-ray component resembles those\ntypically seen in the class of supersoft sources (SSS) which suggests that the\nnova ejecta were starting to clear and/or that the WD photosphere is shrinking\nto the point at which its thermal emission reaches into the X-ray band. We find\na high degree of variability in the soft component with a flare rising by an\norder of magnitude in count rate in 0.2 days. In the following observations on\ndays 342.4-383.6, the soft component was not seen, only to emerge again on day\n397. The hard component continued to evolve, and we found an anticorrelation\nbetween the hard X-ray emission and the UV emission, yielding a Spearman rank\nprobability of 97%. After day 397, the hard component was still present, was\nvariable, and continued to fade at an extremely slow rate but could not be\nanalysed owing to pile up contamination from the bright SSS component.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Feb 2009 20:11:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

All-electron ab initio\ncalculations are used to study the chromophore-nanotube hybrids, and show that\nthe chromophores bind strongly to the nanotubes without disturbing the\nelectronic structure of either species. Calculated values of the dipole moments\nsupport the notion of dipole changes as the optical detection mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Feb 2009 23:03:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-30"}

The amount of rotational shear required for the\ninstability is estimated in dependence of the character of radial\nstratification and the flow patterns excited by the instability are found. The\neigenvalue equations for the nonaxisymmetric disturbances are formulated in 3D\nand then solved numerically. Radial displacements and entropy disturbances are\nincluded.

The critical magnitude of the latitudinal\ndifferential rotation for onset of the instability is considerably reduced in\nthe 3D theory compared to the 2D approximation.

We see dramatic brightening on days 4 to 7 at 6 GHz and an\naccompanying increase in other bands, particularly 1.46 GHz, consistent with\ntransition from the initial \"free expansion\" phase to the adiabatic expansion\nphase. This is complete by day 13 when the flux density at 5 GHz is apparently\ndeclining from an unexpectedly early maximum (compared with expectations from\nobservations of the 1985 outburst). The flux density recovered to a second peak\nby approximately day 40, consistent with behaviour observed in 1985. At all\ntimes the spectral index is consistent with mixed non-thermal and thermal\nemission. The spectral indices are consistent with a non-thermal component at\nlower frequencies on all dates, and the spectral index changes show that the\ntwo components are clearly variable. The estimated extent of the emission at 22\nGHz on day 59 is consistent with the extended east and west features seen at\n1.7 GHz with the VLBA on day 63 being entirely non-thermal.

Since the resulting gamma-ray emissivity\ndepends on the target density, the detection of rapid variability in\nmicroquasars with GLAST and the new generation of Cherenkov imaging arrays\ncould be used to probe the clumped structure of the stellar wind.

We thus aim at giving a better description of\ndynamics in the mesoscale range which lies between the two scales mentioned\nabove. Method: We analyse a 48h high-resolution time sequence of the quiet Sun\nphotosphere at the disk center obtained with the Solar Optical Telescope\nonboard Hinode. The observations, which have a field of view of 100\n\\arcsec$\\times$ 100 \\arcsec, typically contain four supergranules. We monitor\nin detail the motion and evolution of granules as well as those of the radial\nmagnetic field. Results: This analysis allows us to better characterize Trees\nof Fragmenting Granules issued from repeated fragmentation of granules,\nespecially their lifetime statistics. Using floating corks advected by measured\nvelocity fields, we show their crucial role in the advection of the magnetic\nfield and in the build up of the network.

Our estimate for\nthe magnetic diffusion associated with this horizontal motion might provide a\nuseful input for mean-field dynamo models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Feb 2009 12:45:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-16"}

We estimate photometric\ndistances to all stars, accurate to ~ 20 %, and combine them with the proper\nmotions to derive tangential velocities for this kinematically unbiased sample\nof stars. Based on a statistical de-projection method we then derive the\nvertical profiles (to heights of Z = 800 pc above the disk plane) for the first\nand second moments of the three dimensional stellar velocity distribution. We\nfind that <W> = -7 +/- 1 km/s and <U> = -9 +/- 1 km/s, independent of height\nabove the mid-plane, reflecting the Sun's motion with respect to the local\nstandard of rest. In contrast, <V> changes distinctly from -20 +/- 2 km/s in\nthe mid-plane to <V> = -32 km/s at Z = 800 pc, reflecting an asymmetric drift\nof the stellar mean velocity that increases with height. All three components\nof the M-star velocity dispersion show a strong linear rise away from the\nmid-plane, most notably \\sigma_{ZZ}, which grows from 18 km/s (Z = 0) to 40\nkm/s (at Z = 800 pc). We determine the orientation of the velocity ellipsoid,\nand find a significant vertex deviation of 20 to 25 degrees, which decreases\nonly slightly to heights of Z = 800 pc. Away from the mid-plane, our sample\nexhibits a remarkably large tilt of the velocity ellipsoid towards the Galactic\nplane, which reaches 20 deg. at Z = 800 pc and which is not easily explained.\nFinally, we determine the ratio \\sigma^2_{\\phi\\phi}/\\sigma^2_{RR} near the\nmid-plane, which in the epicyclic approximation implies an almost perfectly\nflat rotation curve at the Solar radius.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Feb 2009 15:23:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
