The known relic abundance of DM can be used to fix the ratio\nof the dark sector coupling to the dark matter mass. Finally, the recent\nobservation of cosmic ray positron and electron excesses can be used to fix the\nmass of the dark matter through the observation of a shoulder in the spectrum\nand the size of the kinetic mixing by fitting to the rate.

We estimated the local phospholipid composition, and\ncalculated the change in elastic free energy of the membrane caused by nascent\nLD. Based on this model calculation, we found a gradual demixing of lipids in\nthe membrane leaflet that goes along with an increase in surface curvature at\nthe site of LD formation. During demixing, the phospholipid monolayer was able\nto gain energy during LD growth, which suggested that the formation of curved\ninterfaces was supported by or even driven by lipid demixing. In addition, we\nshow that demixing is thermodynamically necessary as LD cannot bud-off\notherwise.\n  In the case of Saccharomyces cerevisiae our model predicts a LD bud-off\ndiameter of about 13 nm.

I analysed in detail the many and different\nobservational evidences of a discrepancy the predicted halo equilibrium state\nand the one inferred from the measurable properties of disk galaxies, as well\nas of the scaling relations existing between the angular momentum, geometry and\nmass distribution of the luminous and dark components, and realized that they\nall seem to point towards the same conclusion: the baryons hosted inside the\nhalo, by collapsing and assembling to form the galaxy, perturb the halo\nequilibrium structure and made it evolve into new configurations. From the\ntheoretical point of view, the behaviour of dark matter halos as collisionless\nsystems of particles makes their equilibrium structure and mass distribution\nextremely sensitive to perturbations of their inner dynamics. The galaxy\nformation occurring inside the halos is a tremendous event, and the dynamical\ncoupling between the baryons and the dark matter during the protogalaxy\ncollapse represents a perturbation of the halo dynamical structure large enough\nto trigger a halo evolution, according to the relative mass and angular\nmomentum of the two components. My conclusion is that the structure and\ndynamics of dark matter halos, as well as the origin of the connection between\nthe halo and galaxy properties, are to be understood in in terms of a joint\nevolution of the baryonic and dark components, originating at the epoch of the\ncollapse and formation of the galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Feb 2009 18:52:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-20"}

The expansion is then employed to calculate the momentum\ndistribution of the bosons in the Mott phase for an infinite homogeneous\nperiodic system at zero temperature through third-order in the hopping. By\nusing scaling theory for the critical behavior at zero momentum and at the\ncritical value of the hopping for the Mott insulator to superfluid transition\nalong with a generalization of the RPA-like form for the momentum distribution,\nwe are able to extrapolate the series to infinite order and produce very\naccurate quantitative results for the momentum distribution in a simple\nfunctional form for one, two, and three dimensions; the accuracy is better in\nhigher dimensions and is on the order of a few percent relative error\neverywhere except close to the critical value of the hopping divided by the\non-site repulsion.

The strong-coupling expansions and scaling\ntheory results are benchmarked against numerically exact QMC simulations in two\nand three dimensions and against DMRG calculations in one dimension.

These cool, faint and low mass stars make up more than 80% of all\nstars. Also dM stars have extremely long life times (longer than 50-100 Gyr).\nDetermining the number of red dwarfs with planets and assessing planetary\nhabitability (a planet's potential to develop and sustain life) is critically\nimportant because such studies would indicate how common life is in the\nuniverse. Our program - \"Living with a Red Dwarf\" - addresses these questions\nby investigating the long-term nuclear evolution and the coronal and\nchromospheric properties of red dwarf stars with widely different ages (~50 Myr\n-- 12 Gyr). One major focus of the program is to study the magnetic-dynamo\ngenerated coronal and chromospheric X-ray--FUV/UV emissions and flare\nproperties of a sample of dM0--5 stars. Observations carried out by FUSE of a\nnumber of young to old dM stars provide important data for understanding\ntransition region heating in these stars with deep convective zones as well as\nproviding measures of FUV irradiances. Also studied are the effects of\nX-ray--FUV emissions on possible hosted planets and impacts of this radiation\non their habitability. Using these data we are constructing irradiance tables\n(X-UV irradiances) that can be used to model the effects of XUV radiation on\nplanetary atmospheres and possible life on planetary surfaces.

The observed red sequence shows a tilt towards bluer colors and a\ndecrease in scatter at the bright end. These characteristics are predicted by\nour model, based on merger trees from a semi-analytic model of galaxy\nformation. We assume galaxies move onto a \"creation red sequence\" when they\nundergo major gas-rich mergers. Subsequent dry mergers move galaxies along the\nrelation by increasing their mass, but also make them slightly bluer. This\noccurs because bright galaxies are most likely to merge with one of the more\nnumerous fainter and consequently bluer galaxies that lie further down the\nrelation. Bright galaxies undergo a higher fraction of dry mergers than faint\ngalaxies, which causes a change in the slope of the CMR. A more realistic model\nthat includes scatter in the initial relation shows that dry merging causes a\ntightening of the CMR towards the bright end. The small scatter in the observed\nCMR thus cannot be used to argue against significant mass growth from dry\nmerging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Feb 2009 21:22:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-23"}

We propose a model in which the\ndecision of a buyer to buy the product is influenced by friends that own the\nproduct and the price at which the product is offered. The influence model we\nanalyze is quite general, naturally extending both the Linear Threshold model\nand the Independent Cascade model, while also incorporating price information.\nWe consider sales proceeding in a cascading manner through the network, i.e. a\nbuyer is offered the product via recommendations from its neighbors who own the\nproduct. In this setting, the seller influences events by offering a cashback\nto recommenders and by setting prices (via coupons or discounts) for each buyer\nin the social network.\n  Finding a seller strategy which maximizes the expected revenue in this\nsetting turns out to be NP-hard. However, we propose a seller strategy that\ngenerates revenue guaranteed to be within a constant factor of the optimal\nstrategy in a wide variety of models. The strategy is based on an\ninfluence-and-exploit idea, and it consists of finding the right trade-off at\neach time step between: generating revenue from the current user versus\noffering the product for free and using the influence generated from this sale\nlater in the process. We also show how local search can be used to improve the\nperformance of this technique in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Feb 2009 00:06:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-23"}

This fledgling enterprise motivates the following decadal goals:\n(1) Firmly establish the continuum-fitting and Fe K methods; obtain precise\nvalues of spin for 10-20 black holes, several using both methods; (2) use the\nderived masses and spins to test models of jets, GRBs, supernovae, black hole\nformation, black hole binary evolution, etc.; (3) serve the IXO mission by\nsecuring the Fe K methodology, which is currently the only means to measure the\nspins of supermassive black holes in AGN; (4) identify the correct model of\nhigh-frequency QPOs, thereby opening a third channel for measuring spin; (5)\npursue X-ray polarimetry as a means of securing the continuum-fitting and Fe K\nmethods, and also as a possible fourth avenue to spin; and (6) develop and test\nMHD models of thin disks in strong gravity.

This new result enables us to\ncalculate the details of the self-consistent ion cores, as well as the\nionization potentials for the first s-orbital bound to the closed-shell ion\ncore of the Group III, IV and V elements. Next, we demonstrate a method for\nseparating core electron densities from valence electron densities. When we\ncalculate the valence kinetic energy density, we show that it separates into\ntwo terms: the first exactly cancels the potential energy of the ion core in\nthe core region; the second represents the residual kinetic energy density\nresulting from the valence density alone. Furthermore, we show that the kinetic\ncancellation and the residual kinetic energy can be derived from a slowly\nvarying envelope approximation for the valence orbitals in the core region.\nThis kinetic cancellation in the core region and the residual valence kinetic\nenergy term allow us to write a functional for the total valence energy\ndependant only on a low spatial frequency valence density. In the limit, when\nwe can freeze the potential of the closed-shell ion cores, assuming that they\nare not greatly influenced by the readjustment of the valence electrons, we can\nminimize the total valence energy with respect to the valence density degrees\nof freedom. The variation of the valence total energy equation provides the\nstarting point for a large number of atomic, molecular and solid-state\nelectronic structure problems. Here, we use it to calculate the band structures\nresulting from the self-consistent valence density and potential on the\nzinc-blende and diamond lattices. We give band structure results for most of\nthe Group III-V, as well as Group IV, materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Feb 2009 14:34:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-23"}

No statistical difference is found in their prompt\ngamma-rays, and the X-ray properties of the two samples are also similar,\nalthough the SPL sample tend to have a slightly lower NH value of the host\ngalaxies and larger energy release compared with the canonical sample. The SPL\nXRT lightcurves in the burst frame gradually merge into a conflux.The normal\ndecay segment for the canonical sample has the same feature. Similar to the\nnormal decay segment, the SPL lightcurves satisfy the closure relations of\nexternal shock models. If the X-rays are the afterglow of the GRB fireball, our\nresults indicate that the shallow decay would be due to energy injection and\nthe total energy budget after injection for both samples of GRBs is comparable.\nMore intriguing, we find that a prior X-ray emission model proposed by Yamazaki\nis more straightforward to interpret the data. We show that the zero times (T0)\nof the X-rays atisfy a log-normal distribution, and the negligible T0's of the\nSPL sample are consistent with being the tail of T0 distributions at low end.\nReferenced to T0, the canonical XRT lightcurves well trace the SPL lightcurves.\nThe T0's of the canonical lightcurves in our analysis are usually much larger\nthan the offsets of the known precursors from the main GRBs, indicating the\nX-rays would be an emission component from external shocks prior to GRB\ntrigger.

The communication protocol is defined such that readings\ntravel in packets. The packets have a capacity of $k$ bytes.

Based on this new information we have obtained an\nestimate of the masses of the binary components; 3M_{sun} and 2.5M_{sun} for\nthe north and south components, respectively. We have estimated the age of the\nsystem to be ~2-3 Myr. We detect both components of the binary in the zeroth\norder Chandra image and in the grating spectra. Our fits to the spectrum of the\nbinary have shown that the emission is dominated by a plasma between 8 and 15\nMK, a soft component at 4 MK and a hard component at 50 MK are also detected.\nThe value of the hydrogen column density was low, 8 x 10^{19} cm^{-2}, likely\ndue to the clearing of the inner region of the Lambda Orionis cloud.

A 3-T model was fitted\nto the individual zeroth order spectra using the abundances derived for the\nbinary.

The\nresponse curve obtained for different values of $t_w$ are usually collapsed\nusing values of $\\mu$ slightly below one, a scaling behavior generally known as\n\\emph{sub-aging}. Recent spin glass Thermoremanent Magnetization experiments\nhave shown that the value of $\\mu$ is strongly affected by the form of the\ninitial cooling protocol (Rodriguez et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 91, 037203, 2003),\nand even more importantly, (Kenning et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 057201, 2006)\nthat the $t_{\\rm w}$ dependence of the response curves vanishes altogether in\nthe limit $t_{\\rm obs} \\gg t_{\\rm w}$. The latter result shows that the widely\nused $t_{\\rm obs}/t_{\\rm w}^\\mu$ scaling of linear response data cannot be\ngenerally valid, and casts some doubt on the theoretical significance of the\nexponent $\\mu$. In this work, a common mechanism is proposed for the origin of\nboth sub-aging and end of aging behavior in glassy dynamics. The mechanism\ncombines real and configuration space properties of the state produced by the\ninitial thermal quench which initiates the aging process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Feb 2009 11:14:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 10 Oct 2009 16:08:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-10"}

This provides a powerful tool to study\nblack holes in a hydrodynamic setup. We study the stability of plasma balls,\nholographic duals of Scherck-Schwarz (SS) AdS black holes. We find that\nrotating plasma balls are unstable against m-lobed perturbations for rotation\nrates higher than a critical value. This unstable mode signals a bifurcation to\na new branch of non-axisymmetric stationary solutions which resemble a\n\"peanut-like\" rotating plasma. The gravitational dual of the rotating plasma\nball must then be unstable and possibly decay to a non-axisymmetric long-lived\nSS AdS black hole. This instability provides therefore a mechanism that bounds\nthe rotation of SS black holes. Our results are strictly valid for the SS AdS\ngravity theory dual to a SS gauge theory. The latter is particularly important\nbecause it shares common features with QCD, namely it is non-conformal,\nnon-supersymmetric and has a confinement/deconfinement phase transition.

Examining how external galaxies or groups would\ngravitationally affect (and eventually alter) the planar structure (and its\ntemporal evolution) of the LG, they found that the external force field acts\nparallel to the plane determined by geometry and studied this with the Least\nAction Principle. In this paper, we have thoroughly investigated the role\nplayed by the tidal forces exerted by external galaxies or galaxy groups on the\nLG galaxies (the most distant dwarfs in particular) in shaping their large\nscale distribution. The idea based on the well known effect of tidal\ninteractions, according to which a system of mass-points can undergo not only\ntidal stripping but also tidal compression and thus become flatter. Excluding\nthe dwarf galaxies tightly bound to the MW and M31, the same tidal forces can\naccount for the planar distribution of the remaining dwarf galaxies.

The replica method allows us to use the ties between the optimal\nreceiver mutual information and the MMSE SIR of Gaussian inputs to calculate\nthe joint moments of the SIRs of the MMSE subchannels. Using the methodology\ndiscussed in arXiv:0810.0883 it can be shown that the mutual information\nconverges in distribution to a Gaussian random variable. Our results agree very\nwell with simulations even with a moderate number of antennas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Feb 2009 14:51:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

This\narticle studies its relationship with the theory of quaternionic holomorphic\n2-tori in HP^1 (which are equivalent to conformally immersed 2-tori in S^4).\nAfter describing how the Sato-Segal-Wilson construction of KP solutions\n(particularly solutions of finite type) carries over to this quaternionic\nsetting, we compare three different notions of \"spectral curve\": the QKP\nspectral curve, which arises from an algebra of commuting differential\noperators; the (unnormalised) Floquet multiplier spectral curve for the related\nDirac operator; and the curve parameterising Darboux transforms of a conformal\n2-torus in S^4 (in the sense of Bohle, Leschke, Pedit and Pinkall). The latter\ntwo are shown to be images of the QKP spectral curve, which need not be smooth.\nMoreover, it is a singularisation of this QKP spectral curve, rather than the\nnormalised Floquet multiplier curve, which determines the classification of\nconformally immersed 2-tori of finite spectral genus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Feb 2009 15:11:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Feb 2009 10:55:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 12 Jan 2011 16:28:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-16"}
