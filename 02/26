The\nmeasurement is based on correlating the brightness of ~85,000 quasars at z>1\nwith the position of 20 million galaxies at z~0.3 derived from the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey and is used to constrain the galaxy-mass and galaxy-dust\ncorrelation functions up to cosmological scales.\n  The presence of dust is detected from 20 kpc to several Mpc, and we find its\nprojected density to follow: Sigma_dust ~ theta^-0.8, a distribution similar to\nmass. The amount of dust in galactic halos is found to be comparable to that in\ndisks. On large scales its wavelength dependence is described by R_V=3.9+/-2.6,\nconsistent with interstellar dust. We estimate the resulting opacity of the\nUniverse as a function of redshift and find A_V~0.03 mag up to z=0.5. This, in\nturn, implies a cosmic dust density of Omega_dust ~ 5x10^-6, roughly half of\nwhich comes from dust in halos of ~L* galaxies.\n  We present magnification measurements, corrected for dust extinction, from\nwhich the galaxy-mass correlation function is inferred. The mean mass profile\naround galaxies is found to be Sigma ~ 30 (theta/arcmin)^-0.8 h M_sun/pc^2 up\nto a radius of 10 Mpc, in agreement with gravitational shear estimates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Feb 2009 20:43:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Photometry sets a limit to the effective\nradius of the nucleus at r_e < 0.7 km (red geometric albedo 0.05 assumed). The\ncoma shows a secular fading in our data caused by the escape of dust particles\nfrom the near-nucleus environment. The optical reflection spectrum is a nearly\nneutral continuum devoid of gaseous emission lines, from which we derive a\nlimit to the cyanide (CN) radical production rate of Q_CN <1.4e23/s and infer a\nmass loss rate <1.5 kg/s at the time of our observations.

The dark matter distribution in each of these\ngalaxies are calculated using the mass distribution derived from the observed\nlight distribution and the observed rotation curves. The theoretical\npredictions of the onset radii for the warps are then derived by applying a\nself-consistent linear response theory to the obtained mass models for 6\ngalaxies with rotation curves in the literature. By comparing the observed\nonset radii to the theoretical ones, we find that discs with constant thickness\ncan not explain the observations; moderately flaring discs are needed.

The submm emission is identified with a radio counterpart for\nwhich optical spectroscopy provides a redshift of z=4.76.

Thus it has characteristics similar to those of\nz~2 submm galaxies (SMGs), with a mix of starburst and obscured AGN signatures.\nThis demonstrates that ultraluminous starburst activity is not just restricted\nto the hosts of the most luminous (and hence rare) QSOs at z~5, but was also\noccurring in less extreme galaxies at a time when the Universe was less than\n10% of its current age. Assuming that we are seeing the major phase of star\nformation in this galaxy, then we demonstrate that it would be identified as a\nluminous distant red galaxy at z~3 and that the current estimate of the space\ndensity of z>4 SMGs is only sufficient to produce ~10% of the luminous red\ngalaxy population at these early times. However, this leaves open the\npossibility that some of these galaxies formed through less intense, but more\nextended star formation events. If the progenitors of all of the luminous red\ngalaxies at z~3 go through an ultraluminous starburst at z>4 then the required\nvolume density of z>4 SMGs will exceed that predicted by current galaxy\nformation models by more than an order of magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Feb 2009 21:18:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

A fundamental test of the accretion disk scenario is that the\ndifferentially rotating disk spectrum should produce a variation of rotational\nvelocity with the wavelength of observation, as spectra taken at longer\nwavelengths probe outer, more slowly rotating disk regions. Previous\nobservations of FU Ori have shown smaller rotation at near-infrared (~ 2.2\nmicron) wavelengths than observed at optical (~ 0.6 micron) wavelengths\nconsistent with the assumption of Keplerian rotation. Here we report a spectrum\nfrom the Phoenix instrument on Gemini South which shows that differential\n(slower) rotation continues to be observed out to ~ 5 micron. The observed\nspectrum is well matched by the prediction of our accretion disk model\npreviously constructed to match the observed spectral energy distribution and\nthe differential rotation at wavelengths < 2.2 micron. This kinematic result\nallows us to confirm our previous inference of a large outer radius (~ 1 AU)\nfor the rapidly accreting region of the FU Ori disk, which presents\ndifficulties for outburst models relying purely on thermal instability.

The oscillations exist throughout the whole observation, characterized by\na series of wave packets with nearly constant period, typically persisting for\n4-6 cycles with a lifetime of 20-30 min.

The\ngoal is to provide environmental diagnostics of major merger populations in\norder to test simulations against observations and provide further constraints\non major merger driven galaxy evolution scenarios. A halo sample is defined\nusing the maximum circular velocity, which is both well defined for subhalos\nand closely correlated with galaxy luminosity. Subhalos, including the\nprecursors of major mergers, are severely tidally stripped. Major mergers\nbetween subhalos are therefore extremely rare. Tidal stripping also suppresses\ndynamical friction, resulting in long major merger time scales when the more\nmassive halo does not host other subhalos. In contrast, when other subhalos are\npresent major merger time scales are several times shorter. This enhancement is\nlikely due to inelastic unbound collisions between subhalos. Following these\nresults, we predict that major mergers in group environments are dominated by\nmergers involving the central galaxy, that the specific merger rate is\nsuppressed in groups, and that the frequency of fainter companions is enhanced\nfor mergers and their remnants. We also observe an `assembly bias' in the major\nmerger rate in that mergers of galaxy-like halos are slightly suppressed in\noverdense environments while mergers of group-like halos are slightly enhanced.\nA dynamical explanation for this trend is advanced which calls on both tidal\neffects and interactions between bound halos beyond the virial radii of locally\ndynamically dominant halos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Feb 2009 00:06:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-07"}

The first uses the existence of couplings which\ndraw the solutions together as time goes to infinity. Such \"asymptotic\ncouplings\" were central to recent work on SPDEs on which this work builds. The\nemphasis here is on stochastic differential delay equations.Harris' celebrated\ntheorem states that if a Markov chain admits a Lyapunov function whose level\nsets are \"small\" (in the sense that transition probabilities are uniformly\nbounded from below), then it admits a unique invariant measure and transition\nprobabilities converge towards it at exponential speed. This convergence takes\nplace in a total variation norm, weighted by the Lyapunov function. A second\naim of this article is to replace the notion of a \"small set\" by the much\nweaker notion of a \"d-small set,\" which takes the topology of the underlying\nspace into account via a distance-like function d. With this notion at hand, we\nprove an analogue to Harris' theorem, where the convergence takes place in a\nWasserstein-like distance weighted again by the Lyapunov function.

Variable mass supply rate occurs, e.g., during disc state transitions,\nand in interacting eccentric binaries. It is, however, damped by the viscosity\nof the disc. Here, we calculate this damping in detail. We derive an analytical\ndescription of the propagation of the flow rate using the solution of\nLynden-Bell & Pringle, in which the disc is assumed to extend to infinity. In\nparticular, we derive the accretion-rate Green's function, and its Fourier\ntransform, which gives the fractional damping at a given variability frequency.\nWe then compare this model to that of a finite disc with the mass supply at its\nouter edge. We find significant differences with respect to the infinite disc\nsolution, which we find to overestimate the viscous damping. In particular, the\nasymptotic form of the Green's function is power-law for the infinite disc and\nexponential for the finite one. We then find a simple fitting form for the\nlatter, and also calculate its Fourier transform. In general, the damping\nbecomes very strong when the viscous time at the outer edge of the disc becomes\nlonger than the modulation time scale.

This\nscenario seems to be qualitatively consistent with most existing observations,\nincluding the dark cores in penumbral filaments reported by Scharmer et al.\nEach bright filament with dark core would be a system of two paired convective\nrolls with the dark core tracing the common lane where the plasma sinks down.\nThe magnetic loops would have a hot footpoint in one of the bright filament and\na cold footpoint in the dark core. The scenario fits in most of our theoretical\nprejudices (siphon flows along field lines, presence of overturning convection,\ndrag of field lines by downdrafts, etc). If the conjecture turns out to be\ncorrect, the mild upward and downward velocities observed in penumbrae must\nincrease upon improving the resolution. This and other observational tests to\nsupport or disprove the scenario are put forward.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Feb 2009 08:59:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

We analyse the\neffects of the inclusion of stellar magnetic braking by performing a\nphase-plane analysis of a simplified system of equations, including the braking\ntorque. The inclusion of magnetic braking is found to be important, and its\nneglect can result in a very different system history.

The rate function for the stationary\nworkload is expressed in term of the rate functions of the finite-horizon\nworkloads when the arrival processes have \\emph{i.i.d.} increments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Feb 2009 12:41:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-27"}

By now, the possibility of a rotating universe has been discussed\ncomprehensively in the framework of some types of Bianchi's models, such as\nType V, VII and IX \\cite{2,3}, and different approaches have been proposed to\nconstrain the rotation. Recent discoveries of some non-Gaussian properties of\nthe Cosmic Microwave Background Anisotropies (CMBA)\n\\cite{nG1,nG2,nG3,nG4,nG5,nG6,nG7}, such as the suppression of the quadrupole\nand the alignment of some multipoles draw attention to some Bianchi models with\nrotation \\cite{bi1,bi2}. However, cosmological data, such as those of the CMBA,\nstrongly prefer a homogeneous and isotropic model. Therefore, it is of interest\nto discuss the rotation of the universe as a perturbation of the\nRobertson-Walker metric, to constrain the rotating speed by cosmological data\nand to discuss whether it could be the origin of the non-Gaussian properties of\nthe CMBA mentioned above. Here, we derive the general form of the metric (up to\n2nd-order perturbations) which is compatible with the rotation perturbation in\na flat $\\Lambda$-CDM universe. By comparing the 2nd-order Sachs-Wolfe effect\n\\cite{4,5,6,7,8} due to rotation with the CMBA data, we constrain the angular\nspeed of the rotation to be less than $10^{-9}$ rad yr$^{-1}$ at the last\nscattering surface.

It is proved that for\nany positive integers $m,n, 3 \\le n \\le m$, the maximum value of $\\gamma(K)$,\nas $K$ runs through all $n$-dimensional polyhedral cones with $m$ extreme rays,\nequals $(n-1)(m-1)+1$ when $m$ is even or $m$ and $n$ are both odd, and is at\nleast $(n-1)(m-1)$ and at most $(n-1)(m-1)+1$ when $m$ is odd and $n$ is even.\nFor the cases when $m = n, m = n+1$ or $n = 3$, the cones $K$ and the\ncorresponding $K$-primitive matrices $A$ such that $\\gamma(K)$ and $\\gamma(A)$\nattain the maximum value are identified up to respectively linear isomorphism\nand cone-equivalence modulo positive scalar multiplication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Feb 2009 13:52:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-27"}

The astrophysical reality of the signal of\nvariability in HD 80606 is confirmed by observation with two independent\ntelescope systems, and checks against several reference stars in the field.\nDifferential photometry with respect to the nearby comparison star HD 80607\nprovides a precise light curve. Modelling of the light curve with a full\neccentric-orbit model indicates a planet/star-radius ratio of 0.1057 +/-\n0.0018, corresponding to a planet radius of 1.029 R_J for a solar-radius parent\nstar; and a precise orbital inclination of 89.285 +/- 0.023 degrees, giving a\ntotal transit duration of 12.1 +/- 0.4 hours. The planet hence joins HD 17156b\nin a class of highly eccentric transiting planets, in which HD 80606b has both\nthe longest period and most eccentric orbit. The recently reported discovery of\na secondary eclipse of HD 80606b by the Spitzer Space Observatory permits a\ncombined analysis with the mid-time of primary transit in which the orbital\nparameters of the system can be tightly constrained.
