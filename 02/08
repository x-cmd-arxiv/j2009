We study the adsorption of\ngraphene on metal substrates using first-principles calculations at the level\nof density functional theory. The bonding of graphene to Al, Ag, Cu, Au and\nPt(111) surfaces is so weak that its unique \"ultrarelativistic\" electronic\nstructure is preserved. The interaction does, however, lead to a charge\ntransfer that shifts the Fermi level by up to 0.5 eV with respect to the\nconical points. The crossover from p-type to n-type doping occurs for a metal\nwith a work function ~5.4 eV, a value much larger than the work function of\nfree-standing graphene, 4.5 eV. We develop a simple analytical model that\ndescribes the Fermi level shift in graphene in terms of the metal substrate\nwork function. Graphene interacts with and binds more strongly to Co, Ni, Pd\nand Ti. This chemisorption involves hybridization between graphene $p_z$-states\nand metal d-states that opens a band gap in graphene. The graphene work\nfunction is as a result reduced considerably. In a current-in-plane device\ngeometry this should lead to n-type doping of graphene.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Feb 2009 11:46:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

A suitably\ncovariant infinite-component localization is displayed, reflecting Bergmann's\nrealization that there are infinitely many conserved gravitational\nenergy-momenta. Initially use is made of a flat background metric (or rather,\nall of them) or connection, because the desired gauge invariance properties are\nobvious. Partial gauge-fixing then yields an appropriate covariant quantity\nwithout any background metric or connection; one version is the collection of\npseudotensors of a given type, such as the Einstein pseudotensor, in_every_\ncoordinate system. This solution to the gauge covariance problem is easily\nadapted to any pseudotensorial expression (Landau-Lifshitz, Goldberg,\nPapapetrou or the like) or to any tensorial expression built with a background\nmetric or connection. Thus the specific functional form can be chosen on\ntechnical grounds such as relating to Noether's theorem and yielding expected\nvalues of conserved quantities in certain contexts and then rendered covariant\nusing the procedure described here. The application to angular momentum\nlocalization is straightforward. Traditional objections to pseudotensors are\nbased largely on the false assumption that there is only one gravitational\nenergy rather than infinitely many.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Feb 2009 04:24:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2009 21:31:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-10"}

The simplest of such maps is the spherical\nproximity map which maps a point from the class of interest to a disk centered\nat the same point with radius being the distance to the closest point from the\nother class in the region. The spherical proximity map gave rise to class cover\ncatch digraph (CCCD) which was applied to pattern classification. Furthermore\nfor uniform data on the real line, the exact and asymptotic distribution of the\ndomination number of CCCDs were analytically available. In this article, we\ndetermine some appealing properties of the spherical proximity map in compact\nintervals on the real line and use these properties as a guideline for defining\nnew proximity maps in higher dimensions. Delaunay triangulation is used to\npartition the region of interest in higher dimensions. Furthermore, we\nintroduce the auxiliary tools used for the construction of the new proximity\nmaps, as well as some related concepts that will be used in the investigation\nand comparison of them and the resulting graphs. We characterize the geometry\ninvariance of PCDs for uniform data. We also provide some newly defined\nproximity maps in higher dimensions as illustrative examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Feb 2009 12:29:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-10"}

This\nresult is of interest for the giant void models that attempt to explain the\nsupernovae observations without Dark Energy. We find voids models with a\nhomogeneous big bang can be compatible with the observed small angle CMB, but\nonly if they exist in a positively curved universe.

A weak mean longitudinal magnetic field of\nthe order of a few hundred Gauss was detected in three beta Cephei stars and\ntwo stars suspected to be beta Cephei stars, in five SPB stars and eight stars\nsuspected to be SPB stars. Additionally, a longitudinal magnetic field at a\nlevel larger than 3sigma has been diagnosed in two normal B-type stars, the\nnitrogen-rich early B-type star HD52089 and in the B5 IV star HD153716. Roughly\none third of beta Cephei stars have detected magnetic fields: Out of 13 beta\nCephei stars studied to date with FORS1, four stars possess weak magnetic\nfields, and out of the sample of six suspected beta Cephei stars two show a\nweak magnetic field. The fraction of magnetic SPBs and candidate SPBs is found\nto be higher: roughly half of the 34 SPB stars have been found to be magnetic\nand among the 16 candidate SPBs eight stars possess magnetic fields. In an\nattempt to understand why only a fraction of pulsating stars exhibit magnetic\nfields, we studied the position of magnetic and non-magnetic pulsating stars in\nthe H-R diagram. We find that their domains in the H-R diagram largely overlap,\nand no clear picture emerges as to the possible evolution of the magnetic field\nacross the main sequence. It is possible that stronger fields tend to be found\nin stars with lower pulsating frequencies and smaller pulsating amplitudes. A\nsomewhat similar trend is found if we consider a correlation between the field\nstrength and the v sin i-values, i.e. stronger magnetic fields tend to be found\nin more slowly rotating stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Feb 2009 15:43:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The source of the hard X-ray emission is the shocked secondary\nwind. We argue that, by itself, the observed X-ray flux cannot teach us much\nabout the orientation of the semi-major axis. Minor adjustment of some unknown\nparameters of the binary system allows to fit the X-ray light curve with almost\nany inclination angle and orientation. The column density and X-ray emission\nmeasure, on the other hand, impose strong constrains on the orientation. We\nimprove our previous calculations and show that the column density is more\ncompatible with an orientation where for most of the time the secondary - the\nhotter, less massive star - is behind the primary star. The secondary comes\ncloser to the observer only for a short time near periastron passage. The\nten-week X-ray deep minimum, which results from a large decrease in the\nemission measure, implies that the regular secondary wind is substantially\nsuppressed during that period. This suppression is most likely resulted by\naccretion of mass from the dense wind of the primary luminous blue variable\n(LBV) star. The accretion from the equatorial plane might lead to the formation\nof a polar outflow. We suggest that the polar outflow contributes to the soft\nX-ray emission during the X-ray minimum; the other source is the shocked\nsecondary wind in the tail. The conclusion that accretion occurs at each\nperiastron passage, every five and a half years, implies that accretion had\noccurred at a much higher rate during the 20 Great Eruption of Eta Carinae in\nthe 19th century.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Feb 2009 15:48:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2009 16:04:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}
