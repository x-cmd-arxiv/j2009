However, the exact nature of the\nejected material and the mechanisms that give birth to these phenomena are yet\nto be unraveled. Recent simultaneous radio and X-ray observations on several\nsources point to a coronal nature of the ejected material.

We perform a perturbative\nrenormalization group (RG) study in a $4-\\epsilon$ dimensional space. We\ndevelop an RG scheme that eliminates the phase and frequency of the\noscillations using a scale-dependent oscillating reference frame. Within a\nCallan-Symanzik RG scheme to two-loop order in perturbation theory, we find\nthat the RG fixed point is formally related to the one of the model $A$\ndynamics of the real Ginzburg-Landau theory with an O(2) symmetry of the order\nparameter. Therefore, the dominant critical exponents for coupled oscillators\nare the same as for this equilibrium field theory. This formal connection with\nan equilibrium critical point imposes a relation between the correlation and\nresponse functions of coupled oscillators in the critical regime. Since the\nsystem operates far from thermodynamic equilibrium, a strong violation of the\nfluctuation-dissipation relation occurs and is characterized by a universal\ndivergence of an effective temperature. The formal relation between critical\noscillators and equilibrium critical points suggests that long-range phase\norder exists in critical oscillators above two dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Feb 2009 13:24:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Feb 2009 20:56:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 10 Feb 2009 21:01:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-22"}

This situation highlights the need for non-perturbative\ninformation about criticality in two spatial dimensions (three space-time\ndimensions), which is a longstanding challenge. As a step toward addressing\nthese issues, we present evidence that the O(4) vector model is dual to a\ntheory of Dirac fermions coupled to both SU(2) and U(1) gauge fields. Both\nfield theories arise as low-energy, long-wavelength descriptions of a\nfrustrated XY model on the triangular lattice. Abelian boson-vortex duality of\nthe lattice model, together with the emergence of larger non-abelian symmetry\nat low energies, leads to this rare example of duality in two spatial\ndimensions involving non-abelian global symmetry and fermions, but without\nsupersymmetry. The duality can also be viewed as a bosonization of the Dirac\nfermion gauge theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Feb 2009 00:56:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 May 2009 17:14:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 19 May 2009 15:47:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-28"}

These dynamical parameters were compared\nto the gravitational and turbulent properties of the clump.\n  We show that the population of protostellar outflows identified in NGC 2264-C\nare likely to contribute a significant fraction of the observed turbulence but\ncannot efficiently support the protocluster against global collapse. Gravity\nappears to largely dominate the dynamics of the NGC 2264-C clump at the present\ntime. It is however possible that an increase in the star formation rate during\nthe further evolution of the protocluster will trigger sufficient outflows to\nfinally halt the contraction of the cloud.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Feb 2009 08:04:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Together the agents create a network (a subgraph of the host graph)\nwhile selfishly minimizing the link creation costs plus the sum of the\ndistances to all other players (usage cost). In this paper, we pursue two\nimportant facets of the network creation game. First, we study extensively a\nnatural version of the game, called the cooperative model, where nodes can\ncollaborate and share the cost of creating any edge in the host graph. We prove\nthe first nontrivial bounds in this model, establishing that the price of\nanarchy is polylogarithmic in n for all values of &#945; in complete host\ngraphs. This bound is the first result of this type for any version of the\nnetwork creation game; most previous general upper bounds are polynomial in n.\nInterestingly, we also show that equilibrium graphs have polylogarithmic\ndiameter for the most natural range of \\alpha (at most n polylg n). Second, we\nstudy the impact of the natural assumption that the host graph is a general\ngraph, not necessarily complete. This model is a simple example of nonuniform\ncreation costs among the edges (effectively allowing weights of \\alpha and\n\\infty). We prove the first assemblage of upper and lower bounds for this\ncontext, stablishing nontrivial tight bounds for many ranges of \\alpha, for\nboth the unilateral and cooperative versions of network creation. In\nparticular, we establish polynomial lower bounds for both versions and many\nranges of \\alpha, even for this simple nonuniform cost model, which sharply\ncontrasts the conjectured constant bounds for these games in complete (uniform)\ngraphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Feb 2009 10:31:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-10"}

We address this question using the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor\n(nAChR) as the exemplar. The nAChR is an integral membrane protein which forms\na cation selective channel gated by neurotransmitter binding to its\nextracellular domain. A hydrophobic gating model has been proposed for the\nnAChR, whereby the pore is incompletely occluded in the closed state channel,\nwith a narrow hydrophobic central gate region which presents an energetic\nbarrier to ion permeation. The nAChR pore is lined by a parallel bundle of five\nM2 alpha-helices, with the gate formed by three rings of hydrophobic sidechains\n(9', 13', and 17' of M2). A number of models have been proposed to describe the\nnature of the conformational change underlying the closed to open transition of\nthe nAChR. These models involve different degrees of M2 helix displacement,\nrotation, and/or kinking. In this study, we use a simple pore expansion method\n(previously used to model opening of potassium channels) to generate a series\nof progressively wider models of the nAChR transmembrane domain. Continuum\nelectrostatics calculations are used to assess the change in the barrier height\nof the hydrophobic gate as a function of pore expansion. The results suggest\nthat an increase in radius of Delta r ~ 1.5 angstrom is sufficient to\nfunctionally open the pore without, for example, a requirement for rotation of\nthe M2 helices. This is evaluated in the context of current mutational and\nstructural data on the nAChR and its homologues.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Feb 2009 11:42:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-12"}

The ion density\nand the mean velocity are found to oscillate whereas the velocity dispersion\nstays constant, which indicates that ionization and acceleration layers have\nidentical dynamics. Finally, variations over time of the electric field are for\nthe first time experimentally evidenced in a crossed-field discharge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Feb 2009 12:53:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-10"}

Through a particle-hole\ntransformation these results can be related to the underdoped repulsive Hubbard\nmodel, where the FFLO phase takes the form of a particle-hole condensate that\nexhibits a spontaneous restoration of spin symmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Feb 2009 15:05:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-10"}

This problem is often described starting\nfrom the simple one-dimensional model of two parallel charged plates. Several\ndifferent approaches to this problem exist, focusing on different features. In\nmany cases, an intuitive expression of the pressure exerted on the plates is\nproposed, which includes an electrostatic plus an osmotic contribution. We\npresent an explicit and self-consistent derivation of this formula for the\ngeneral case of any charge densities on the plates and any salt solution,\nobtained in the framework of the Poisson-Boltzmann theory. We also show that,\ndepending on external constraints, the correct thermodynamic potential can\ndiffer from the usual PB free energy. The resulting expression predicts, for\nasymmetric, oppositely charged plates, the existence of a non trivial\nequilibrium position with the plates separated by a finite distance. It is\ntherefore crucial, in order to study the kinetic stability of the corresponding\nenergy minimum, to obtain its explicit dependence on the plates charge\ndensities and on the ion concentration. An analytic expression for the position\nand value of the corresponding energy minimum has been derived in 1975 by\nOhshima [Ohshima H., Colloid and Polymer Sci. 253, 150-157 (1975)] but,\nsurprisingly, this important result seems to be overlooked today. We retrieve\nthe expressions obtained by Ohshima in a simpler formalism, more familiar to\nthe physics community, and give a physical interpretation of the observed\nbehavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Feb 2009 15:48:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}
