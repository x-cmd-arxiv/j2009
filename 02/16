These mechanisms\nutilize the extended five-dimensional (5D) electroweak gauge symmetry [SU(2)_L\nx SU(2)_R x U(1)_X] which is already strongly motivated in order to satisfy\nelectroweak precision tests in this framework. New choices of representations\nfor leptons under this symmetry (naturally) can allow small mixing angles for\nleft-handed (LH) charged leptons and simultaneously large mixing angles for\ntheir SU(2)_L partners, i.e., the LH neutrinos, with the neutrino data being\naccounted for by the latter mixings. Enhancement of charged lepton flavor\nviolation by the large mixing angle observed in leptonic charged currents,\nwhich is present for the minimal choice of representations where the LH charged\nlepton and neutrino mixing angles are similar, can thus be avoided in these\nmodels. This idea might also be useful for suppressing the contributions to\nB_{d, s} mixing in this framework and in order to suppress flavor violation\nfrom superpartners (instead of from KK modes) in 5D \"flavorful supersymmetry\"\nmodels. Additionally, the less minimal representations can provide custodial\nprotection for shifts in couplings of fermions to Z and, in turn, further\nsuppress charged lepton flavor-violation from tree-level Z exchange in the\nwarped extra-dimensional scenario. As a result, ~O(3) TeV KK mass scale can be\nsimultaneously consistent with charged lepton flavor violation and neutrino\ndata, even without any particular structure in the 5D flavor parameters in the\nframework of a warped extra dimension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Feb 2009 03:14:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2009 21:22:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-21"}

We find that the sigma_v of groups is\nstrongly correlated with the group projected b/a and size, with elongated and\nlarger groups having a lower sigma_v. Such a correlation could be attributed to\nthe dynamical evolution of groups, with groups in the initial stages of\nformation, having small sigma_v, a large size and an elongated shape that\nreflects the anisotropic accretion of galaxies along filamentary structures.\nThe same sort of correlations, however, could also be reproduced in\nprolate-like groups, if the net galaxy motion is preferentially along the group\nelongation, since then the groups oriented close to the line of sight will\nappear more spherical, will have a small projected size and large sigma_v,\nwhile groups oriented close to the sky-plane will appear larger in projection,\nmore elongated, and will have smaller sigma_v. We perform tests that relate\nonly to the dynamical evolution of groups (eg., calculating the fraction of\nearly type galaxies in groups) and indeed we find a strong positive (negative)\ncorrelation between the group sigma_v (projected major axis) with the fraction\nof early type galaxies.

The frequency shift of each of the 2l+1 m spectra of a given (n,l)\nmultiplet is chosen that maximizes the likelihood of the m-averaged spectrum. A\nhigh signal-to-noise ratio can result from combining individual low\nsignal-to-noise-ratio, individual-m spectra, none of which would yield a strong\nenough peak to measure. We apply the technique to GONG and MDI data and show\nthat it allows us to measure modes with lower frequencies than those obtained\nwith classic peak-fitting analysis of the individual-m spectra. We measure\ntheir central frequencies, splittings, asymmetries, lifetimes, and amplitudes.\nThe low-frequency, low- and intermediate-angular degrees rendered accessible by\nthis new method correspond to modes that are sensitive to the deep solar\ninterior down to the core and to the radiative interior. Moreover, the\nlow-frequency modes have deeper upper turning points, and are thus less\nsensitive to the turbulence and magnetic fields of the outer layers, as well as\nuncertainties in the nature of the external boundary condition. As a result of\ntheir longer lifetimes (narrower linewidths) at the same signal-to-noise ratio\nthe determination of the frequencies of lower-frequency modes is more accurate,\nand the resulting inversions should be more precise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Feb 2009 19:07:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

The numerical calculations reproduce\nanalytical results in the metallic regime revealing the crossover between the\nskew scattering mechanism dominating in the clean systems and intrinsic\nmechanism dominating in the moderately dirty systems. As we increase the\ndisorder further, the AHE starts to diminish due to the spectral broadening of\nthe quasiparticles.

We therefore need to follow chemical reactions, both in the\ngas phase and on dust grains, as well as gas-grain interactions, to predict the\nabundance distributions. Our aim is to model the abundances of molecules, in\nthe gas phase and on grain mantles in the form of ice, from prestellar core\ncollapse to disk formation. We use a 2-dimensional hydrodynamical simulation as\na physical model from which we take the density, temperature, and the flow of\nthe gas. Trace particles, moving along with the gas, are used to follow the\nchemistry during prestellar core collapse and disk formation. The evolution of\nthe abundances and the composition of ices on grain mantles were compared to\nobservations. We also investigated the initial abundances to be adopted in more\ndetailed modeling of protoplanetary disks by following the chemical evolution\nof trace particles accreting onto the disk. Fractional abundances of HCO+,\nN2H+, H2CO, HC3N, and CH3OH from our model with grain surface reactions provide\na good match to observations, while abundances of CO, CS, SO, HCN, and HNC show\nbetter agreement without grain surface reactions.

In this paper, particular attention is paid to the dependence of\nradiative feedback on the mass of source Pop III star. UV radiation from the\nsource star can work to impede the secondary star formation through the\nphotoheating and photodissociation processes. Recently, Susa & Umemura (2006)\nhave shown that the ionizing radiation alleviates the negative effect by\nH_2-dissociating radiation from 120$M_sun PopIII star, since an H_2 shell\nformed ahead of an ionizing front can effectively shield H_2-dissociating\nradiation. On the other hand, it is expected that the negative feedback by\nH_2-dissociating radiation can be predominant if a source star is less massive,\nsince a ratio of the H_2-dissociating photon number to the ionizing photon\nnumber becomes higher. In order to investigate the radiative feedback effects\nfrom such less massive stars, we perform three-dimensional radiation\nhydrodynamic simulations, incorporating the radiative transfer effect of\nionizing and H_2-dissociating radiation. As a result, we find that if a source\nstar is less massive than ~25M_sun, the ionizing radiation cannot suppress the\nnegative feedback of H_2-dissociating radiation. Therefore, the fate of the\nneighboring clouds around such less massive stars is determined solely by the\nflux of H_2-dissociating radiation from source stars. With making analytic\nestimates of H_2 shell formation and its shielding effect, we derive the\ncriteria for radiation hydrodynamic feedback depending on the source star mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Feb 2009 03:30:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

However, recent single molecule experiment\nreported that proteins can diffuse on DNA. This suggests that the interactions\nbetween proteins and DNA play a role during the target search even far from the\nspecific site. It is unclear how these non-specific interactions optimize the\nsearch process, and how the protein structure comes into play. Each nucleotide\nbeing negatively charged, one may think that the positive surface of DNA-BPs\nshould electrostatically collapse onto DNA. Here we show by means of Monte\nCarlo simulations and analytical calculations that a counter-intuitive\nrepulsion between the two oppositely charged macromolecules exists at a\nnanometer range. We also show that this repulsion is due to a local increase of\nthe osmotic pressure exerted by the ions which are trapped at the interface.\nFor the concave shape of DNA-BPs, and for realistic protein charge densities,\nwe find that the repulsion pushes the protein in a free energy minimum at a\ndistance from DNA. As a consequence, a favourable path exists along which\nproteins can slide without interacting with the DNA bases. When a protein\nencounters its target, the osmotic barrier is completely counter-balanced by\nthe H-bond interaction, thus enabling the sequence recognition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Feb 2009 15:31:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Our sample of halo subdwarfs is\nextracted via a reduced proper motion diagram and distances are obtained using\nphotometric parallaxes, thus giving full phase space information. The tilt of\nthe velocity ellipsoid with respect to the spherical polar coordinate system is\ncomputed and found to be consistent with zero for two of the three tilt angles,\nand very small for the third. We prove that if the inner halo is in a\nsteady-state and the triaxial velocity ellipsoid is everywhere aligned in\nspherical polar coordinates, then the potential must be spherically symmetric.\nThe detectable, but very mild, misalignment with spherical polars is consistent\nwith the perturbative effects of the Galactic disk on a spherical dark halo.\nBanana orbits are generated at the 1:1 resonance (in horizontal and vertical\nfrequency) by the disk. They populate Galactic potentials at the typical radii\nof our subdwarf sample, along with the much more dominant short-axis tubes.\nHowever, on geometric grounds alone, the tilt cannot vanish for the banana\norbits and this leads to a slight, but detectable, misalignment. We argue that\nthe tilt of the stellar halo velocity ellipsoid therefore provides a hitherto\nlargely neglected but important line of argument that the Milky Way's dark\nhalo, which dominates the potential, must be nearly spherical.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Feb 2009 15:36:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

The existence\nof an optimal subspace dimension for this confinement is hypothesized.\nTheoretical arguments in favor of the present approach are supported by\nnumerical experiments in a simple perfect non-linear model scenario.
