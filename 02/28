These values are very close to those observed in experiments.\nThe value of |V_{ud}| (theta_C) is based on the fact that different Z2\nsubgroups of D14 are conserved in the up and down quark sector. In order to\nachieve this, D14 is accompanied by a Z3 symmetry. The spontaneous breaking of\nD14 is induced by flavons, which are scalar gauge singlets. The quark mass\nhierarchy is partly due to the flavor group D14 and partly due to a\nFroggatt-Nielsen symmetry U(1)_{FN} under which only the right-handed quarks\ntransform. The model is completely natural in the sense that the hierarchies\namong the quark masses and mixing angles are generated with the help of\nsymmetries. The issue of the vacuum alignment of the flavons is solved up to a\nsmall number of degeneracies, leaving four different possible values for\n|V_{ud}|. Out of these, only one of them leads to a phenomenological viable\nmodel. A study of the Z2 subgroup breaking terms shows that the results\nachieved in the symmetry limit are only slightly perturbed. At the same time\nthey allow |V_{ud}| (theta_C) to be well inside the small experimental error\nbars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Feb 2009 18:11:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-15"}

While much progress has been made in recent years in\nconstraining the cosmological parameters, and in reconstructing the evolution\nin the large--scale structure of the dark matter distribution, we still lack an\nunderstanding of the evolution of the baryonic component of the Universe.\n  Located at nodes of the cosmic web, clusters of galaxies are the largest\ncollapsed structures in the Universe with total masses up to 10$^{15}$\nM$_{\\sun}$. Over 80% of their mass resides in the form of dark matter. The\nremaining mass is composed of baryons, most of which (about 85%) is a diffuse,\nhot plasma that radiates primarily in X-rays. X-ray observations of the\nevolving cluster population provide a unique opportunity to address such open\nand fundamental questions as: How do hot diffuse baryons dynamically evolve in\ndark matter potentials? How and when was the excess energy which we observe in\nthe intergalactic medium generated? What is the cosmic history of heavy-element\nproduction and circulation?\n  Our current knowledge comes primarily from detailed studies of clusters in\nthe relatively nearby Universe (z$<$0.5).

The cylinders are electrically connected\nthrough a remote, perfectly conducting endcap, which allows a radial electric\ncurrent to pass through the liquid. The radial current interacting with the\naxial component of magnetic field gives rise to the azimuthal electromagnetic\nforce, which destabilizes the base flow by making its angular momentum decrease\nradially outwards. This instability, which we refer to as the\npseudo--magnetorotational instability (MRI), looks like an MRI although its\nmechanism is basically centrifugal. In a helical magnetic field, the radial\ncurrent interacting with the azimuthal component of the field gives rise to an\naxial electromagnetic force, which drives a longitudinal circulation. First,\nthis circulation advects the Taylor vortices generated by the centrifugal\ninstability, which results in a traveling wave as in the helical MRI (HMRI).\nHowever, the direction of travel of this wave is opposite to that of the true\nHMRI. Second, at sufficiently strong differential rotation, the longitudinal\nflow becomes hydrodynamically unstable itself. For electrically connected\ncylinders in a helical magnetic field, hydrodynamic instability is possible at\nany sufficiently strong differential rotation. In this case, there is no\nhydrodynamic stability limit defined in the terms of the critical ratio of\nrotation rates of inner and outer cylinders that would allow one to distinguish\na hydrodynamic instability from the HMRI. These effects can critically\ninterfere with experimental as well as numerical determination of MRI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Feb 2009 19:06:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 28 Feb 2009 18:05:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 21 Jun 2009 14:38:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-01"}

While the CPM modulator is common to\nall transmit antennas, the correction filter bank applies different correction\nunits to each antenna. Thereby desirable code properties as orthogonality and\nfull diversity are achievable with just a slightly larger bandwidth demand.\nThis new representation has three main advantages. First, it allows to easily\ngeneralize the orthogonality condition to any arbitrary number of transmit\nantennas. Second, for a quite general set of correction functions that we\ndetail, it can be proved that full diversity is achieved. Third, by separating\nthe modulation and correction steps inside the receiver, a simpler receiver can\nbe designed as a bank of data independent inverse correction filters followed\nby a single CPM demodulator.
