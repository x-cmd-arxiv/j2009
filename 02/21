We find that $J_{i,j}(R)$\nhas an oscillatory character with an envelop decaying as $1/R^3$ along the\nstripe-direction while it is very short range along the diagonal direction and\nantiferromagnetic. A brief discussion of the neutron scattering determination\nof these exchange constants from a single crystal sample with orthorhombic\ntwinning is given. The lattice parameter dependence of the exchange constants,\n$dJ_{i,j}/da$ are calculated for a simple spin-Peierls like model to explain\nthe fine details of the tetragonal-orthorhombic phase transition.

Since treating iron as magnetic ion always gives much better\nresults than non-magnetic ones and since there is no large c-axis reduction\nduring the normal to superconducting phase transition, the iron magnetic moment\nshould be present in Fe-pnictides at all times.

One method employs a direct fit to a modified\nblackbody SED; the other involves a comparison of flux ratios to an analytical\nprediction. Fitting fluxes near the SED peak produces inaccurate temperature\nand dust spectral index estimates due to the line of sight temperature (and\ndensity) variations. Longer wavelength fluxes in the Rayleigh-Jeans part of the\nspectrum (>~ 600 micron for typical cores) may more accurately recover the\nspectral index, but both methods are very sensitive to noise. The temperature\nestimate approaches the density weighted temperature, or \"column temperature,\"\nof the source as short wavelength fluxes are excluded. An inverse temperature -\nspectral index correlation naturally results from SED fitting, due to the\ninaccurate isothermal assumption, as well as noise uncertainties. We show that\nabove some \"threshold\" temperature, the temperatures estimated through the flux\nratio method can be highly inaccurate. In general, observations with widely\nseparated wavelengths, and including shorter wavelengths, result in higher\nthreshold temperatures; such observations thus allow for more accurate\ntemperature estimates of sources with temperatures less than the threshold\ntemperature. When only three fluxes are available, a constrained fit, where the\nspectral index is fixed, produces less scatter in the temperature estimate when\ncompared to the estimate from the flux ratio method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Feb 2009 21:02:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

The dynamic of the latter are described by a dynamical exponent\n$z$ depending on the nature of the transition. Second, we consider the Kondo\nbreakdown model for QCP's, one possible scenario for heavy-fermion quantum\ntransitions, for which the effective theory is given by a gauge theory in terms\nof conduction electrons, spinons for localized spins, holons for hybridization\nfluctuations, and gauge bosons for collective spin excitations.

The relativistic electrons producing this diffuse synchrotron\nemission should also produce inverse Compton emission that becomes competitive\nwith thermal emission from the ICM at hard X-ray energies. Thus far, claimed\ndetections of this emission in Coma are controversial (Fusco-Femiano et al.\n2004; Rossetti & Molendi 2004). We present a Suzaku HXD-PIN observation of the\nComa cluster in order to nail down its non-thermal hard X-ray content. The\ncontribution of thermal emission to the HXD-PIN spectrum is constrained by\nsimultaneously fitting thermal and non-thermal models to it and a spatially\nequivalent spectrum derived from an XMM-Newton mosaic of the Coma field\n(Schuecker et al. 2004). We fail to find statistically significant evidence for\nnon-thermal emission in the spectra, which are better described by only a\nsingle or multi-temperature model for the ICM. Including systematic\nuncertainties, we derive a 90% upper limit on the flux of non-thermal emission\nof 6.0x10^-12 erg/s/cm^2 (20-80 keV, for photon index of 2.0), which implies a\nlower limit on the cluster-averaged magnetic field of B>0.15 microG.

However, if\nthe non-thermal hard X-ray emission in Coma is more spatially extended than the\nobserved radio halo, the Suzaku HXD-PIN may miss some fraction of the emission.\nA detailed investigation indicates that ~50-67% of the emission might go\nundetected, which could make our limit consistent with these detections. The\nthermal interpretation of the hard Coma spectrum is consistent with recent\nanalyses of INTEGRAL (Eckert et al. 2007) and Swift (Ajello et al. 2009) data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Feb 2009 21:00:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

We find no indication that 133P and 176P are\ncompositionally unique among other dynamically-similar (but inactive) members\nof the Themis family, in agreement with previous assertions that the two\nobjects most likely formed in-situ. We also note that low albedo (p_R<0.075)\nremains a consistent feature of all cometary (i.e., icy) bodies, whether they\noriginate in the inner solar system (the main-belt comets) or in the outer\nsolar system (all other comets).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Feb 2009 23:24:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

SuperclusterA in the extragalactic HII region NGC2363 is remarkable\nfor the hypersonic gas seen as faint extended broad emission lines with a full\nwidth zero intensity of 7000km/s. Aims. We explore the possibility that the\nobserved broad profiles are the result of the interaction of a high velocity\ncluster wind with dense photoionized clumps. Methods. The geometry considered\nis that of near static photoionized condensations at the surface of which\nturbulent mixing layers arise as a result of the interaction with the hot wind.\nThe approximative treatment of turbulence is carried out using the mixing\nlength approach of Canto & Raga. The code mappings Ic is used to derive the\nmean quantities describing the flow and to compute the line emissivities within\nthe turbulent layers. The velocity projection in three dimensions of the line\nsources is carried out analytically. Results. A fast entraining wind of up to\n~4300km/s appears to be required to reproduce the faint wings of the broad\nH-alpha and [O III] profiles. A slower wind of 3500km/s, however, can still\nreproduce the bulk of the broad component and does provide a better fit than an\nad hoc Gaussian profile. Conclusions. Radial acceleration in 3D (away from\nsupercluster A) of the emission gas provides a reasonable first order fit to\nthe broad line component. No broad component is predicted for the [N II] and [S\nII] lines, as observed. The wind velocity required is uncomfortably high and\nalternative processes that would provide comparable constant acceleration of\nthe emission gas up to 4000km/s might have to be considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Feb 2009 00:34:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2009 22:46:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Various studies show that within a purely electronic\nmodel on the $\\theta$-type lattice with the on-site $U$ and the nearest\nneighbor $V_p$ and $V_c$ interactions, the diagonal stripe, c-axis three-fold,\nand the vertical stripe charge correlations are favored in the regime $V_p<\nV_c$, $V_p\\sim V_c$, and $V_p> V_c$, respectively. In the realistic parameter\nregime of $V_p\\sim V_c$, there is a competition between c-axis three fold state\nand the diagonal stripe state. Since these are different from the\nexperimentally observed a-axis three fold and the horizontal stripe charge\ncorrelations, additional effects have to be included in order to understand the\nexperiments. The electron-lattice coupling, which tends to distort the lattice\ninto the $\\theta_d$-type, is found to favor the horizontal stripe state,\nsuggesting that the occurrence of this stripe ordering in the actual materials\nmay not be of purely electronic origin. On the other hand, distant\nelectron-electron interactions have to be considered in order to understand the\na-axis three fold correlation, whose wave vector is close to the nesting vector\nof the Fermi surface. These studies seem to suggest that the minimal model to\nunderstand the charge correlation in $\\theta$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2X$ may be more\ncomplicated than expected. Future problems regarding the competition between\ndifferent types of charge correlations are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Feb 2009 02:01:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Vortex loops composing the vortex tangle can move as a whole with\nsome drift velocity depending on their structure and their length. The flux of\nlength, energy, momentum etc. executed by the moving vortex loops takes a\nplace. Situation here is exactly the same as in usual classical kinetic theory\nwith the difference that the \"carriers\" of various physical quantities are not\nthe point particles, but extended objects (vortex loops), which possess an\ninfinite number of degrees of freedom with very involved dynamics. We offer to\nfulfill investigation basing on supposition that vortex loops have a Brownian\nstructure with the only degree of freedom, namely, lengths of loops $l$. This\nconception allows us to study dynamics of the vortex tangle on the basis of the\nkinetic equation for the distribution function $n(l,t)$ of the density of a\nloop in the space of their lengths. Imposing the coordinate dependence on the\ndistribution function $n(l,\\mathbf{% r},t)$ and modifying the \"kinetic\"\nequation with regard to inhomogeneous situation, we are able to investigate\nvarious problem on the transport processes in superfluid turbulence. In this\npaper we derive relation for the flux of the vortex line density\n$\\mathcal{L}(x,t)$. The correspoding evolution of quantity $\\mathcal{L}(x,t)$\nobeys the diffusion type equation as it can be expected from dimensional\nanalysis. The according diffusion coefficient is evaluated from calculation of\nthe (size dependent) free path of the vortex loops. We use this equation to\ndescribe the decay of the vortex tangle at very low temperature.

The motion is driven by the\ngiven difference of potentials in one direction and constant external\nelectrical field $\\vE_\\text{out}$ in another direction in the plane of a film.\nTo derive the model we employ the spatial averaging over the normal coordinate\nto a film that leads to the average Reynolds stress that is proportional to\n$|\\vE_\\text{out}|^3$. This stress generates tangential velocity in the vicinity\nof the edges of a film that, in turn, causes the rotational motion of a liquid.\nThe proposed model is aimed to explain the experimental observations of the\n\\emph{liquid film motor} (see arXiv:0805.0490v2).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Feb 2009 11:27:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-24"}

The\nsimulation used in the previous work suffers from the overcooling problem which\ncauses the central galaxies of large halos too massive. This may result in a\nshortened merger time-scale compared to that in the real universe. We run a\nsimilar simulation, but the stellar mass is significantly reduced to model\nanother extreme case of low stellar mass. Our result shows that the merger\ntime-scale is little affected by the star formation recipes, except for the\nsatellites in nearly radial orbits which show a 22 percent higher time-scale in\nthe lower stellar mass case. Since the radial orbits only account for a small\npart of the satellites' orbits, the fitting formula in Jiang et al.(2008) is\nstill applicable to a reasonable accuracy, nearly immune to the uncertainty in\nthe baryonic physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Feb 2009 11:28:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}
