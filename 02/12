The inclusion of redshift\ndistortions provides a new cosmological handle in the ISW spectrum, which can\nhelp constrain dark energy parameters, curvature and alternative cosmologies.\nCode is available on request and will soon be added as a module to the iCosmo\nplatform (http://www.icosmo.org)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Feb 2009 18:20:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-12"}

More than\na century after its discovery, this \"Blazhko effect\" still lacks acceptable\ntheoretical understanding. In one of the plausible models for explaining the\nphenomenon, the modulation is caused by the effects of a magnetic field. So\nfar, the available observational data have not allowed us to either support nor\nrule out the presence of a magnetic field in RR Lyrae stars. We intend to\ndetermine whether RR Lyrae stars are generally characterized by the presence of\na magnetic field organized on a large scale. With the help of the FORS1\ninstrument at the ESO VLT we performed a spectropolarimetric survey of 17\nrelatively bright southern RR Lyrae stars, both Blazhko stars and non-modulated\nstars, and determined their mean longitudinal magnetic field with a typical\nerror bar < 30 G. All our measurements of the mean longitudinal magnetic field\nresulted in null detections within 3 sigma. From our data we can set an upper\nlimit for the strength of the dipole component of the magnetic fields of RR\nLyrae stars to ~ 130 G. Because of the limitations intrinsic to the diagnostic\ntechnique, we cannot exclude the presence of higher order multipolar\ncomponents. The outcome of this survey clarifies that the Blazhko modulation in\nthe pulsation of RR Lyrae stars is not correlated with the presence of a\nstrong, quasi-dipolar magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Feb 2009 19:20:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-02"}

For each of these fields, various algorithms\nand techniques, which have been developed to leverage sparsity, are described\nsuccinctly. The common benefits of significant reduction in sampling rate and\nprocessing manipulations are revealed.\n  The key applications of sparse signal processing are sampling, coding,\nspectral estimation, array processing, component analysis, and multipath\nchannel estimation. In terms of reconstruction algorithms, linkages are made\nwith random sampling, compressed sensing and rate of innovation. The redundancy\nintroduced by channel coding in finite/real Galois fields is then related to\nsampling with similar reconstruction algorithms. The methods of Prony,\nPisarenko, and MUSIC are next discussed for sparse frequency domain\nrepresentations. Specifically, the relations of the approach of Prony to an\nannihilating filter and Error Locator Polynomials in coding are emphasized; the\nPisarenko and MUSIC methods are further improvements of the Prony method. Such\nspectral estimation methods is then related to multi-source location and DOA\nestimation in array processing. The notions of sparse array beamforming and\nsparse sensor networks are also introduced. Sparsity in unobservable source\nsignals is also shown to facilitate source separation in SCA; the algorithms\ndeveloped in this area are also widely used in compressed sensing. Finally, the\nmultipath channel estimation problem is shown to have a sparse formulation;\nalgorithms similar to sampling and coding are used to estimate OFDM channels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Feb 2009 16:58:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-12"}

Maurras (1977) and Camion and Maurras (1982) introduced\na family of inequalities, that we call forbidden set inequalities, which can be\nused to cut off those solutions. However, these inequalities are in general not\nfacet defining for the polyhedron associated with $\\Pi_c$. Kaibel and Stephan\n(2007) showed how one can combine integer characterizations for cycle and path\npolytopes and a modified form of forbidden set inequalities to give facet\ndefining integer representations for the cardinality restricted versions of\nthese polytopes. Motivated by this work, we apply the same approach on the\nmatroid polytope. It is well known that the so-called rank inequalities\ntogether with the nonnegativity constraints provide a complete linear\ndescription of the matroid polytope (see Edmonds (1971). By essentially adding\nthe forbidden set inequalities in an appropriate form, we obtain a complete\nlinear description of the cardinality constrained matroid polytope which is the\nconvex hull of the incidence vectors of those independent sets that have a\nfeasible cardinality. Moreover, we show how the separation problem for the\nforbidden set inequalities can be reduced to that for the rank inequalities. We\nalso give necessary and sufficient conditions for a forbidden set inequality to\nbe facet defining.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Feb 2009 16:38:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-12"}

After a critical reassessment of how the\nCP-symmetry is broken within the MFV framework, all possible CP-violating\nphases are introduced. From the strong hierarchy of their contributions to the\nElectric Dipole Moments (EDMs), these phases are split into three classes:\nflavor-blind, flavor-diagonal and flavor off-diagonal. In particular, the\nphases from the neutrino sector belong to the last class; they start to\ncontribute only at the second order in the mass-insertion approximation and\nhave thus a negligible effect. It is then shown that to each class of phases\ncorresponds a unique largely dominant term in the MFV expansion. Numerically,\nfor a realistic range of MSSM and neutrino parameters, such that B(mu --> e\ngamma) does not exceed its experimental bound, the three types of phases are\nfound to be allowed by the current bound on the electron EDM, though the next\ngeneration of experiments should constrain tightly the flavor-blind phase.\nFinally, we relax the MFV hypothesis and show how in the general MSSM, the MFV\noperator basis can be used to judge of the naturality of the slepton\nsoft-breaking terms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Feb 2009 17:46:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2009 16:40:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

We show that the problem is undecidable starting from dimension\nfour even when the number of matrices in the generator is 48. From this fact,\nwe can immediately derive that the fundamental problem of whether a finite set\nof matrices generates a group is also undecidable. We also answer several\nquestion for matrices over different number fields.

IGR J11215-5952 is the\nfirst discovered SFXT displaying periodic outbursts, which are possibly related\nto the orbital period. We performed a Guest Investigator observation with Swift\nthat lasted 20ks and several follow-up Target of Opportunity (ToO)\nobservations, for a total of ~32ks, during the expected \"apastron\" passage\n(defined assuming an orbital period of ~330 days), between 2008 June 16 and\nJuly 4. The characteristics of this \"apastron'' outburst are quite similar to\nthose previously observed during the \"periastron'' outburst of 2007 February 9.\nThe mean spectrum of the bright peaks can be fit with an absorbed power law\nmodel with a photon index of 1 and an absorbing column of 1E22 cm^-2.

At a mean <z> = 5.76, we\ndeduce Omega(C IV)=(4.4+/-2.6)x10^(-9) which implies a drop by a factor of\nabout 3.5 compared to the value at z < 4.7, after accounting for the differing\nsensitivities of different surveys. The observed number of C IV doublets is\nalso lower by a similar factor, compared to expectations for a non-evolving\ncolumn density distribution of absorbers. These results point to a rapid\nbuild-up of intergalactic C IV over a period of only 300 Myr; such a build-up\ncould reflect the accumulation of metals associated with the rising levels of\nstar formation activity from z = 9 indicated by galaxy counts, and/or an\nincreasing degree of ionisation of the intergalactic medium (IGM), following\nthe overlap of ionisation fronts from star-forming regions. If the value of\nOmega(C IV) we derive is typical of the IGM at large, it would imply a\nmetallicity Z(IGM) = 10^(-4) Z(Sun). The early-type stars responsible for\nsynthesising these metals would have emitted only about one Lyman continuum\nphoton per baryon prior to z = 5.8; such a background is insufficient to keep\nthe IGM ionised and we speculate on possible factors which could make up the\nrequired shortfall.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Feb 2009 21:07:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Feb 2009 21:53:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

As a geometry of Minkowski space-time, special\nrelativity can never result in a logical contradiction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Feb 2009 08:31:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 26 Sep 2009 13:59:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-05"}

This physical situation\nprovides the motivation for a systematic gradient expansion of general\nnonlinear elastic constitutive laws that goes beyond the first order\ndisplacement-gradient expansion that is the basis for linear elastic fracture\nmechanics (LEFM). A weakly nonlinear fracture mechanics theory was recently\ndeveloped by considering displacement-gradients up to second order. The theory\npredicts that, at scales within a dynamic lengthscale $\\ell$ from a crack's\ntip, significant $\\log{r}$ displacements and $1/r$ displacement-gradient\ncontributions arise. Whereas in LEFM the $1/r$ singularity generates an\nunbalanced force and must be discarded, we show that this singularity not only\nexists but is {\\em necessary} in the weakly nonlinear theory. The theory\ngenerates no spurious forces and is consistent with the notion of the autonomy\nof the near-tip nonlinear region. The J-integral in the weakly nonlinear theory\nis also shown to be path-independent, taking the same value as the linear\nelastic J-integral. Thus, the weakly nonlinear theory retains the key tenets of\nfracture mechanics, while providing excellent quantitative agreement with\nmeasurements near the tip of single propagating cracks. As $\\ell$ is consistent\nwith lengthscales that appear in crack tip instabilities, we suggest that this\ntheory may serve as a promising starting point for resolving open questions in\nfracture dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Feb 2009 14:28:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Constraints can, however, be obtained by\nstudying the abundances of key elements in bulge stars. The aim of this study\nis to determine the chemical evolution of CNO, and a few other elements in\nstars in the Galactic bulge, and to discuss the sensitivities of the derived\nabundances from molecular lines. High-resolution, near-IR spectra in the H band\nwere recorded using VLT/CRIRES. Due to the high and variable visual extinction\nin the line-of-sight towards the bulge, an analysis in the near-IR is\npreferred. The CNO abundances can all be determined simultaneously from the\nnumerous molecular lines in the wavelength range observed. The three giant\nstars in Baade's window presented here are the first bulge stars observed with\nCRIRES. We have especially determined the CNO abundances, with uncertainties of\nless than 0.20 dex, from CO, CN, and OH lines. Since the systematic\nuncertainties in the derived CNO abundances due to uncertainties in the stellar\nfundamental parameters, notably Teff, are significant, a detailed discussion of\nthe sensitivities of the derived abundances is included. We find good agreement\nbetween near-IR and optically determined O, Ti, Fe, and Si abundances. Two of\nour stars show a solar [C+N/Fe], suggesting that these giants have experienced\nthe first dredge-up and that the oxygen abundance should reflect the original\nabundance of the giants. The two giants fit into the picture, in which there is\nno significant difference between the O abundance in bulge and thick-disk\nstars. Our determination of the S abundances is the first for bulge stars. The\nhigh [S/Fe] values for all the stars indicate a high star-formation rate in an\nearly phase of the bulge evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Feb 2009 14:47:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

It is known that for every rational $\\sigma \\in (0,1)$, on\none hand, there exists sequences with randomness rate $\\sigma$ that can not be\neffectively transformed into a sequence with randomness rate higher than\n$\\sigma$ and, on the other hand, any two independent sequences with randomness\nrate $\\sigma$ can be transformed into a sequence with randomness rate higher\nthan $\\sigma$. We show that the latter result holds even if the two input\nsequences have linear dependency (which, informally speaking, means that all\nprefixes of length $n$ of the two sequences have in common a constant fraction\nof their information). The similar problem is studied for finite strings. It is\nshown that from any two strings with sufficiently large Kolmogorov complexity\nand sufficiently small dependence, one can effectively construct a string that\nis random even conditioned by any one of the input strings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Feb 2009 15:57:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-13"}
