We also highlight\nsome interesting features unique to cold atom superfluids within this intraband\npairing approximation; for instance, the pair field is forced to be uniform in\nspace and the Hartree field vanishes identically.

We extend this model to include\ndependence of the galaxy density on the local values of nabla_i nabla_j phi and\nnabla_i v_j, where phi is the potential and v is the peculiar velocity.

Our analysis accounts for the centrifugal deformation\nof the star, and considers the two-fluid dynamics at linear order in the\nperturbed velocities. Our main focus is on a simple model system where the\ntotal density profile is that of an $n=1$ polytrope. We derive a partially\nanalytic solution for the superfluid analogue of the classical r-mode. This\nsolution is used to analyse the relevance of the vortex mediated mutual\nfriction damping, confirming that this dissipation mechanism is unlikely to\nsuppress the gravitational-wave driven instability in rapidly spinning\nsuperfluid neutron stars. Our calculation of the superfluid r-modes is\nsignificantly simpler than previous approaches, because it decouples the r-mode\nfrom all other inertial modes of the system. This leads to the results being\nclearer, but it also means that we cannot comment on the relevance of potential\navoided crossings (and associated \"resonances\") that may occur for particular\nparameter values. Our analysis of the mutual friction damping differs from\nprevious studies in two important ways. Firstly, we incorporate realistic\npairing gaps which means that the regions of superfluidity in the star's core\nvary with temperature. Secondly, we allow the mutual friction parameters to\ntake the whole range of permissible values rather than focussing on a\nparticular mechanism.

In the radio\ncores of relativistic quasar jets, internal shocks convert a fraction of\nordered bulk kinetic energy into randomized relativistic ions, or in other\nwords cosmic rays. By employing a phenomenologically-motivated jet model, we\nshow that enough 1-100 GeV cosmic rays escape the radio core into the host\ngalaxy to break the Eddington limit in cosmic rays. As a result, hydrostatic\nbalance is lost and a cosmic ray momentum-driven wind develops, expelling gas\nfrom the host galaxy and thus self-limiting the black hole and bulge growth.\nAlthough the interstellar cosmic ray power is much smaller than the quasar\nphoton luminosity, cosmic rays provide a stronger feedback than UV photons,\nsince they exchange momentum with the galactic gas much more efficiently. The\namount of energy released into the host galaxy as cosmic rays, per unit of\nblack hole rest mass energy, is independent of black hole mass. It follows that\nradio-loud jets should be more prevalent in relatively massive systems since\nthey sit in galaxies with relatively deep gravitational potentials. Therefore,\njet-powered cosmic ray feedback not only self-regulates the black hole and\nbulge growth, but also provides an explanation for the lack of radio-loud\nactivity in relatively small galaxies.

So-called \"dry\" mergers between early-type\ngalaxies represent nearly 50% of close pairs with M_* > 3E10 Msun at z~0.5, but\nless than 30% at z~1. This result can be explained by the increasing abundance\nof red, early-type galaxies at these masses.

It centered on a concern, perhaps\nwidely spread, that measurement error adjustment methods can induce positive\nbias in results of epidemiological studies when there is no true association. I\ntrace the possible history of this supposition and test it in a simulation\nstudy of both continuous and binary health outcomes under a classical\nmultiplicative measurement error model. A Bayesian measurement adjustment\nmethod is used. The main conclusion is that adjustment for the presumed\nmeasurement error does not 'induce' positive associations, especially if the\nfocus of the interpretation of the result is taken away from the point\nestimate. This is in line with properties of earlier measurement error\nadjustment methods introduced to epidemiologists in the 1990s. An heuristic\nargument is provided to support the generalizability of this observation in the\nBayesian framework. I find that when there is no true association, positive\nbias can only be induced by indefensible manipulation of the priors, such that\nthey dominate the data. The misconception about bias induced by measurement\nerror adjustment should be more clearly explained during the training of\nepidemiologists to ensure the appropriate (and wider) use of measurement error\ncorrection procedures. The simple message that can be derived from this paper\nis: 'Do not focus on point estimates, but mind the gap between boundaries that\nreflect variability in the estimate'.

The reduced models are obtained using an\napproximate balanced truncation method that retains the most controllable and\nobservable modes of the system. The original method is valid only for stable\nlinear systems, and we present an extension to unstable linear systems. The\ndynamics on the unstable subspace are represented by projecting the original\nequations onto the global unstable eigenmodes, assumed to be small in number. A\nsnapshot-based algorithm is developed, using approximate balanced truncation,\nfor obtaining a reduced-order model of the dynamics on the stable subspace. The\nproposed algorithm is used to study feedback control of 2-D flow over a flat\nplate at a low Reynolds number and at large angles of attack, where the natural\nflow is vortex shedding, though there also exists an unstable steady state. For\ncontrol design, we derive reduced-order models valid in the neighborhood of\nthis unstable steady state. The actuation is modeled as a localized body force\nnear the leading edge of the flat plate, and the sensors are two velocity\nmeasurements in the near-wake of the plate. A reduced-order Kalman filter is\ndeveloped based on these models and is shown to accurately reconstruct the flow\nfield from the sensor measurements, and the resulting estimator-based control\nis shown to stabilize the unstable steady state. For small perturbations of the\nsteady state, the model accurately predicts the response of the full\nsimulation. Furthermore, the resulting controller is even able to suppress the\nstable periodic vortex shedding, where the nonlinear effects are strong, thus\nimplying a large domain of attraction of the stabilized steady state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Feb 2009 00:45:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

In this article, squared eigenfunctions are derived for the\nSasa-Satsuma equation whose spectral operator is a $3\\times 3$ system, while\nits linearized operator is a $2\\times 2$ system. It is shown that these squared\neigenfunctions are sums of two terms, where each term is a product of a Jost\nfunction and an adjoint Jost function. The procedure of this derivation\nconsists of two steps: first is to calculate the variations of the potentials\nvia variations of the scattering data by the Riemann-Hilbert method. The second\none is to calculate the variations of the scattering data via the variations of\nthe potentials through elementary calculations. While this procedure has been\nused before on other integrable equations, it is shown here, for the first\ntime, that for a general integrable equation, the functions appearing in these\nvariation relations are precisely the squared eigenfunctions and adjoint\nsquared eigenfunctions satisfying respectively the linearized equation and the\nadjoint linearized equation of the integrable system. This proof clarifies this\nprocedure and provides a unified explanation for previous results of squared\neigenfunctions on individual integrable equations. This procedure uses\nprimarily the spectral operator of the Lax pair. Thus two equations in the same\nintegrable hierarchy will share the same squared eigenfunctions (except for a\ntime-dependent factor). In the Appendix, the squared eigenfunctions are\npresented for the Manakov equations whose spectral operator is closely related\nto that of the Sasa-Satsuma equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Feb 2009 01:43:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The lemma also enables a broad\ntopological classification of fading MARCs into one of three types.

So, by using the numerical and analytical solutions of\nthe differential equation for the radiation, we construct the energy spectra\nfor different masses of the dipole-NS. These spectra show that, in relatively\nlow angular momentum l, the effect of the gravitational mass is very\nsignificant in suppressing the relativistic enhancement factor, which had been\nfound [27, 28, 32], by two to three orders of magnitude, as the mass changes\nfrom 0.5 solar mass to 3 solar masses. It is an indication that most of the\nangular momentum of the NS is retained as rotational kinetic energy instead of\nbeing radiated as an electromagnetic energy. Also, the suppressing in radiation\nenergy is more or less independent of the angular momentum, and the high\nrotational velocity. We also found that electromagnetic energy is proportional\nto square of sin(inclination angle the obliquity) which is similar to the\nclassical behavior. However, in the very high angular momentum, the whole\nradiation suppresses and the effect of mass is neglected.

We have adopted a weak transition potential\nincluding the exchange of the complete octets of pseudoscalar and vector mesons\nas well as a residual strong interaction modeled on the Bonn potential. The\nintroduction of exchange terms turns out to reduce the two--nucleon induced\nnon--mesonic rate by 18% and, jointly with an increase in the one--nucleon\ninduced rate by the same magnitude, reveals to be significant for an accurate\ndetermination of the full set of hypernuclear non--mesonic decay widths in\ntheoretical and experimental analyses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Feb 2009 13:42:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-17"}
