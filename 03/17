The ME polarization coefficient of the heterostructures\ninvolving Terfenol-D substrates and compressively strained lead zirconate\ntitanate (PZT) films, which stabilize in the out-of-plane polarization state,\nis found to be comparable to that of bulk PZT/Terfenol-D laminate composites.\nAt the same time, the ME voltage coefficient reaches a giant value of 50 V/(cm\nOe), which greatly exceeds the maximum observed static ME coefficients of bulk\ncomposites. This remarkable feature is explained by a favorable combination of\nconsiderable strain sensitivity of polarization and a low electric permittivity\nin compressively strained PZT films. The theory also predicts a further\ndramatic increase of ME coefficients at the strain-induced transitions between\ndifferent ferroelectric phases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2009 16:09:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Mar 2009 11:53:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-18"}

Specifically, we would like\nto answer: Could dry mergers lead to metallicity gradients as observed in\nelliptical galaxies in the local Universe? Do dry mergers always lead to a\nflattening of the initial (i.e., pre-merger) gradient? From this modeling, we\nconclude that: The ratio of the remnant and the initial galaxy slopes span a\nwide range of values, up to values greater than 1 (with values greater than one\nresulting only when companions have gradients twice the progenitor). For a\nmerger between two ellipticals having identical initial metallicity slopes\n(i.e., equal companion and galaxy slopes), the metallicity profile of the\nremnant flattens, with a final gradient about 0.6 times the initial one.\nEllipticals can maintain their original pre-merger metallicity gradient if the\ncompanion slope is sufficiently steep. The amount of flattening neither depends\non the characteristics of the orbit of the progenitors or on their initial\nconcentration.

In so doing,\nthe hypothesis that there may be an anomalous enstrophy sink at small scales\nand an anomalous energy sink at large scales emerges as a consequence of the\nfusion rules hypothesis. More broadly, we illustrate the significance of\nviewing inertial ranges as multi-dimensional regions where the fully unfused\ngeneralized structure functions of the velocity field are self-similar, by\nconsidering, in this paper, the simplified projection of such regions in a\ntwo-dimensional space, involving a small scale $r$ and a large scale $R$, which\nwe call, in this paper, the $(r, R)$-plane. We see, for example, that the\nlogarithmic correction in the enstrophy cascade, under standard molecular\ndissipation, plays an essential role in inflating the inertial range in the\n$(r, R)$ plane to ensure the possibility of local interactions.

A magnetic\ntransition visible in ac-susceptibility shifts down under pressure and the\nresistive anomaly typical for a spin density wave (SDW) antiferromagnetic\ntransition develops near the susceptibility anomaly. Tc determined by the\nappearance of a diamagnetic response in susceptibility, increases linearly\nunder pressure at a rate dTc/dP = 3.5 K/GPa.

For the first time in the history of the topic, we use\naccurate mass models for the Fornax dwarf, obtained through Jeans modelling of\nthe recently published line of sight velocity dispersion data, and we are also\nnot resigned to circular orbits for the globular clusters. Previously conceived\nproblems stem from fixing the starting distances of the globulars to be less\nthan half the tidal radius. We relax this constraint since there is absolutely\nno evidence for it and show that the dark matter paradigm, with either cusped\nor cored dark matter profiles, has no trouble sustaining the orbits of the two\nleast massive globular clusters for a Hubble time almost regardless of their\ninitial distance from Fornax. The three most massive globulars can remain in\norbit as long as their starting distances are marginally outside the tidal\nradius. The outlook for modified Newtonian dynamics is also not nearly as bleak\nas previously reported. Although dynamical friction inside the tidal radius is\nfar stronger in MOND, outside dynamical friction is negligible due to the\nabsence of stars. This allows highly radial orbits to survive, but more\nimportantly circular orbits at distances more than 85% of Fornax's tidal radius\nto survive indefinitely. The probability of the globular clusters being on\ncircular orbits at this distance compared with their current projected\ndistances is discussed and shown to be plausible. Finally, if we ignore the\npresence of the most massive globular (giving it a large line of sight\ndistance) we demonstrate that the remaining four globulars can survive within\nthe tidal radius for the Hubble time with perfectly sensible orbits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2009 23:26:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

To be useful in a real setting, such a language should allow one\nto express realistic policies which may involve parameter quantification and\nquantitative or statistical patterns.

To describe the radio synchrotron emission we use a model that\ncouples a semianalytic description of nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration\nwith self-similar solutions for the hydrodynamics of the supernova expansion.\nThe synchrotron emission, which is assumed to be produced by relativistic\nelectrons propagating in the postshock plasma, is worked out from radiative\ntransfer calculations that include the process of synchrotron self-absorption.\nThe model is applied to explain the morphology of the radio emission deduced\nfrom high-resolution VLBI imaging observations and the measured time evolution\nof the total flux density at six frequencies. Both the light curves and the\nmorphology of the radio emission indicate that the magnetic field was strongly\namplified in the blast wave region shortly after the explosion, possibly via\nthe nonresonant regime of the cosmic-ray streaming instability operating in the\nshock precursor. The turbulent magnetic field was not damped behind the shock\nbut carried along by the plasma flow in the downstream region. Cosmic-ray\nprotons were efficiently produced by diffusive shock acceleration at the blast\nwave. We find that during the first ~8.5 years after the explosion, about 19%\nof the total energy processed by the forward shock was converted to cosmic-ray\nenergy. However, the shock remained weakly modified by the cosmic-ray pressure.\nThe high magnetic field amplification implies that protons were rapidly\naccelerated to energies well above 1 PeV. The results obtained for this\nsupernova support the scenario that massive stars exploding into their former\nstellar wind are a major source of high-energy Galactic cosmic rays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Mar 2009 11:29:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The result is again a regular multiplier\nHopf algebra.

It is\ntherefore conceivable that also neural information processing operates close to\ncriticality. This is further supported by the observation of power-law\ndistributions, which are a hallmark of phase transitions. An important open\nquestion is how neural networks could remain close to a critical point while\nundergoing a continual change in the course of development, adaptation,\nlearning, and more. An influential contribution was made by Bornholdt and\nRohlf, introducing a generic mechanism of robust self-organized criticality in\nadaptive networks. Here, we address the question whether this mechanism is\nrelevant for real neural networks. We show in a realistic model that\nspike-time-dependent synaptic plasticity can self-organize neural networks\nrobustly toward criticality. Our model reproduces several empirical\nobservations and makes testable predictions on the distribution of synaptic\nstrength, relating them to the critical state of the network. These results\nsuggest that the interplay between dynamics and topology may be essential for\nneural information processing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Mar 2009 15:51:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 May 2010 08:55:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}
