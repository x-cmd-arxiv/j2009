In this\narticle we describe simulations of full QCD using the improved staggered quark\nformalism, ``asqtad'' fermions. These simulations were carried out with two\ndegenerate flavors of light quarks (up and down) and with one heavier flavor,\nthe strange quark. Several light quark masses, down to about 3 times the\nphysical light quark mass, and six lattice spacings have been used. These\nenable controlled continuum and chiral extrapolations of many low energy QCD\nobservables. We review the improved staggered formalism, emphasizing both\nadvantages and drawbacks. In particular, we review the procedure for removing\nunwanted staggered species in the continuum limit. We then describe the asqtad\nlattice ensembles created by the MILC Collaboration. All MILC lattice ensembles\nare publicly available, and they have been used extensively by a number of\nlattice gauge theory groups. We review physics results obtained with them, and\ndiscuss the impact of these results on phenomenology. Topics include the heavy\nquark potential, spectrum of light hadrons, quark masses, decay constant of\nlight and heavy-light pseudoscalar mesons, semileptonic form factors, nucleon\nstructure, scattering lengths and more. We conclude with a brief look at highly\npromising future prospects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2009 15:26:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 12 Sep 2009 17:17:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-13"}

Extending our previous work on ZrSiO4, the Gibbs free\nenergy has been calculated using a transferable interatomic potential in\nvarious phases over a range of P and T. Due to an interesting interplay between\nthe vibrational entropy and atomic packing, the zircon (body centered\ntetragonal, I41/amd), scheelite (body centered tetragonal, I41/a) and huttonite\n(monoclinic, P21/n) phases occur at different P and T. It is shown that for\nThSiO4 at high P, the huttonite and scheelite phases are favored at high and\nlow T respectively. However, for both USiO4 and HfSiO4 the huttonite phase is\ndynamically unstable and the scheelite phase is stable as the high pressure\nphase. In fact, the calculations reveal that the stability of the huttonite\nphase is determined by the ionic size of the M-atom; this phase is unstable for\nthe silicate with the smaller Hf and U ions and stable with the larger Th ion.\nThe calculated phase diagrams are in fair agreement with the reported\nexperimental observations. The calculated structures, phonon spectra, and\nvarious thermodynamic properties also fairly well reproduce the available\nexperimental data. The low-energy phonons in the huttonite phase that\ncontribute to its large vibrational entropy are found to involve librational\nmotion of the silicate tetrahedral units.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Mar 2009 20:43:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-27"}

Certain limitations of centralized geographic indexes favor\npeer-to-peer organization of the information, which, in addition to avoiding\nperformance bottleneck, allows autonomy over local information. Peer-to-peer\nsystems for geographic or multidimensional range queries built on existing DHTs\nsuffer from the inaccuracy in linearization of the multidimensional space.\nOther overlay structures that are based on hierarchical partitioning of the\nsearch space are not scalable because they use special super-peers to represent\nthe nodes in the hierarchy. GeoP2P partitions the search space hierarchically,\nmaintains the overlay structure and performs the routing without the need of\nany super-peers. Although similar fully-decentralized overlays have been\npreviously proposed, they lack the ability to dynamically grow and retract the\npartition hierarchy when the number of peers change. GeoP2P provides such\nadaptive features with minimum perturbation of the system state. Such\nadaptation makes both the routing delay and the state size of each peer\nlogarithmic to the total number of peers, irrespective of the size of the\nmultidimensional space. Our analysis also reveals that the overlay structure\nand the routing algorithm are generic and independent of several aspects of the\npartitioning hierarchy, such as the geometric shape of the zones or the\ndimensionality of the search space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Mar 2009 21:39:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-24"}

On Earth and Mars, water ice forms ice sheets, ice caps and\nglaciers at the surface, which show glacial flow under their own weight. By\ncontrast, water ice is a major constituent of the bulk volume of the icy\nsatellites in the outer solar system, and ice flow can occur as thermal\nconvection. The rheology of polycrystalline aggregates of ordinary, hexagonal\nice Ih is described by a power law, different forms of which are discussed. The\ntemperature dependence of the ice viscosity follows an Arrhenius law.\nTherefore, the flow of ice in a planetary environment constitutes a\nthermo-mechanically coupled problem; its model equations are obtained by\ninserting the flow law and the thermodynamic material equations in the balance\nlaws of mass, momentum and energy. As an example of gravity-driven flow, the\npolar caps of Mars are discussed. For the north-polar cap, large-scale flow\nvelocities of the order of 0.1...1 mm/a are likely, locally enhanced by a\nfactor ten or more in the vicinity of surface scarps/troughs. By contrast, the\ncolder south-polar cap is expected to be almost stagnant. Tidally heated\nconvection is discussed for the example of the icy crust of Europa, where a\ntwo-dimensional model predicts the formation of an upper, conductive lid and a\nlower, convective layer with flow velocities of the order of 100 mm/a. Very\nlittle is known about the fluid-dynamical relevance of high-pressure phases of\nwater ice as well as ices made up of other materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2009 02:05:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-22"}

The near IR light curve and an\nextensive set of spectra are presented, lines identified and the general\ncharacteristics of the spectra discussed. Analysis of the HI line profiles show\nthe presence of broad wings on both flanks of a strong central component\nindicating the presence of a bipolar velocity flow in the ejecta. Such a flow\nis kinematically consistent with the bipolar structure that the object displays\nin high-resolution spatial images. We discuss the behaviour and origin of the\nFe II lines at 1.6872 and 1.7414 micron and show that Lyman alpha and Lyman\ncontinuum fluorescence are viable mechanisms to excite these lines. We draw\nupon the result, that collisional excitation can also contribute in exciting\nand significantly enhancing the strength of these Fe II lines, to propose that\nthese lines originate from a site of high particle density.

The recent 3-D thickness map of the outer HI disk from\nthe all sky 21-cm line LAB survey, gives us a unique opportunity to investigate\nthe structure of the dark matter halo of Milky Way in great detail. A striking\nfeature of this new survey is the North-South asymmetry in the thickness map of\nthe atomic hydrogen gas.

Amongst the\nnon-axisymmetric models, it is shown that a purely lopsided (m=1, first\nharmonic) dark matter halo with reasonable HI velocity dispersion fails to\nexplain the North-South asymmetry satisfactorily.

Complete description of irreducible components of the\nrepresentation variety $mod (R,n)$, which we call a Jordan variety' is given\nfor any dimension $n$.

As measured from the [3.6] - [4.5] color excesses, we find average\nstellar mass-loss rates ranging from 3.1E-7 - 6.6E-6 solar masses per year, and\nintegrated galaxy mass-loss rates ranging from 4.4E-5 - 1.4E-3 solar masses per\nyear. The integrated mass-loss rate is sufficient to sustain the current star\nformation rate in only LGS 3 and DDO 210, requiring either significant\nnon-dusty mass loss or gas accretion in Phoenix, Leo A, Pegasus dIrr, Sextans\nA, WLM, and IC 1613 if they are to maintain their status as gas-rich galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2009 15:38:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}
