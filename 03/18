First, some iron meteorites, eucrites, and angrites older than\nthe chondrules or even than the CAI have been found. Second, iron meteorites\ncould be debris of early disrupted differentiated planetesimals, scattered from\nthe terrestrial planet region to the Main Belt. Finally, chondrules contain\nfragments of planetesimal material.\n  2) Earth and Moon: An equilibration mechanism explains the identical Oxygen\nisotopic composition of the Earth and the Moon. In addition, it has been shown\nthat the Earth and the Moon mantles have the same 182^W anomaly, in contrast to\nwhat was believed before. Consequently, the Moon forming impact should have\noccurred after the extinction of the 182Hf radioactivity, about 60 Myr after\nSolar System formation. This new datation is in agreement with new N-body\nnumerical simulations of the last phase of terrestrial planets formation, in\nwhich giant impacts occur during about 100 Myr.\n  3) Giant planets and Nice model: The migration of the giant planets in the\nprotoplanetary disc can be prevented if the planets are in resonance, close to\neach other. In the ``Nice model'', the 4 outer planets of the Solar System were\nin a compact configuration after the dissipation of gaseous disc. A few hundred\nmillion years later, a global instability drives the planets on their present\norbits, producing the Late Heavy Bombardment. In this frame, a lot of\ncharacteristics of our Solar System can be explained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Mar 2009 17:29:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Here we showcase\nsuch {\\it decisive} strong single pulses from 10 pulsars observed with the\nGMRT, showing extremely high linear polarization with the position angle\nfollowing locally the mean position angle traverse. These pulses, which are\nrelatively free from depolarization, must consist of exclusively single\npolarization mode. We associate this mode with the extraordinary wave excited\nby the coherent curvature radiation. This crucial observational signature\nenables us to argue, for the first time, in favor of the coherent curvature\nemission mechanism, excluding the maser mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Mar 2009 19:08:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

On the other hand, the numerical\nstudies of such flows have been focussed so far mainly on the lowest possible\nrange of Lorentz factors $\\Gamma,$ specifically, on the regime $1\\leq \\Gamma\n\\leq 5.$ Therefore, relativistic flows with high $\\Gamma-$factors have poorly\nstudied, as most numerical methods are found to encounter severe numerical\ndifficulties or even become numerically unstable for $\\Gamma \\gg 1. In this\npaper we present an implicit numerical advection scheme for modeling the\npropagation of relativistic plasmas with shocks, discuss its consistency with\nrespect to both the internal and total energy formulation in general\nrelativity. Using the total energy formulation, the scheme is found to be\nviable for modeling moving shocks with moderate Lorentz factors, though with\nrelatively small Courant numbers. In the limit of high Lorentz factors, the\ninternal energy formulation in combination with a fine-tuned artificial\nviscosity is much more robust and efficient.

This is a prototypical case of a source that is\nextremely obscured by dust, for which it is practically impossible to derive a\nspectroscopic redshift in the optical/near-IR. Under the hypothesis that GN10\nis part of a proto-cluster structure previously identified at z~4.05 in the\nsame field, we searched for CO[4-3] at 91.4 GHz with the IRAM Plateau de Bure\nInterferometer, and successfully detected a line.

GCs\nare therefore expected to host large numbers of MSPs. This is also confirmed\nobservationally. The MSPs continuously inject relativistic electrons into the\nambient region beyond their light cylinders, and these relativistic particles\nproduce unpulsed radiation via the synchrotron and inverse Compton (IC)\nprocesses. It is thus possible, in the context of General Relativistic (GR)\nframe-dragging MSP models, to predict unpulsed very high energy radiation\nexpected from nearby GCs. We use a period-derivative cleaned sample of MSPs in\n47 Tucanae, where the effects of the cluster potential on the individual period\nderivatives have been removed. Using a Monte Carlo process to include effects\nof pulsar geometry, we obtain average injection spectra (with relatively small\nerrors) of particles leaving the MSPs.

Second-order magnetic field\nstatistics like the power spectrum cannot always distinguish between magnetic\nfields with essentially different spatial structure. Synchrotron polarimetry\nnaturally allows certain 4th-order magnetic field statistics to be inferred\nfrom observational data, which lifts this degeneracy and can thereby help us\ngain a better picture of the structure of the cosmic fields and test\ntheoretical scenarios describing magnetic turbulence.

In both cases the tension force power spectrum is\nmeasurable; in the latter case, the magnetic power spectrum may also be\nobtainable. The method is exact in the idealized case of a homogeneous\nrelativistic-electron distribution that has a power-law energy spectrum with a\nspectral index p=3, and assumes statistical isotropy of the turbulent field. We\ncarry out tests of our method using synthetic data generated from numerically\nsimulated magnetic fields.

A new empirical hydration\nfree energy component based on a procedure to locate and score hydration sites\non the solute surface is introduced to model first solvation shell effects,\nsuch as hydrogen bonding, which are poorly described by continuum dielectric\nmodels. This new component is added to the Generalized Born and non-polar AGBNP\nmodels which have been improved with respect to the description of the solute\nvolume description.

Gas has a strong impact on the non-Gaussian shapes of the\nline-of-sight velocity distributions (LOSVDs) of the merger remnant, owing to\nthe embedded disk that forms out of the gas that retains its angular momentum\nduring the merger, and the strong central mass concentration from the gas that\nfalls to the center. The deviations from Gaussianity are parametrized by the\nGauss-Hermite moments h_3 and h_4, which are related to the skewness and\nkurtosis of the LOSVDs. We quantify the dependence of the (h_3,h_4)-v/sigma\nrelations on the initial gas fraction of the progenitor disks in 1:1 mergers,\nusing Gadget-2 simulations including star formation, radiative cooling, and\nfeedback from supernovae and AGN. For gas fractions f_gas < ~15% the overall\ncorrelation between h_3 and v/sigma is weak, consisting of a flat negatively\ncorrelated component arising from edge-on viewing angles plus a steep\npositively correlated part from face-on projections. The spread in v/sigma\nvalues decreases toward high positive h_4, and there is a trend toward lower\nh_4 as the gas fraction increases from 0 to 15%. For f_gas > ~20% the (h_3,4)-\nv/sigma distributions look quite different - there is a tight negative h_3-\nv/sigma correlation, and a wide spread in v/sigma values at all h_4, in better\nagreement with observations. Re-mergers of the high-f_gas remnants (dry\nmergers) produce slowly rotating systems with nearly Gaussian LOSVDs.

An\niterative solution of these equations generally diverges if $\\kappa$ is held\nfixed, but converges with other choices. We investigate the mathematical reason\nfor this convergence/divergence by starting the iteration from an approximation\nthat is perturbatively different from the actual solution. A cycle of iteration\nis then treated as a linear \"updating\" operator, and the properties of the\nlinear operator, especially its spectrum, determine the convergence properties.\nFor simplicity, we confine ourselves to spherically symmetric models in which\nwe analyze updating operators both in the finite dimensional space\ncorresponding to a finite difference representation of the problem, and in the\ncontinuum, and we find that the fixed-$\\kappa$ operator is self-adjoint and\ngenerally has an eigenvalue greater than unity; in the particularly important\ncase of a polytropic equation of state with index greater than unity, we prove\nthat there must be such an eigenvalue.

In the model which is improved\nfrom Li et al. 2000, the radial expansion of the thickness is accounted for,\nbut we retain the dependence on the beta velocity law, stellar occultation\neffects. We again search for parameters that can yield results consistent with\nobservations in regards to the mean polarization, the ratio of polarimetric to\nphotometric variability, and the volume filling factor. Clump generation and\nspatial distribution are randomized by the Monte Carlo method so as to produce\nclumps which are, in the mean, distributed uniformly in space and have time\nintervals with a Gaussian distribution. The generated clumps move radially\noutward with a velocity law determined by a beta index, and the angular size of\nthe clumps is assumed to keep fixed. By fitting the observational results and\nthe volume filling factor, the clump velocity law index beta and clump ejection\nrate are inferred, and are found to be well constrained. In addition, the\nsubpeak features on broad emission lines seem to support the clump ejection\nrate. Meanwhile, the fraction of the total mass loss rate that is contained in\nthe clumps is obtained by fitting the observed polarization. We conclude that\nthis picture for the clump properties produces a valuable diagnostic of WR wind\nstructure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2009 03:49:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

However, in\ncalculating the afterglows, usually only the emission from the forward jet is\nconsidered. Here we present a detailed numerical study on the afterglow from\nthe receding jet. Our calculation is based on a generic dynamical description,\nand includes some delicate ingredients such as the effect of the equal arrival\ntime surface. It is found that the emission from the receding jet is generally\nrather weak. In radio bands, it usually peaks at a time of $t \\geq 1000$ d,\nwith the peak flux nearly 4 orders of magnitude lower than the peak flux of the\nforward jet. Also, it usually manifests as a short plateau in the total\nafterglow light curve, but not as an obvious rebrightening as once expected. In\noptical bands, the contribution from the receding jet is even weaker, with the\npeak flux being $\\sim 8$ orders of magnitude lower than the peak flux of the\nforward jet. We thus argue that the emission from the receding jet is very\ndifficult to detect. However, in some special cases, i.e., when the\ncircum-burst medium density is very high, or if the parameters of the receding\njet is quite different from those of the forward jet, the emission from the\nreceding jet can be significantly enhanced and may still emerge as a marked\nrebrightening. We suggest that the search for receding jet emission should\nmostly concentrate on nearby gamma-ray bursts, and the observation campaign\nshould last for at least several hundred days for each event.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2009 10:00:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2009 05:11:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2009 09:07:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

We\nintroduce a new real-space estimator for one of the most used cosmological\nstatistics, the 2-point correlation function, that weights by the PDF of\nindividual photometric objects in a manner that is optimal when Poisson\nstatistics dominate. As our estimator does not bin based on the PDF peak it\nsubstantially enhances the clustering signal by usefully incorporating\ninformation from all photometric objects that overlap the redshift bin of\ninterest.

This field addresses a broad range of problems of significant\npractical interest, namely, the recovery of a data matrix from what appears to\nbe incomplete, and perhaps even corrupted, information. In its simplest form,\nthe problem is to recover a matrix from a small sample of its entries, and\ncomes up in many areas of science and engineering including collaborative\nfiltering, machine learning, control, remote sensing, and computer vision to\nname a few.\n  This paper surveys the novel literature on matrix completion, which shows\nthat under some suitable conditions, one can recover an unknown low-rank matrix\nfrom a nearly minimal set of entries by solving a simple convex optimization\nproblem, namely, nuclear-norm minimization subject to data constraints.\nFurther, this paper introduces novel results showing that matrix completion is\nprovably accurate even when the few observed entries are corrupted with a small\namount of noise. A typical result is that one can recover an unknown n x n\nmatrix of low rank r from just about nr log^2 n noisy samples with an error\nwhich is proportional to the noise level. We present numerical results which\ncomplement our quantitative analysis and show that, in practice, nuclear norm\nminimization accurately fills in the many missing entries of large low-rank\nmatrices from just a few noisy samples. Some analogies between matrix\ncompletion and compressed sensing are discussed throughout.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2009 10:59:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-19"}

The FOCES@CAHA spectral\nrange is used to determine spectral classification and derive vsini and Vrad.\nThe Li abundance is measured to estimate the age. The BVRIJHKs bands are used\nto construct the SED. The variations of our BV fluxes and Teff are used to\ninfer the presence of photospheric spots and observe their behavior over time.\nThe chromospheric activity is studied applying the spectral subtraction\ntechnique to Halpha, CaII H&K, Heps, and CaII IRT lines. We find SAO51891 to be\na young K0-1V star with Li abundance close to the Pleiades upper envelope,\nconfirming its youth (~100 Myr), also inferred from its kinematical membership\nto the Local Association. We detect no IR excess from SED analysis, and\nrotational modulation of luminosity, Teff, CaII, and Heps total fluxes. A spot\nmodel with two active regions, ~240 K cooler than the surrounding photosphere,\nfits our light/Teff curves, and reproduces the small-amplitude Vrad variations.\nThe anti-correlation of light curves and chromospheric diagnostics indicates\nplages spatially associated with spots. The large amplitude observed in the\nHeps-flux curve suggests that this line is very sensitive to the plage\npresence. Finally, SAO51891 is a young active star, lacking significant amounts\nof circumstellar dust or any evidence for low mass companions. The spots turn\nout to be larger and warmer than those in less active MS stars. The Vrad\nvariation produced by spots has an amplitude comparable with those induced by\nJupiter-mass planets orbiting close to the star. SAO51891 is a good example of\nstar where the detection of planets may be hampered by the high activity level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2009 11:54:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

It is related to\nthe process of intermolecular Coulombic decay (ICD). In addition, we include\nthe interaction-induced motion of the atoms and the effect of multi-particle\nsystems in this work. We find that the probability for this ionization\nmechanism can be increased in many-particle systems featuring attractive or\nrepulsive van der Waals interactions.

F is a function of some set of\nindependent, currently unknown variables V, with O being a linear, partial\ndifferential operator in those variables. The operator is assumed to be\ninvariant under a group of transformations of the Vs, homomorphic to the direct\nproduct of the inhomogeneous Lorentz group and the internal symmetry group. In\nsuch a theory, a state vector, denoted by a ket with group-theoretic labels,\nwould represent a function of the independent variables. In addition to\nexplaining the group representational structure of quantum mechanics, an\nunderlying theory offers insight into gauge theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2009 13:39:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-19"}

Yet, the only agreement seems to be that\nHTSC is an example of a strongly correlated material where Coulomb repulsion\nplays a major role. This manuscript proposes a model based on a Feshbach\nresonance pairing mechanism and competing orders. An initial BCS-type\nsuperconductivity at high doping is suppressed in the two particle channel by a\nlocalized preformed pair (PP) [1] (circular density wave) creating a quantum\ncritical point (QCP). As doping continues to diminish, the PP then participates\nin a Feshbach resonance complex that creates a new electron (hole) pair that\ndelocalizes and constitutes HTSC and the characteristic dome [2]. The resonant\nnature of the new pair contributes to its short coherence length. The model we\npropose also suggests an explanation (and necessity) for an experimentally\nobserved correlated lattice that could restrict energy dissipation to enable\nthe resonant Cooper pair to move over several correlation lengths, or\nessentially free. The PP density wave is responsible for the pseudogap as it\nappears as a localized superconductor since its density of states and\nquasiparticle spectrum are similar to those of a superconductor\n(Peierls-Frolich theory), but with no phase coherence between the PP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2009 13:49:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Apr 2009 14:24:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

There are tight constraints on the abundance of\nPBHs formed due to their gravitational effects and the consequences of their\nevaporation. These abundance constraints can be used to constrain the\nprimordial power spectrum, and hence models of inflation, on scales far smaller\nthan those probed by cosmological observations. We compile, and where relevant\nupdate, the constraints on the abundance of PBHs before calculating the\nconstraints on the curvature perturbation, taking into account the growth of\ndensity perturbations prior to horizon entry. We consider two simple\nparameterizations of the curvature perturbation spectrum on the scale of\ninterest: constant and power-law. The constraints from PBHs on the amplitude of\nthe power spectrum are typically in the range 10^{-2}-10^{-1} with some scale\ndependence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2009 15:31:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2009 11:31:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-30"}

Taking the point of view that this is just an efficient parametrization\nof the non-perturbative dynamics of strong interactions, we discuss on a\nqualitative level an alternative possibility for a simpler 5-dimensional\nparametrization of main phenomena in the low-energy QCD. We propose to\ninterpret the effect of chiral symmetry breaking as an effective appearance of\ncompactified extra dimension with the radius of the order of inverse scale of\nchiral symmetry breaking. Following some heuristic arguments two dual scenarios\nfor the emergence of the excited light mesons are introduced: In the first\nscenario, the meson resonances are interpreted as the effects of Kaluza-Klein\nexcitations of quarks inside mesons, in the second one, as the formation of\ngluon strings wound around the compactified dimension an appropriate number of\ntimes. Matching of these scenarios permits to express the slope of radial Regge\ntrajectories through the order parameters of the chiral symmetry breaking, with\nthe compactification radius being excluded. This example shows qualitatively\nthat the extra dimension may play an auxiliary role providing a short way for\nderiving new relations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2009 15:36:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-22"}

More\nspecifically, this work starts dealing with: (i) the maximal hermitian (but not\nselfadjoint) Time operator in non-relativistic quantum mechanics and in quantum\nelectrodynamics; and with: (ii) the problem of the four-position and\nfour-momentum operators, each one with its hermitian and anti-hermitian parts,\nfor relativistic spin-zero particles. Afterwards, other physically important\napplications of non-selfadjoint (and even non-hermitian) operators are\ndiscussed: In particular, (iii) we reanalyze in detail the interesting\npossibility of associating quasi-hermitian Hamiltonians with (decaying)\nunstable states in nuclear physics. Finally, we briefly mention the cases of\nquantum dissipation, as well as of the nuclear optical potential.
