Most fMRI analyses via GLM\nproceed in a massively univariate fashion where the same design matrix is used\nfor analyzing data from each voxel. A major limitation of this approach is the\nlocally varying nature of signals of interest as well as associated confounds.\nThis local variability results in a potentially large bias and uncontrolled\nincrease in variance for the contrast of interest. The main contributions of\nthis paper are two fold (1) We develop a statistical framework called SMART\nthat enables estimation of an optimal design matrix while explicitly\ncontrolling the bias variance decomposition over a set of potential design\nmatrices and (2) We develop and validate a numerical algorithm for computing\noptimal design matrices for general fMRI data sets. The implications of this\nframework include the ability to match optimally the magnitude of underlying\nsignals to their true magnitudes while also matching the \"null\" signals to zero\nsize thereby optimizing both the sensitivity and specificity of signal\ndetection. By enabling the capture of multiple profiles of interest using a\nsingle contrast (as opposed to an F-test) in a way that optimizes for both bias\nand variance enables the passing of first level parameter estimates and their\nvariances to the higher level for group analysis which is not possible using\nF-tests. We demonstrate the application of this approach to in vivo\npharmacological fMRI data capturing the acute response to a drug infusion, to\ntask-evoked, block design fMRI and to the estimation of a haemodynamic response\nfunction (HRF) response in event-related fMRI. Our framework is quite general\nand has potentially wide applicability to a variety of disciplines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2009 19:23:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-17"}

This issue has\nimplications for interpreting bar and spiral fractions at high redshift.\nAnalysis of previous samples suggested that such a correlation exists in the\nnear-infrared, where effects of extinction and star formation are less\nimportant. However, the earlier samples had only a few excessively strong bars.\nOur new sample largely confirms our previous studies, but still any correlation\nis relatively weak.

Examples of such problems\ninclude partial differential equations (in particular, the Schrodinger\nequation) very high dimensional integration, approximation, continuous\noptimization, and path integration. Because the computer has only partial\ninformation about the continuous mathematical problem adversary arguments at\nthe information level often lead to tight complexity bounds.

Here we\ncompare the radial stellar density profiles and the number density of a sample\nof massive galaxies at z ~ 2.3 to nearby massive elliptical galaxies. We\nconfirm that the average stellar densities of the z ~ 2.3 galaxies within the\neffective radius, rho(<r_e), are two orders of magnitude higher than those of\nlocal elliptical galaxies of the same stellar mass. However, we also find that\nthe densities measured within a constant physical radius of 1 kpc, rho(<1 kpc),\nare higher by a factor of 2-3 only. This suggests that inside-out growth\nscenarios are plausible, in which the compact high redshift galaxies make up\nthe centers of normal nearby ellipticals. The compact galaxies are common at\nhigh redshift, which enables us to further constrain their evolution by\nrequiring that the number density of their descendants does not exceed\nconstraints imposed by the z=0 galaxy mass function. We infer that size growth\nmust be efficient, with (r_{1+2}/r_1) ~ (M_{1+2}/M_1)^2.

We then confront our results with\nobservations of OB stars. A stellar evolution code is used to compute a grid of\nmassive star models at different metallicities. In these models, the mixing\nlength theory is used to characterize the envelope convection zones. We find\nthe iron convection zone (FeCZ) to be more prominent for lower surface gravity,\nhigher luminosity and higher initial metallicity. It is absent for luminosities\nbelow about $10^{3.2}\\Lsun$, $10^{3.9}\\Lsun$, and $10^{4.2}$\\Lsun$ for the\nGalaxy, LMC and SMC, respectively. We map the strength of the FeCZ on the\nHertzsprung-Russell diagram for three metallicities, and compare this with the\noccurrence of observational phenomena in O stars: microturbulence, non-radial\npulsations, wind clumping, and line profile variability. The confirmation of\nall three trends for the FeCZ as function of stellar parameters by empirical\nmicroturbulent velocities argues for a physical connection between\nsub-photospheric convective motions and small scale stochastic velocities in\nthe photosphere of O- and B-type stars. We further suggest that clumping in the\ninner parts of the winds of OB stars could be caused by the same mechanism, and\nthat magnetic fields produced in the FeCZ could appear at the surface of OB\nstars as diagnosed by discrete absorption components in ultraviolet absorption\nlines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2009 20:02:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

This is the first attempt to test a model of fast\nmagnetic reconnection in the presence of weak turbulence proposed by Lazarian &\nVishniac (1999). This model predicts that weak turbulence, generically present\nin most of astrophysical systems, enhances the rate of reconnection by reducing\nthe transverse scale for reconnection events and by allowing many independent\nflux reconnection events to occur simultaneously. As a result the reconnection\nspeed becomes independent of Ohmic resistivity and is determined by the\nmagnetic field wandering induced by turbulence. To quantify the reconnection\nspeed we use both an intuitive definition, i.e. the speed of the reconnected\nflux inflow, as well as a more sophisticated definition based on a formally\nderived analytical expression. Our results confirm the predictions of the\nLazarian & Vishniac model. In particular, we find that Vrec Pinj^(1/2), as\npredicted by the model. The dependence on the injection scale for some of our\nmodels is a bit weaker than expected, i.e. l^(3/4), compared to the predicted\nlinear dependence on the injection scale, which may require some refinement of\nthe model or may be due to the effects like finite size of the excitation\nregion. The reconnection speed was found to depend on the expected rate of\nmagnetic field wandering and not on the magnitude of the guide field. In our\nmodels, we see no dependence on the guide field when its strength is comparable\nto the reconnected component. More importantly, while in the absence of\nturbulence we successfully reproduce the Sweet-Parker scaling of reconnection,\nin the presence of turbulence we do not observe any dependence on Ohmic\nresistivity, confirming that our reconnection is fast.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2009 20:11:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 14 Mar 2009 14:23:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2009 15:35:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-05"}

The discovery was made with the High Energy Stereoscopic System\n(H.E.S.S.), which currently provides the most sensitive measurement in the\nenergy range of about 0.2-100 TeV. This analysis is the first to include all\nH.E.S.S. data from observations dedicated to MSH 15-52. The corresponding flux\nabove 1 TeV is (4.4+/-0.2stat+/-1.0syst) x 10^{-12}cm^{-2}s^{-1}.

Many of these\nformation scenarios predict a high-redshift population of intermediate-mass\nblack holes (IMBHs), with masses in the range 100 to 100000 times that of the\nSun. A powerful way to observe these IMBHs is via gravitational waves the black\nholes emit as they merge. The statistics of the observed black hole population\nshould, in principle, allow us to discriminate between competing astrophysical\nscenarios for the origin and formation of SMBHs. However, gravitational wave\ndetectors such as LISA will not be able to detect all such mergers nor assign\nprecise black hole parameters to the merger, due to weak gravitational wave\nsignal strengths. In order to use LISA observations to infer the statistics of\nthe underlying population, these errors must be taken into account.

An automatic and objective approach\nconsists in fitting the data using a generalised least-squares method, where\nthe function to be minimized is defined to handle asymmetrically the data at\nboth sides of the boundary. In order to minimise the cost function, a numerical\napproach, based on the popular downhill simplex method, is employed. The\nprocedure is valid for any numerically computable function. Simple polynomials\nprovide good boundaries in common situations. For data exhibiting a complex\nbehaviour, the use of adaptive splines gives excellent results. Since the\ndescribed method is sensitive to extreme data points, the simultaneous\nintroduction of error weighting and the flexibility of allowing some points to\nfall outside of the fitted frontier, supplies the parameters that help to tune\nthe boundary fitting depending on the nature of the considered problem. Two\nsimple examples are presented, namely the estimation of spectra\npseudo-continuum and the segregation of scattered data into ranges. The\nnormalisation of the data ranges prior to the fitting computation typically\nreduces both the numerical errors and the number of iterations required during\nthe iterative minimisation procedure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2009 22:08:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Twenty-one horizontal branch stars\n(out of which 5 EHBs) in NGC5986 and 31 in M80 (11 EHBs) were observed during\nfour consecutive nights.

The detection of synchrotron emission extending to about 70 GeV in the\nsource frame in GRB 080916C favors the Bohm diffusive shock acceleration if the\nbulk Lorentz factor of the relativistic outflow is not significantly greater\nthan thousands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2009 09:35:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 18 Apr 2009 00:57:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

However, the observed polarization may be modified\ndue to photon propagation through the star's magnetosphere. For photon\nfrequencies much larger than the typical radio frequency, vacuum birefringence\ndue to strong-field quantum electrodynamics dominates over the plasma effect.\nWe study the evolution of photon polarization in the magnetized QED vacuum of a\nneutron star magnetosphere, paying particular attention to the propagation\neffect across the quasi-tangential (QT) point, where the photon momentum is\nnearly aligned with the magnetic field. In agreement with previous studies, we\nfind that in most regions of the magnetosphere, the photon polarization modes\nare decoupled due to vacuum birefringence, and therefore a large net linear\npolarization can be expected when the radiation escapes the magnetosphere.\nHowever, we show that X-ray polarization may change significantly when the\nphoton passes through the QT region. When averaging over a finite emission\narea, the net effect of QT propagation is to reduce the degree of linear\npolarization; the reduction factor depends on the photon energy, magnetic field\nstrength, geometry, rotation phase and the emission area, and can be more than\na factor of two. We derive the general conditions under which the QT\npropagation effect is important, and provide an easy-to-use prescription to\naccount for the QT effect for most practical calculations of X-ray polarization\nsignals from magnetic neutron stars. For a neutron star with a dipole magnetic\nfield, the QT effect can be important for emission from the polar cap for\ncertain magnetic field and energy ranges, and is negligible for emission from\nthe entire stellar surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2009 03:56:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2009 10:24:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Any attempt to eavesdrop on the protocol introduces errors\ndetectable by the legitimate parties.\n  This Licentiate Thesis studies the recently introduced EEQKD protocol which\nbuilds on BB84.

The new method is suitable to\nclassify K giants (and later) as well as B2 main sequence (and earlier) stars\nwhich are brighter than 15.5 mag in the K band in the central parsec.

The observed\ncontinuum consists of two components; a power-law component dominating optical\nwavelengths which is the direct light from the central source and thermal\nemission dominating near-infrared wavelengths which is attributed to the\nemission from hot dust in the circumnuclear region. The thermal emission well\nrepresents optically thick emission by hot dust at T ~ 1300K with tau(2micron)>\n2 and apparent mass, M(hot) >10 M_sun.

The space of holomorphic 1-forms on $X$ has dimension $g$ as a complex\nvector space. Fundamental results on divisors on compact Riemann surfaces are\nstated and proved. The Riemann-Roch theorem is of utmost importance in the\nalgebraic geometric theory of compact Riemann surfaces.

The $\\mu$-$\\tau$ symmetry\nis spontaneously broken through the 120-plet.

Small explicit breaking of the\n$\\mu$-$\\tau$ symmetry is then shown to provide a very good understanding of all\nthe fermion masses and mixing.

After deriving\nand solving the master equation for each case, we analyze the decoherence\nprocess of particular entanglements in the positional space of both\noscillators. To analyze the decoherence mechanism we have derived a general\ndecay function for the off-diagonal peaks of the density matrix, which applies\nboth to a common and separate reservoirs. We have also identified the expected\ninteraction between the two dissipative oscillators induced by their common\nreservoir. Such reservoir-induced interaction, which gives rise to interesting\ncollective damping effects, such as the emergence of relaxation- and\ndecoherence-free subspaces, is shown to be blurred by the high-temperature\nregime considered in this study.

In this paper, we start by studying\nhow many non-local boxes Alice and Bob need in order to compute a Boolean\nfunction f. We provide tight upper and lower bounds in terms of the\ncommunication complexity of the function both in the deterministic and\nrandomized case. We then proceed to show that the study of non-local box\ncomplexity has interesting applications for classical computation as well. In\nparticular, we look at secure function evaluation, and study the question posed\nby Beimel and Malkin of how many Oblivious Transfer calls Alice and Bob need in\norder to securely compute a function f. We show that this question is related\nto the non-local box complexity of the function and conclude by greatly\nimproving their bounds.

The main advantages of TDG by PE include\nflexibility to handle new coverage criteria, the possibility to obtain\ntest-case generators and its simplicity to be implemented. The approach in\nprinciple can be directly applied for TDG of any imperative language. However,\nwhen one tries to apply it to a declarative language like Prolog, we have found\nas a main difficulty the generation of test-cases which cover the more complex\ncontrol flow of Prolog. Essentially, the problem is that an intrinsic feature\nof PE is that it only computes non-failing derivations while in TDG for Prolog\nit is essential to generate test-cases associated to failing computations.\nBasically, we propose to transform the original Prolog program into an\nequivalent Prolog program with explicit failure by partially evaluating a\nProlog interpreter which captures failing derivations w.r.t. the input program.\nAnother issue that we discuss in the paper is that, while in the case of\nbytecode the underlying constraint domain only manipulates integers, in Prolog\nit should properly handle the symbolic data manipulated by the program. The\nresulting scheme is of interest for bringing the advantages which are inherent\nin TDG by PE to the field of logic programming.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2009 15:51:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-13"}
