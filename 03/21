This indicates low mass-loss\nrates and makes them also hard to detect. However, such stars are possible\nemitters of strong He+ Lyman continua that in turn could ionize observable\nHeIII regions, i.e. highly excited HII regions emitting nebular HeII4686\nemission. We here report the discovery of a rare HeIII region in the SMC which\nis located in the OB association NGC249 around the weak-lined WN star SMC WR10.\nWR10 is particularly interesting since it is a single star showing the presence\nof atmospheric hydrogen. While analysing the spectrum in the framework of two\npopular WR atmosphere models, we found for the same input parameters strongly\ndiscrepant predictions (by 1 dex) for the He+ Lyman continuum. A second aspect\nof the work reported here concerns the beautiful MCELS images which clearly\nreveal a class of strongly [OIII]5007 emitting (blue-coded) nebulae. Not\nunexpectedly, most of the 'blue' nebulae are known Wolf-Rayet bubbles, but new\nbubbles around a few WRs are also detected. Moreover, we report the existence\nof blue nebulae without associated known WRs and discuss the possibility that\nthey reveal weak-wind WR stars with very faint stellar HeII4686 emission.\nAlternatively, such nebulae might hint at the hitherto missing population of\nrelatively low-mass, hot He stars predicted by massive binary evolution\ncalculations. Such a binary system is probably responsible for the ionization\nof the unique HeII4686-emitting nebula N44C.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Mar 2009 16:25:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The predicted properties are\ncompared with the Suzaku observational data of the Seyfert 1 galaxy\nMCG--6-30-15. The data disfavor models with the X-ray source (1) moving\nvertically on the symmetry axis or (2) corotating with the disc and changing\nheight not far above the disc surface. The most likely explanation for the\nobserved variability is given by the model involving the X-ray source located\nat a very small, varying distance from a rapidly rotating black hole. This\nmodel predicts some enhanced variations in the red wing of the Fe line, which\nare not seen in the Suzaku observations. However, the enhanced variability of\nthe red wing, while ruled out by the Suzaku data, is consistent with an excess\nRMS variability, between 5 and 6 keV, reported for some previous ASCA and XMM\nobservations. We speculate that the presence or lack of such a feature is\nrelated to the change of the ionization state of the innermost part of the\ndisc, however, investigation of such effects is currently not possible in our\nmodel (where a neutral disc is assumed).

By analysing the smoothed density field and its Hessian matrix, we\ncan determine the types of structure - walls, filaments, or clumps - that\ndominate the large-scale distribution of galaxies as a function of scale. We\nhave run the algorithm on mock galaxy distributions in a LCDM cosmological\nN-body simulation and the observed galaxy distributions in the Sloan Digital\nSky Survey. The morphology of structure is similar between the two catalogues,\nboth being filament-dominated on 10-20 h^{-1} Mpc smoothing scales and\nclump-dominated on 5 h^{-1} Mpc scales. There is evidence for walls in both\ndistributions, but walls are not the dominant structures on scales smaller than\n~25 h^{-1} Mpc. Analysis of the simulation suggests that, on a given comoving\nsmoothing scale, structures evolve with time from walls to filaments to clumps,\nwhere those found on smaller smoothing scales are further in this progression\nat a given time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Mar 2009 04:44:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 May 2010 20:11:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The\ngeneral problem is known as the m-vehicle Dynamic Traveling Repairman Problem\n(m-DTRP). The best previously known control algorithms rely on centralized\na-priori task assignment and are not robust against changes in the environment,\ne.g. changes in load conditions; therefore, they are of limited applicability\nin scenarios involving ad-hoc networks of autonomous vehicles operating in a\ntime-varying environment.

But the nature\nof dark energy is mysterious and its puzzling questions, such as why, how,\nwhere and when about the dark energy, are intriguing. In the present paper the\nauthors attempt to answer these questions while making an effort to reveal the\ngenesis of dark energy and suggest that `the cosmological nuclear binding\nenergy liberated during primordial nucleo-synthesis remains trapped for a long\ntime and then is released free which manifests itself as dark energy in the\nuniverse'. It is also explained why for dark energy the parameter $w = -\n{2/3}$. Noting that $ w = 1$ for stiff matter and $w = {1/3}$ for radiation; $w\n= - {2/3}$ is for dark energy because $\"-1\"$ is due to `deficiency of\nstiff-nuclear-matter' and that this binding energy is ultimately released as\n`radiation' contributing $\"+ {1/3}\"$, making $w = -1 + {1/3} = - {2/3}$. When\ndark energy is released free at $Z = 80$, $w = -{2/3}$. But as on present day\nat $Z = 0$ when radiation strength has diminished to $\\delta \\to 0$, $w = -1 +\n\\delta{1/3} = - 1$. This, thus almost solves the dark-energy mystery of\nnegative pressure and repulsive-gravity. The proposed theory makes several\nestimates /predictions which agree reasonably well with the astrophysical\nconstraints and observations. Though there are many candidate-theories, the\nproposed model of this paper presents an entirely new approach (cosmological\nnuclear energy) as a possible candidate for dark energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Mar 2009 04:49:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2009 13:27:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

Knowing the total\nproduction cross section is important for searching for these states and\nestablishing bounds on their masses and couplings. Using soft-collinear\neffective theory, we derive a factorization theorem for the process $pp\\to SX$,\nwhere $S$ is a color-octet scalar, that is applicable to any NP model provided\nthe dominant production mechanism is gluon-gluon fusion. The factorized result\nfor the inclusive cross section is similar to that for the Standard Model Higgs\nproduction, however, differences arise due to color exchange between initial\nand final states. We provide formulae for the total cross section with large\n(partonic) threshold logarithms resummed to next-to-leading logarithm (NLL)\naccuracy. The resulting $K$-factors are similar to those found in Higgs\nproduction. We apply our formalism to the Manohar-Wise model and find that the\nNLL cross section is roughly 2 times (3 times) as large as the leading order\ncross section for a color-octet scalar of mass of 500 GeV (3 TeV). A similar\nenhancement should appear in any NP model with color-octet scalars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Mar 2009 14:16:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2009 13:23:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-24"}
