In this paper, we construct the actual twistor scattering\namplitudes themselves. We show that the recursion relations of Britto, Cachazo,\nFeng and Witten have a natural twistor formulation that, together with the\nthree-point seed amplitudes, allows us to recursively construct general tree\namplitudes in twistor space.

This gives a\nformulation of scattering amplitudes in maximally supersymmetric theories in\nwhich superconformal symmetry and its breaking is manifest. For N^kMHV, the\namplitudes are given by 2n-4 integrals in the form of Hilbert transforms of a\nproduct of $n-k-2$ purely geometric, superconformally invariant twistor delta\nfunctions, dressed by certain sign operators.

We suggest that this dual description lives in (2,2) signature and is\nnaturally formulated in twistor space. We recast the BCFW recursion relations\nin an on-shell form that begs to be transformed into twistor space. Our twistor\ntransformation is inspired by Witten's, but differs in treating twistor and\ndual twistor variables more equally. In these variables the three and\nfour-point amplitudes are amazingly simple; the BCFW relations are represented\nby diagrammatic rules that precisely define the \"twistor diagrams\" of Andrew\nHodges. The \"Hodges diagrams\" for Yang-Mills theory are disks and not trees;\nthey reveal striking connections between amplitudes and suggest a new form for\nthem in momentum space. We also obtain a twistorial formulation of gravity. All\ntree amplitudes can be combined into an \"S-Matrix\" functional which is the\nnatural holographic observable in asymptotically flat space; the BCFW formula\nturns into a quadratic equation for this \"S-Matrix\", providing a holographic\ndescription of N=4 SYM and N=8 Supergravity at tree level.

In this work, we employ a phenomenological entropy form of\nideal gas, first proposed by White & Narayan, to revisit this issue. By\ncalculating the first-order variation of the entropy, subject to the mass- and\nenergy-conservation constraints, we obtain an entropy stationary equation.\nIncorporated with the Jeans equation, and by specifying some functional form\nfor the anisotropy parameter beta, we numerically solve the two equations, and\ndemonstrate that the velocity anisotropy parameter plays an important role to\nattain a density profile that is finite in mass, energy, and spatial extent. If\nincorporated again with some empirical density profile from simulations, our\ntheoretical predictions of the anisotropy parameter, and the radial\npseudo-phase-space density in the outer non-gravitationally degenerate region\nof the dark matter halo, agree rather well with the simulation data, and the\npredictions are also acceptable in the middle weak-degenerate region of the\ndark halo. The second-order variational calculus reveals the seemingly\nparadoxical but actually complementary consequence that the equilibrium state\nof self-gravitating systems is the global minimum entropy state for the whole\nsystem under long-range violent relaxation, but simultaneously the local\nmaximum entropy state for every and any small part of the system under\nshort-range two-body relaxation and Landau damping. This minimum-maximum\nentropy duality means that the standard second law of thermodynamics needs to\nbe re-expressed or generalized for self-gravitating systems. We believe that\nour findings, especially the complementary second law of thermodynamics, may\nprovide crucial clues to the development of the statistical physics of\nself-gravitating systems as well as other long-range interaction systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2009 16:17:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 May 2010 23:15:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-09"}

For planets that can not be spatially separated from their host\nstars, i.e. the vast majority of planets, the transiting planets are the only\nones allowing to probe their atmospheres. This is possible from transmission\nspectroscopy or from measurements taken during secondary eclipse. An\nalternative is the measurement of the Rossiter-McLaughlin-effect, which is\nsensitive to the size of the planetary radius. Since the radius is\nwavelength-dependent due to contributions of strong planetary absorption lines,\nthis opens a path to probe planetary atmospheres also with ground-based\nhigh-resolution spectroscopy. The major goal of our numerical simulations is to\nprovide a reliable estimate of the amplitude of the wavelength-dependent\nRM-effect. Our numerical simulations provide phase resolved synthetic spectra\nmodeling the partly eclipsed stellar surface during the transit in detail.\nUsing these spectra we can obtain RM-curves for different wavelength regions\nand for a wavelength-dependent planetary radius. Curves from regions with high\nand low contributions of absorption lines within the planetary atmosphere can\nbe compared. From these differential effects observable quantities are derived.\nWe applied our simulations to HD209458. Our numerical simulations show that a\ndetailed treatment of the limb darkening for the synthetic spectra is important\nfor a precise analysis. Compared to a parameterized limb darkening law,\nsystematic errors of 6 m/sec occur. The wavelength dependency of the planetary\natmospheres over the NaD-doublet produce a differential effect in the RM-curve\nof 1.5 m/sec for a star with a rotation velocity of 4.5 km/sec which increases\nto 4 m/sec for twice the rotation velocity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2009 17:08:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Several investigations\nusing NICMOS and the most advanced AO imagers on the ground revealed an overall\ntop-heavy IMF for the cluster, with a very flat IMF near the center.

Using medium-resolution (R=900-1320) H and K spectroscopy, we\nfirmly establish the nature of the brightest stars in these clusters, yielding\nnew identifications of an early WC and two Ofpe/WN9 stars in the Quartet and an\nearly WC star in GLIMPSE20. We combine this information with the available\nphotometric measurements from 2MASS, to estimate cluster masses, ages, and\ndistances. The presence of several massive stars places the Quartet and\nGLIMPSE20 among the small sample of known Galactic stellar clusters with masses\nof a few 10^3 Msun, and ages from 3 to 8 Myr. We estimate a distance of about\n3.5 kpc for Glimpse 20, and 6.0 kpc for Quartet. The large number of giant\nstars identified in GLIMPSE13 indicates that it is another massive (~ 6500\nMsun) cluster, but older, with an age between 30 and 100 Myr, at a distance of\nabout 3 kpc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2009 18:12:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

In order to assess whether the driving of turbulence by supernovae is\nalso important in the outer Galactic disk, where the star formation rates are\nlower, we study the spatial distribution of molecular cloud (MC) inclinations\nwith respect to the Galactic plane. The latter contains important information\non the nature of the mechanism of energy injection into the ISM. We analyze the\nspatial correlations between the position angles (PAs) of a selected sample of\nMCs (the largest clouds in the catalogue of the outer Galaxy published by Heyer\net al. 2001). Our results show that when the PAs of the clouds are all mapped\nto values into the [0,90]degrees interval, there is a significant degree of\nspatial correlation between the $PA$s on spatial scales in the range of 100-800\npc. These scales are of the order of the sizes of individual SN shells in low\ndensity environments such as those prevailing in the outer Galaxy and where the\nmetallicity of the ambient gas is of the order of the solar value or smaller.\nThese findings suggest that individual SN explosions, occurring in the outer\nregions of the Galaxy and in likewise spiral galaxies, albeit at lower rates,\ncontinue to play an important role in shaping the structure and dynamics of the\nISM in those regions. The SN explosions we postulate here are likely associated\nwith the existence of young stellar clusters in the far outer regions of the\nGalaxy and the UV emission and low levels of star formation observed with the\nGALEX satellite in the outer regions of local galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2009 19:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Jun 2009 22:33:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Because a study of information rates led to the Noiseless\nand Noisy Coding Theorems, two of the most important results of Shannon's\ntheory, we begin the paper by defining a pragmatic information rate, showing\nthat all of the relevant limits make sense, and interpreting them as the\nimprovement in compression obtained from using the correct distribution of\ntransmitted symbols.\n  The first of two applications of the theory extends the information theoretic\nanalysis of the Kelly Criterion, and its generalization, the horse race, to a\nseries of races where the stochastic process of winning horses, payoffs, and\nstrategies depend on some stationary process, including, but not limited to the\nhistory of previous races. If the bettor is receiving messages (side\ninformation) about the probability distribution of winners, the doubling rate\nof the bettor's winnings is bounded by the pragmatic information of the\nmessages.\n  A second application is to the question of market efficiency. An efficient\nmarket is, by definition, a market in which the pragmatic information of the\n\"tradable past\" with respect to current prices is zero. Under this definition,\nmarkets whose returns are characterized by a GARCH(1,1) process cannot be\nefficient.\n  Finally, a pragmatic informational analogue to Shannon's Noisy Coding Theorem\nsuggests that a cause of market inefficiency is that the underlying\nfundamentals are changing so fast that the price discovery mechanism simply\ncannot keep up. This may happen most readily in the run-up to a financial\nbubble, where investors' willful ignorance degrade the information processing\ncapabilities of the market.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2009 18:27:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 11 Dec 2010 06:00:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2011 14:55:08 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 22 Sep 2014 23:48:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-24"}

Second, for both the multiple\nequilibria and periodic solutions transitions, both Type-I (continuous) and\nType-II (jump) transitions can occur, and precise criteria are derived in terms\nof two computable nondimensional parameters $b_1$ and $b_2$. Associated with\nType-II transitions are the hysteresis phenomena, and the physical reality is\nrepresented by either metastable states or by a local attractor away from the\nbasic solution, showing more complex dynamical behavior. Third, a convection\nscale law is introduced, leading to an introduction of proper friction terms in\nthe model in order to derive the correct circulation length scale.

Our observations are a continuation of a\npilot study by Greene & Ho (2007). Of the 8 objects observed, 5 are detected\nwith X-ray luminosities in the range L_0.5-2 keV = 10^41--10^43 erg s^-1,\nconsistent with the previously observed sample. Objects with enough counts to\nextract a spectrum are well fit by an absorbed power law. We continue to find a\nrange of soft photon indices 1 < \\Gamma_s < 2.7, where N(E) \\propto\nE^-\\Gamma_s, consistent with previous AGN studies, but generally flatter than\nother narrow-line Seyfert 1 active nuclei (NLS1s). The soft photon index\ncorrelates strongly with X-ray luminosity and Eddington ratio, but does not\ndepend on BH mass. There is no justification for the inclusion of any\nadditional components, such as a soft excess, although this may be a function\nof the relative inefficiency of detecting counts above 2 keV in these\nrelatively shallow observations. As a whole, the X-ray-to-optical spectral\nslope \\alpha_ox is flatter than in more massive systems, even other NLS1s. Only\nX-ray-selected NLS1s with very high Eddington ratios share a similar \\alpha_ox.\nThis is suggestive of a physical change in the accretion structure at low\nmasses and at very high accretion rates, possibly due to the onset of slim\ndisks. Although the detailed physical explanation for the X-ray loudness of\nthese intermediate-mass BHs is not certain, it is very striking that targets\nselected on the basis of optical properties should be so distinctly offset in\ntheir broader spectral energy distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2009 20:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

Its reported\nphysical properties are also extreme, including the largest radius for any star\nknown and an effective temperature that is much cooler than other RSGs in the\nLMC, both of which are at variance with stellar evolutionary theory. We fit\nmoderate-resolution optical spectrophotometry of WOH G64 with the MARCS stellar\natmosphere models, determining an effective temperature of 3400 +/- 25 K.

We determine a radius of R/R_sun = 1540, bringing the size of WOH G64\nand its position on the H-R diagram into agreement with the largest known\nGalactic RSGs, although it is still extreme for the LMC.

Methods: Very Large Telescope/FORS2 imaging and spectroscopy plus\narchival Hubble Space Telescope/ACS imaging datasets permit us to spatially\nidentify the location, number and probable subtypes of Wolf-Rayet stars within\nthis galaxy. We also investigate suggestions that a significant fraction of the\nionizing photons of the two giant HII regions A1 and A2 lie deeply embedded\nwithin these regions. Results: Wolf-Rayet stars are associated with a number of\nsources within IC 4662-A1 and A2, plus a third compact HII region to the north\nwest of A1 (A1-NW).Several sources appear to be isolated, single (or binary)\nluminous nitrogen sequence WR stars, while extended sources are clusters whose\nmasses exceed the Orion Nebula Cluster by, at most, a factor of two.

We assume that the grains are composed of\nsilicates and ellipsoidal (oblate, prolate, or tri-axial ellipsoid) in shape\nwith a typical axial ratio of 2:1. The angular dependence of circular\npolarization p_c on directions of incident and scattered light is investigated\nwith spherical harmonics and associated Legendre polynomials. The degree of\ncircular polarization p_c also depends on the Rayleigh reduction factor R which\nis a measure of imperfect alignment. We find that p_c is approximately\nproportional to R for grains with |m|x_{eq} < 3 - 5, where x_{eq} is the\ndimensionless size parameter and m is the refractive index of the grain.

Although the model under\nconsideration is nontrivial enough to exhibit the decoherence and the approach\nto equilibrium, the derived necessary condition is not fulfilled and thus the\nequilibrium state depends on the initial state of the spin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Mar 2009 03:43:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2010 08:41:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 13 Apr 2010 15:50:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-20"}

In the deeper layers, however, the coupling is expected to be\nmuch stronger. Aims: This raises the question of whether the magnetic field\nstill leads to the formation of structures in the photosphere. Methods: We\ncarried out a spectroscopic monitoring campaign of two ultracool dwarfs that\nhave strong magnetic fields: the BD LP944-20 and 2MASSW J0036159+182110.\nLP944-20 was observed simultaneously in the optical and in the near infrared\nregime, 2MASSW J0036159+182110 only in the infrared. Results: Both dwarfs\nturned out to be remarkably constant. In the case of LP944-20, the\nTeff-variations are <50K, and the rms-variations in the equivalent widths of\nHalpha small. We also find that the equivalent widths of photospheric lines are\nremarkably constant. We did not find any significant variations in the case of\n2MASSW J0036159+182110 either. Thus the most important result is that no\nsignificant variability was found at the time of our observations.

Conclusions: We interpret these results\nas evidence that the photosphere of these objects are remarkably homogeneous,\nwith only little structure in them, and despite the strong magnetic fields.\nThus, unlike active stars, there are no prominent spots on these objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Mar 2009 09:43:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

I find that both the broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs)\nquasi-simultaneously obtained during the TeV flare and during the optical/X-ray\noutburst are well fit by using a single-zone synchrotron +\nsynchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) model. The satisfactory fitting requires a large\nbeaming factor, i.e., $\\delta\\sim 25$ and $\\delta\\sim 20$ for the TeV flare and\nthe optical/X-ray outburst, respectively, suggesting that both the\noptical/X-ray outburst and the TeV flare are from a relativistic jet.

The GeV emission is critical to characterize the SEDs\nof the optical/X-ray outburst and the TeV flare.

In the former case, we extend the boundary conformal field\ntheory method, developed in the context of single chains, to handle the ladder\nproblem, and we find exact closed-form analytical expressions for the\ncorrelation functions. This allows us to compute experimentally measurable\nlocal quantities such as the nuclear magnetic resonance line broadenings and\nscanning tunnelling microscope profiles. We also discuss the low doping regime\nwhere Kondo physics is at play, making qualitative predictions about its\nnature. Insight into collective effects is also given in the many weak\nimpurities case, based on an RG approach. In this regime, one sees the\ninterplay between interactions and disorder. We emphasize the influence of the\nO atoms on disorder effects both for the single- and for the many-defect\nsituations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Mar 2009 10:24:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-15"}

So long as\nspin-orbit coupling (SOC) is neglected, the double chain lowest energy state is\ngenerally antiferromagnetic (AFM), a state which appears to prevail over the FM\nstate due to Fe-Ir hybridization. Successive inclusion of SOC adds two further\nelements, namely a magnetocrystalline anisotropy, and a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\n(DM) spin-spin interaction, the former stabilizing the collinear AFM state, the\nsecond favoring a long-period spin modulation. We find that anisotropy is most\nimportant when the double chain is adsorbed on the partially deconstructed\nIr(100) -- a state which we find to be substantially lower in energy than any\nreconstructed structure -- so that in this case the Fe double chain should\nremain collinear AFM.

The new collision model treated\nboth accretion and erosion of planetesimals but did not include dynamical\nfriction from debris particles smaller than the resolution limit for the\nsimulation. By extending our numerical model to include dynamical friction from\nthe unresolved debris, we can simulate the dynamical effect of debris produced\nduring collisions and can also investigate the effect of initial debris mass on\nterrestrial planet formation. We find that significant initial debris mass, 10%\nor more of the total disk mass, changes the mode of planetesimal growth.\nSpecifically, planetesimals in this situation do not go through a runaway\ngrowth phase. Instead they grow concurrently, similar to oligarchic growth. In\naddition to including the dynamical friction from the unresolved debris, we\nhave implemented particle tracking as a proxy for monitoring compositional\nmixing. Although there is much less mixing due to collisions and gravitational\nscattering when dynamical friction of the background debris is included, there\nis significant inward migration of the largest protoplanets in the most extreme\ninitial conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Mar 2009 10:49:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

For a subsample of 452 clusters\nwith at least 10 measured radial velocities, we find a median BCM peculiar\nvelocity of 32% of their host clusters' radial velocity dispersion. This\nsuggests that most BCMs are not at rest in the potential well of their\nclusters, and that the phenomenon is thus not a special trait of clusters\nhosting cD galaxies. We show that the peculiar velocity of the BCM is\nindependent of cluster richness and only slightly dependent on the Bautz-Morgan\ntype.

The strongest dependence is with the morphological\ntype of the BCM: cD galaxies tend to have lower relative peculiar velocities\nthan elliptical galaxies.

For such spontaneous movements, a variety of different modes have been\nobserved, including the amoeboid-like locomotion with protrusion of multiple\npseudopods, the keratocyte-like locomotion with a widely spread lamellipodium,\ncell division with two daughter cells crawling in opposite directions, and\nfragmentations of a cell to multiple pieces. Mutagenesis studies have revealed\nthat cells exhibit these modes depending on which genes are deficient,\nsuggesting that seemingly different modes are the manifestation of a common\nmechanism to regulate cell motion. In this paper, we propose a hypothesis that\nthe positive feedback mechanism working through the inhomogeneous distribution\nof regulatory proteins underlies this variety of cell locomotion and\ncytofission. In this hypothesis, a set of regulatory proteins, which we call\ncortical factors, suppress actin polymerization. These suppressing factors are\ndiluted at the extending front and accumulated at the retracting rear of cell,\nwhich establishes a cellular polarity and enhances the cell motility, leading\nto the further accumulation of cortical factors at the rear. Stochastic\nsimulation of cell movement shows that the positive feedback mechanism of\ncortical factors stabilizes or destabilizes modes of movement and determines\nthe cell migration pattern. The model predicts that the pattern is selected by\nchanging the rate of formation of the actin-filament network or the threshold\nto initiate the network formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Mar 2009 12:56:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-16"}

It is demonstrated that the amplification of those waves\nleads to amplification of turbulence. The phenomenology of Shakura-Sunyaev for\nthe friction in accretion disks is derived in the framework of the Kolmogorov\nturbulence. The presented findings may be the key to explaining the anomalous\nplasma heating responsible for the luminosity of quasars. It is suggested that\nwave amplification is the keystone of the self-sustained turbulence in\naccretion disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Mar 2009 14:01:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Apr 2009 16:44:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 27 May 2009 15:34:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-13"}

Such an equation is called $V$-soliton equation, which can be\nregarded as a generalization of K\\\"ahler-Einstein equations or K\\\"ahler-Ricci\nsolitons.

Coherent neutrino-neutrino scattering has been found\nto play a role in the flavour evolution of the system. Traditionally this\nproblem has been analysed by assuming that the wavefunction of the system can\nbe factorised into one-body states. However in 1992 Pantaleone showed that a\nneutrino ensemble is in general a many-body problem due to the off-diagonal\ncontribution to the neutrino refractive index. This topic was unexamined until\nrecently. It has been suggested by Bell, Rawlinson and Sawyer that quantum\nentanglement could play an essential role in the flavour evolution of the dense\nneutrino system.\n  In this thesis we examine the validity of the one-body approximation by\nconstructing a many-body neutrino model. The neutrino system is modelled by a\nsystem of interacting spins following earlier work of Friedland and Lunardini.\nWe extend this work by generalising the model to initial states with asymmetric\nflavour composition. We find an exact analytical solution to the system. The\ninvestigation has revealed an array of interesting physics including\nsemi-classical behaviour, quantum equilibration and a transition from\nsemi-classical to purely quantum regimes. Further, this study has found no\nevidence for the violation of the one-body description of a dense neutrino\nensemble. We also note that our analysis is valid for any two state system with\nequal strength interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2009 22:24:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-18"}
