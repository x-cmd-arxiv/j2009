The method uses two expansions for the Green function,\nvalid in `quasilocal' and `distant past' regimes, which are matched within the\nnormal neighbourhood. We perform our calculation in a static region of the\nspherically symmetric Nariai spacetime (dS_2 x S^2), on which scalar\nperturbations are governed by a radial equation with a P\\\"oschl-Teller\npotential. We combine (i) a very high order quasilocal expansion, and (ii) an\nexpansion in quasinormal modes, to determine the Green function globally. We\nshow it is singular everywhere on the null wavefront (even outside the normal\nneighbourhood), and apply asymptotic methods to determine its singular\nstructure. We find the Green function undergoes a transition every time the\nnull wavefront passes through a caustic: the singular part follows a repeating\nfour-fold sequence $\\delta(\\sigma)$, $1/\\pi \\sigma$, $-\\delta(\\sigma)$, $-1/\\pi\n\\sigma$ etc., where $\\sigma$ is Synge's world function.\n  The matched expansion method provides new insight into the non-local\nproperties of the self-force; we find the contribution from the segment of the\nworldline lying outside the normal neighbourhood is significant. We compute the\nscalar self-force acting on a static particle, and validate against an\nalternative method. Finally, we discuss wave propagation on black hole\nspacetimes (where any expansion in quasinormal modes will be augmented by a\nbranch cut integral) and predict that the Green function in Schwarzschild\nspacetime will inherit the four-fold singular structure found here.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2009 20:52:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Mar 2009 21:58:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2009 20:38:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-09"}

We adopt a four-dimensional perspective in which the\nlocalized degrees of freedom on the brane are regarded as an open quantum\nsystem coupled to the large environment composed of the Anti-de Sitter ($AdS$)\nbulk gravitons. Due to the non-uniform expansion of the universe, the brane\ndegrees of freedom and the bulk degrees of freedom interact as they propagate\nforward in time, leading to an effective dissipation as well as a nonlocality\nfrom the four-dimensional point of view of an observer on the brane. Using both\nthe \"bare\" retarded propagator on the brane and the retarded propagator in the\nbulk, we compute the effective propagator on the brane for the \"dressed\" brane\nmodes by resumming the bulk backreaction effects at all order in the brane-bulk\ncoupling. Dissipation and nonlocality are encoded into the effective brane\npropagator. We find the dissipation rates of various matter perturbations on\nthe brane as well as of the graviton bound state. Next we present an explicit\ncalculation of the covariant retarded Green function for the graviton in $AdS$\nspace.

Soft X-ray excesses have been detected in several Be/X-ray binaries and\ninterpreted as the signature of hard X-ray reprocessing in the inner accretion\ndisk. The system XMMU J054134.7-682550, located in the LMC, featured a giant\nType II outburst in August 2007. The geometry of this system can be understood\nby studying the response of the soft excess emission to the hard X-ray pulses.\n  Methods. We have analyzed series of simultaneous observations obtained with\nXMM-Newton/EPIC-MOS and RXTE/PCA in order to derive spectral and temporal\ncharacteristics of the system, before, during and after the giant outburst.\nSpectral fits were performed and a timing analysis has been carried out.\nSpectral variability, spin period evolution and energy dependent pulse shapes\nare analysed.\n  Results. The outburst (L_X = 3* 10^38 erg/s \\approx L_EDD) spectrum could be\nmodeled successfully using a cutoff powerlaw, a cold disk emission, a hot\nblackbody, and a cyclotron absorption line. The magnetic field and\nmagnetospheric radius could be constrained. The thickness of the inner\naccretion disk is broadened to a width of 75 km. The hot blackbody component\nfeatures sinusoidal modulations indicating that the bulk of the hard X-ray\nemission is emitted preferentially along the magnetic equator. The spin period\nof the pulsar decreased very significantly during the outburst. This is\nconsistent with a variety of neutron star equations of state and indicates a\nvery high accretion rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2009 17:32:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-25"}

The focus is then\non behavioural and interaction rules by using approaches based on artificial\nagents designed to reproduce swarm-like behaviours in a virtual world by using\nsymbolic, sub-symbolic and agent-based models. A new research approach has been\nintroduced based on meta-structures, i.e. variable structures of mesoscopic\nvariables possibly suitable for a general theory of emergence. In this approach\nI consider the coherence of collective behaviours, i.e., their identity\ndetected by the observer, as represented by meta-structures. Meta-structures\nare properties of meta-elements, i.e., sets of values adopted by mesoscopic\nstate variables describing collective, structural aspects of the collective\nphenomenon under study and related to a higher level of description\n(meta-description) suitable for dealing with coherence. Mesoscopic state\nvariables are abductively identified by the observer detecting emergent\nproperties, such as sets of suitably clustered distances, speed, directions,\ntheir ratios and ergodic properties of sets. Simulation software is under\nimplementation. We present four research projects based on such an approach\nable to give the reader the perspective applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2009 18:19:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-04"}

The spectrum of two such D7 $\\overline{\\rm D7}$ embeddings, contains\na single massive 4D meson coming from the world volume U(1) gauge field, the\npion, and a single massive 4D scalar meson coming from fluctuations of the\nembedding of the brane. In addition, there are continuum five dimensional\nstates due to the finite height of the effective potential in the radial\ndirection. We investigate baryons in this model, and find that the size is\nstabilized due to the Chern-Simons term in the D7 world volume action. The\nmodel admits a Hagedorn temperature of $\\frac{1}{2\\pi R}$ where $R$ is the\nradius parameter in the D5 branes metric. We investigate the pattern of chiral\nsymmetry breaking in the deconfined phase as a function of the asymptotic\nseparation of the branes $L$. We find that for $\\frac{\\pi}{3}R<L\\lessapprox\n1.068 R$ that chiral symmetry is restored, and that chiral symmetry is broken\nfor $L$ outside this window. We further argue that the solutions with\n$L<\\frac{\\pi}{3}$ are only classically stable, and in fact no D7 embedding\nexists with these boundary conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2009 21:44:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2009 16:34:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-07"}

We demonstrate an evolution in the strength of the radio\npower and the spectroscopic emission-lines typical of AGN, as well as in the\nmorphology of their hosts. Such evolution appears more substantial for less\nluminous systems, and is possibly the low-redshift tail of the downsizing in\nstar-formation, AGN activity and supermassive black hole build-up observed in\nhigher redshift surveys.This suggests that the differences in intrinsic\nproperties of galaxies along the Hubble Sequence may arise from the difference\nin the depth of their potential wells which leads to different evolutionary\npaths because of different timescales for gas infall. This primordial infall\nand the following secular evolution mediated by bar and density wave\ninstabilities may bring galaxies of different mass to have the different\nactivity levels and morphological features in the local universe shown in this\nstudy. In agreement with such a hypothesis, we find that star-formation as\ntraced by radio emission is progressively more centrally concentrated in more\nevolved star-forming galaxies and we show that the environment in which a\ngalaxy resides plays a lesser role in shaping the features and activity for the\nmajority of systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2009 22:02:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-25"}

The MIPS 160 micron image\nshows both extended emission from the Taurus cloud as well as emission from\nmultiple cold cores over a 1 X 2 deg region. Analysis shows that the cloud dust\ntemperature is 14.2 +- 0.4 K and the extinction ratio is A_160/A_K = 0.010 +-\n0.001 up to A_V ~ 4 mag. We find kappa_160 = 0.23 +- 0.046 cm^2/g for the\nspecific opacity of the gas-dust mixture. Therefore, for dust in the Taurus\ncloud we find the 160 um opacity is significantly higher than that measured for\nthe diffuse ISM, but not too different from dense cores, even at modest\nextinction values. Furthermore, the 160 um image shows features that do not\nappear in the IRAS 100 um image. We identify six regions as cold cores, i.e.\ncolder than 14.2 K, all of which have counterparts in extinction maps or C18O\nmaps.

Comparison of L1521F IRS with\ntheoretical simulations for the very early phases of star formation appears to\nrule out the first core collapse phase.

The quantum mechanical\nnon-localizability of the negatively charged Cooper pairs, which is protected\nfrom the localizing effect of decoherence by an energy gap, causes the pairs to\nundergo non-picturable, non-geodesic motion in the presence of a gravitational\nwave. This non-geodesic motion, which is accelerated motion through space,\nleads to the existence of mass and charge supercurrents inside the\nsuperconducting film. On the other hand, the decoherence-induced localizability\nof the positively charged ions in the lattice causes them to undergo\npicturable, geodesic motion as they are carried along with space in the\npresence of the same gravitational wave. The resulting separation of charges\nleads to a virtual plasma excitation within the film that enormously enhances\nits interaction with the wave, relative to that of a neutral superfluid or any\nnormal matter. The existence of strong mass supercurrents within a\nsuperconducting film in the presence of a gravitational wave, dubbed the\n\"Heisenberg-Coulomb effect,\" implies the specular reflection of a gravitational\nmicrowave from a film whose thickness is much less than the London penetration\ndepth of the material, in close analogy with the electromagnetic case.

Contrary to our earlier claim, the\nChandra analysis of NGC 5746, employing more recent calibration data, does not\nreveal any significant evidence for diffuse X-ray emission outside the optical\ndisk, with a 3-sigma upper limit to the halo X-ray luminosity of 4e39 erg/s. An\nidentical study of the less massive NGC 5170 also fails to detect any\nextraplanar X-ray emission. By extracting hot halo properties of disk galaxies\nformed in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, we compare these results to\nexpectations for cosmological accretion of hot gas by spirals. For Milky\nWay-sized galaxies, these high-resolution simulations predict hot halo X-ray\nluminosities which are lower by a factor of ~2 compared to our earlier results\nreported by Toft et al.

In this\npaper, we report the second-order assortative mixing in social networks. If two\nnodes are connected, we measure the degree correlation between their most\nprominent neighbours, rather than between the two nodes themselves. We observe\nvery strong second-order assortative mixing in social networks, often\nsignificantly stronger than the first-order assortative mixing. This suggests\nthat if two people interact in a social network, then the importance of the\nmost prominent person each knows is very likely to be the same.

The CAFFE model is an application of the theory of mixtures with\ncontinuous diversity for the case of large polar ice masses in which induced\nanisotropy occurs. The anisotropic response of the polycrystalline ice is\ndescribed by a generalization of Glen's flow law, based on a scalar anisotropic\nenhancement factor. The enhancement factor depends on the orientation mass\ndensity, which is closely related to the orientation distribution function and\ndescribes the distribution of grain orientations (fabric). Fabric evolution is\ngoverned by the orientation mass balance, which depends on four distinct\neffects, interpreted as local rigid body rotation, grain rotation, rotation\nrecrystallization (polygonization) and grain boundary migration (migration\nrecrystallization), respectively. It is proven that the flow law of the CAFFE\nmodel is truly anisotropic despite the collinearity between the stress deviator\nand stretching tensors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2009 04:10:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 May 2009 09:42:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2009 01:16:43 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2009 05:04:07 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 19 Mar 2010 03:55:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-22"}

We start by deriving a reduced PDE, the GGG model,\nconsisting of only wave-mode interactions. In principle, comparing this model\nto the full rotating Boussinesq system allows us to gauge the importance of\nwave-vortical-wave vs. wave-wave-wave interactions in determining the transfer\nand distribution of wave-mode energy. As in many atmosphere-ocean phenomena we\nwork in a skewed aspect ratio domain (H/L) with Fr = Ro < 1 such that Bu = 1.\nOur focus is on the equilibration of wave-mode energy and its spectral scaling\nunder the influence of random large-scale forcing. As anticipated, when forcing\nis applied to all modes, with Fr=Ro ~ 0.05 and H/L=1/5, the wave-mode energy\nequilibrates and its spectrum scales as a power-law. For the same parameters,\nwhen forcing is restricted to only wave modes, the energy fails to equilibrate\nin both the full system as well as the GGG subsystem at resolutions we can\nachieve. This cleary demonstrates the importance of the vortical mode in\ndetermining the wave-mode energy distribution. Proceeding to the second set of\nsimulations, i.e. for the larger Fr=Ro ~ 0.1 in a less skewed aspect ratio\ndomain with H/L=1/3, we observe that the energy of the GGG subsystem\nequilibrates. Further, the full system with forcing restricted to wave modes\nalso equilbrates and both yield identical energy spectra. Thus it is clear that\nthe wave-wave-wave interactions play a role in the overall dynamics at moderate\nRo, Fr and aspect ratios. Apart from theoretical concerns, these results\nhighlight the difficulty in properly resolving wave-mode interactions when\nsimulating realistic geophysical phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2009 04:53:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-05"}

Our picture capitalizes on an important element of the MHD\nrepresentation of the magnetosphere, namely the separatrix between the\ncorotating closed-line region (the `dead zone') and the open field lines that\noriginate in the polar caps. Along the separatrix flows the return current that\ncorresponds to the main magnetospheric electric current emanating from the\npolar caps. Across the separatrix, both the toroidal and poloidal components of\nthe magnetic field change discontinuously. The poloidal component discontinuity\nrequires the presence of a significant annular electric current which has up to\nnow been unaccounted for. We estimate the position and thickness of this\nannular current at the tip of the closed line region, and show that it consists\nof electrons (positrons) corotating with Lorentz factors on the order of 10^5,\nemitting incoherent synchrotron radiation that peaks in the hard X-rays.

The majority of this work consists of computational models of\nemotion recognition, computational modeling of causal factors of emotion and\nemotion expression through rendered and robotic faces. A smaller part is\nconcerned with modeling the effects of emotion, formal modeling of cognitive\nappraisal theory and models of emergent emotions. Part of the motivation for\naffective computing as a field is to better understand emotional processes\nthrough computational modeling. One of the four major topics in affective\ncomputing is computers that have emotions (the others are recognizing,\nexpressing and understanding emotions). A critical and neglected aspect of\nhaving emotions is the experience of emotion (Barrett, Mesquita, Ochsner, and\nGross, 2007): what does the content of an emotional episode look like, how does\nthis content change over time and when do we call the episode emotional. Few\nmodeling efforts have these topics as primary focus. The launch of a journal on\nsynthetic emotions should motivate research initiatives in this direction, and\nthis research should have a measurable impact on emotion research in\npsychology. I show that a good way to do so is to investigate the psychological\ncore of what an emotion is: an experience.

The quantum carry-lookahead adder is faster than a\nquantum ripple-carry adder; QCLA has logarithmic depth while ripple adders have\nlinear depth. MBQCLA utilizes MBQC's ability to transfer quantum states in unit\ntime to accelerate addition. MBQCLA breaks the latency limit of addition\ncircuits in nearest neighbor-only architectures : compared to the $\\Theta(n)$\nlimit on circuit depth for linear nearest-neighbor architectures, it can reach\n$\\Theta(log n)$ depth. MBQCLA is an order of magnitude faster than a\nripple-carry adder when adding registers longer than 100 qubits, but requires a\ncluster state that is an order of magnitude larger.

The aim of the study is to compare the NIR spectral properties of radio\ngalaxies to those of inactive early-type galaxies and, furthermore, produce the\nfirst NIR HK-band spectra for low redshift radio galaxies.

On average, EW(CO\n2.29) of radio galaxies is somewhat greater than that of inactive ellipticals.\nMost likely, EW(CO 2.29) is not significantly affected by dilution, and thus\nindicating that elliptical galaxies containing AGN are in a different stage in\ntheir evolution than inactive ellipticals. This is also supported by comparing\nother NIR features, such as CaI and NaI, with each other. Absorption features\nare consistent with the intermediate age stellar population, suggesting that\nhost galaxies contain both an old and intermediate age components. It is\nconsistent with previous optical spectroscopy studies which have shown evidence\non the intermediate age (~2 Gyr) stellar population of radio galaxies, and also\nin some of the early-type galaxies. The existence of intermediate age\npopulation is a link between the star formation episode, possibly induced by\ninteraction or merging event, and the triggering of the nuclear activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2009 13:30:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Effective pseudoscalar-photon interaction(s) would\ninduce a rotation of linear polarization of electromagnetic wave propagating\nwith cosmological distance in various cosmological models. CMB polarization\nobservations are superb tests of these models and have the potential to\ndiscover new fundamental physics. Pseudoscalar-photon interaction is\nproportional to the gradient of the pseudoscalar field. From phenomenological\npoint of view, this gradient could be neutrino number asymmetry, other density\ncurrent, or a constant vector. In these situations, Lorentz invariance or CPT\nmay effectively be violated.

Dedicated CMB\npolarization observers like B-Pol mission, CMBpol mission and LiteBIRD mission\nwould probe this fundamental issue more deeply in the future. With these\nsensitivities, cosmic polarization rotations from effective pseudoscalar-photon\ninteraction, Faraday polarization rotations from primordial and large-scale\nmagnetic field, and tensor modes effects would have chances to be detected and\ndistinguished.

We compute\n$RFH_*(ST^*L,T^*L)$, where $ST^*L$ is the unit cosphere bundle of a closed\nmanifold $L$. As an application, we prove that the image of an exact contact\nembedding of $ST^*L$ (endowed with the standard contact structure) cannot be\ndisplaced away from itself by a Hamiltonian isotopy, provided $\\dim L\\ge 4$ and\nthe embedding induces an injection on $\\pi_1$.

Observation of these effects will provide direct information\non the single-particle states in the heaviest nuclear mass region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2009 15:59:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-28"}
