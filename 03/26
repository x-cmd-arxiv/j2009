We show that color corrections are, in general, expected to be\nbiased. In addition, color excesses which do not add a significant scatter to\nthe observed SN brightnesses affect the value of cosmological parameters but\nleave the slope of the color-luminosity relation unchanged.\n  We quantify these biases in the context of the redshift-dependent dust\nextinction suggested by the recent detection of intergalactic dust by Menard et\nal.

Using a range of models for the opacity of the Universe as a\nfunction of redshift, we find that color-magnitude-stretch scaling relations\nare virtually insensitive to the presence of cosmic dust while cosmological\nparameters such as Omega_M and w are biased at the level of a few percent, i.e.\noffsets comparable to the current statistical errors.\n  Future surveys will be able to limit the impact of intergalactic extinction\nby observing at larger wavelengths. In addition such datasets will provide\ndirect detections of intergalactic dust by cross-correlating SN colors and the\ndensity of foreground galaxies, which can be used as a consistency check on the\ncosmic dust extinction correction. Alternatively, such biases could be avoided\nby correcting the colors of supernovae on an object-by-object basis with\naccurate photometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2009 19:46:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Mar 2009 07:36:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Binary search\ntrees and suffix trees (ST) are data structures that have been often used for\nthis purpose, as they allow fast searches at the expense of memory usage.\n  In recent years, there has been interest on suffix arrays (SA), due to their\nsimplicity and low memory requirements. One key issue is that an SA can solve\nthe sub-string problem almost as efficiently as an ST, using less memory. This\npaper proposes two new SA-based algorithms for LZ encoding, which require no\nmodifications on the decoder side. Experimental results on standard benchmarks\nshow that our algorithms, though not faster, use 3 to 5 times less memory than\nthe ST counterparts. Another important feature of our SA-based algorithms is\nthat the amount of memory is independent of the text to search, thus the memory\nthat has to be allocated can be defined a priori. These features of low and\npredictable memory requirements are of the utmost importance in several\nscenarios, such as embedded systems, where memory is at a premium and speed is\nnot critical. Finally, we point out that the new algorithms are general, in the\nsense that they are adequate for applications other than LZ compression, such\nas text retrieval and forward/backward sub-string search.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2009 19:25:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

Simply by\nvirtue of not being flat, curved space geometries have to possess intrinsic\nlength scales, and such length scales can affect the fluid structure. For modes\nof wavelength of order or greater than such scales eikonalized geometrical\noptics cannot apply and rays are not geodesic. Covariantizing thus entails not\nonly the replacing of flat space functions by covariant ones, but also the\nintroduction of intrinsic scales that were absent in flat space. In principle\nit is thus unreliable to construct the curved space energy-momentum tensor as\nthe covariant generalization of a geodesic-based flat spacetime energy-momentum\ntensor. By constructing the partition function as an incoherent average over a\ncomplete set of modes of a scalar field propagating in a curved space\nbackground, we show that for the specific case of a static, spherically\nsymmetric geometry, the steady state energy-momentum tensor that ensues will in\ngeneral be of the form\n$T_{\\mu\\nu}=(\\rho+p)U_{\\mu}U_{\\nu}+pg_{\\mu\\nu}+\\pi_{\\mu\\nu}$ where the\nanisotropic $\\pi_{\\mu\\nu}$ is a symmetric, traceless rank two tensor which\nobeys $U^{\\mu}\\pi_{\\mu\\nu}=0$. Such a $\\pi_{\\mu\\nu}$ type term is absent for an\nincoherently averaged steady state fluid in a spacetime where there are no\nintrinsic length scales, and in principle would thus be missed in a\ncovariantizing of a flat spacetime $T_{\\mu\\nu}$. While the significance of such\n$\\pi_{\\mu\\nu}$ type terms would need to be evaluated on a case by case basis,\nthrough the use of kinetic theory we reassuringly find that the effect of such\n$\\pi_{\\mu\\nu}$ type terms is small for weak gravity stars where perfect fluid\nsources are commonly used.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2009 16:08:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 2010 16:29:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Important intermediate age (1-5 Gyr) populations, and frequently\ntails of star formation until recent times are detected. These histories are\nreminiscent of their lower mass dSph counterparts of the Local Group. Most\ngalaxies (10/16) show significant metallicity gradients, with metallicity\ndeclining by 0.5 dex over one half-light radius on average. These gradients are\nalready present in the old population. The flattened (or discy), rotating\nobjects (6/16) have flat metallicity profiles.

The main emphasis\nis put on obtaining a reliable analytical estimate for the transition\ntemperature into the excitonic state. As in a double-layer graphene system the\ntotal number of fermionic \"flavors\" is equal to N=8 due to two projections of\nspin, two valleys, and two layers, the large-$N$ approximation appears to be\nespecially suitable for theoretical investigation of the system. On the other\nhand, the large number of flavors makes screening of the bare Coulomb\ninteractions very efficient, which, together with the suppression of\nbackscattering in graphene, leads to an extremely low energy of the excitonic\ncondensation. It is shown that the effect of screening on the excitonic pairing\nis just as strong in the excitonic state as it is in the normal state. As a\nresult, the value of the excitonic gap $\\De$ is found to be in full agreement\nwith the previously obtained estimate for the mean-field transition temperature\n$T_c$, the maximum possible value $\\Delta^{\\rm max},T_c^{\\rm max}\\sim 10^{-7}\n\\epsilon_F$ ($\\epsilon_F$ is the Fermi energy) of both being in $ 1{\\rm mK}$\nrange for a perfectly clean system. This proves that the energy scale $\\sim\n10^{-7} \\epsilon_F$ really sets the upper bound for the transition temperature\nand invalidates the recently expressed conjecture about the high-temperature\nfirst-order transition into the excitonic state. These findings suggest that,\nunfortunately, the excitonic condensation in graphene double-layers can hardly\nbe realized experimentally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2009 21:18:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-29"}

We use the AMES-COND cloudless solar\nmetallicity models provided by the PHOENIX code to match the spectra of the T\ndwarfs observed with the NIR high-resolution spectrograph NIRSPEC using ten\nechelle orders to cover part of the J band from 1.165 to 1.323 microns with\nR~20,000. The projected rotational velocity, Teff and logg of the objects are\ndetermined based on the minimum RMS of the differences between the modelled and\nobserved relative fluxes. The modelled spectra reproduce quite well the\nobserved features for most of the T dwarfs, with Teff in the range of 922-1009\nK, and logg between 4.3 and 5 (cm s^-2). Our results support the assumption of\na dust free atmosphere for T dwarfs later than T5, where dust grains form and\nthen gravitationally sediment into the low atmosphere. The modelled spectra do\nnot accurately mimic some individual very strong lines like the KI doublet at\n1.2436 and 1.2525 microns. Our modelled spectra does not match well the\nobserved spectra of the two T dwarfs with earlier spectral types, namely SDSSp\nJ125453.90-012247.4 (T2) and 2MASS J05591914-1404488 (T4.5), which is likely\ndue to the presence of condensate clouds that are not incorporated in the\nmodels used here. By comparing our results and their uncertainties to\nevolutionary models, we estimate masses in the interval ~5-75 MJ for T dwarfs\nlater than T5, which are in good agreement with those found in the literature.\nWe found apparent young ages that are typically between 0.1 and a few Gyr for\nthe same T dwarfs, which is consistent with recent kinematical studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2009 20:31:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The\npresent work reports EXAFS measurements that address the substituent atom\ndistribution as a function of T, M, and x, near the superconducting phase.\nTogether with previous measurements for M=Sn, the proportion of the M atom\nresiding on the In(1) site, f{In(1)}, increases in the order M=Cd, Sn, and Hg,\nranging from about 40% to 70%, showing a strong preference for these\nsubstituents to occupy the In(1) site (random=20%). In addition, f{In(1)}\nranges from 70% to 100% for M=Hg in the order T=Co, Rh, and Ir. These fractions\ntrack the changes in the atomic radii of the various species, and help explain\nthe sharp dependence of Tc on substituting into the In site.

This definition, in turn, leads to\na method allowing to distinguish in principle tetraquark and molecular states.\nThe different concept of `dynamical reconstruction' is also introduced and\napplies to the generation of preexisting mesons (quark-antiquark, glueballs,\n>...) via unitarization methods applied to low-energy effective Lagrangians.\nLarge $N_{c}$ arguments play an important role in all these investigations. A\nsimple toy model with two scalar fields is introduced to elucidate these\nconcepts. The large $N_{c}$ behavior of the parameters is chosen in order that\nthe two scalar fields behave as quark-antiquark mesons. When the heavier field\nis integrated out, one is left with an effective Lagrangian with the lighter\nfield only. A unitarization method applied to the latter allows to\n`reconstruct' the heavier `quarkonium-like' field, which was previously\nintegrated out. It is shown that a Bethe-Salpeter (BS) analysis is capable to\nreproduce the preformed quark-antiquark state. However, when only the lowest\nterm of the effective Lagrangian is retained, the large $N_{c}$ limit of the\nreconstructed state is not reproduced: instead of the correct large $N_{c}$\nquarkonium limit, it fades out as a molecular state would do. Implications of\nthese results are presented: it is proposed that axial-vector, tensor and\n(some) scalar mesons just above 1 GeV obtained via the BS approach from the\ncorresponding low-energy, effective Lagrangian in which only the lowest term is\nkept, are quarkonia states, in agreement with the constituent quark model,\nalthough they might fade away as molecular states in the large $N_{c}$ limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2009 22:00:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 6 Dec 2009 15:31:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-07"}

Assuming that the peak\nluminosity correlates with the post-merger halo mass, we convolve the light\ncurve with the triggering rate of quasar activity to predict the quasar\nluminosity function (LF). Our model reproduces the observed LF at 0.5<z<4.5 for\nthe full luminosity ranges probed by current optical and X-ray surveys. Our\nmodel reproduces both the observed redshift evolution and luminosity dependence\nof the linear bias of quasar/AGN clustering.

There is demonstrated evidence that STEM fields benefit from\ndiverse perspectives on problems that require more complex thought processes.\nThis is especially relevant to a field like astronomy where more and more work\nis being done collaboratively. The lack of notable growth in African American,\nHispanic, and Native American representation in astronomy indicates that the\n'pipeline' for these individuals is systemically leaky at critical junctures.\nSubstantially more effort must be directed toward improving the educational and\ncareer development of minorities to insure that these potential colleagues are\nsupported through the process.

The\ncase of FDPC with positive definite (p.d.) input covariance matrix was studied\nby the authors in a recent paper, and here the more general case of positive\nsemi-definite (p.s.d.) input covariance is dealt with. Towards this end, the\nchoice of auxiliary random variable is modified. The algorithms for\ndetermination of inflation factor proposed in the p.d. case are then\ngeneralized to the case of p.s.d. input covariance. Subsequently, the largest\nDPC-achievable high-SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) scaling factor over the no-CSIT\nFDPC with p.s.d. input covariance matrix is derived. This scaling factor is\nseen to be a non-trivial generalization of the one achieved for the p.d. case.\nNext, in the limit of low SNR, it is proved that the choice of all-zero\ninflation factor (thus treating interference as noise) is optimal in the\n'ratio' sense, regardless of the covariance matrix used. Further, in the p.d.\ncovariance case, the inflation factor optimal at high SNR is obtained when the\nnumber of transmit antennas is greater than the number of receive antennas,\nwith the other case having been already considered in the earlier paper.\nFinally, the problem of joint optimization of the input covariance matrix and\nthe inflation factor is dealt with, and an iterative numerical algorithm is\ndeveloped.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2009 07:55:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-27"}

We associate this effect with the electronic\nphase separation, previously observed in the same material, and with the effect\nof lattice softening below the magnetic phase transition. We employ density\nfunctional theory to evaluate the distribution of atomic positions in the\npresence of dopant atoms both in the normal and magnetic states, and to\nquantify the lattice softening, showing that it can account for a major part of\nthe observed increase of the microstrain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2009 12:29:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-05"}

METHODS: CCD time\nseries photometry in the Johnson V filter has been obtained for a total of\n145.7 h of observations distributed over 36 nights. The resulting light curves\nhave been subjected to a detailed frequency analysis using updated numerical\ntechniques. Photometric and spectroscopic data have also been acquired to\ndetermine reliable estimates of the stellar properties.

Each halo is resolved with ~ 10^8 particles (at a mass\nresolution ~ 10^3-4 M_sun/h) within its virial radius. Subhaloes with masses\nlarger than 10^5 M_sun/h are well resolved, an improvement of at least two\norders of magnitude over previous lensing studies. We incorporate a baryonic\ncomponent modelled as a Hernquist profile and account for the response of the\ndark matter via adiabatic contraction. We focus on the \"anomalous\" flux ratio\nproblem, in particular on the violation of the cusp-caustic relation due to\nsubstructures. We find that subhaloes with masses less than ~ 10^8 M_sun/h play\nan important role in causing flux anomalies; such low mass subhaloes have been\nunresolved in previous studies. There is large scatter in the predicted flux\nratios between different haloes and between different projections of the same\nhalo. In some cases, the frequency of predicted anomalous flux ratios is\ncomparable to that observed for the radio lenses, although in most cases it is\nnot. The probability for the simulations to reproduce the observed violations\nof the cusp lenses is about 0.001. We therefore conclude that the amount of\nsubstructure in the central regions of the Aquarius haloes is insufficient to\nexplain the observed frequency of violations of the cusp-caustic relation.\nThese conclusions are based purely on our dark matter simulations which ignore\nthe effect of baryons on subhalo survivability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2009 12:19:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2009 16:26:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

This\npolicy, however, often requires the solution of an NP-hard optimization\nproblem. This has motivated many researchers to develop sub-optimal algorithms\nthat approximate the GMWM policy in selecting schedule vectors. One implicit\nassumption commonly shared in this context is that during the algorithm\nruntime, the channel states remain effectively unchanged. This assumption may\nnot hold as the time needed to select near-optimal schedule vectors usually\nincreases quickly with the network size. In this paper, we incorporate channel\nvariations and the time-efficiency of sub-optimal algorithms into the scheduler\ndesign, to dynamically tune the algorithm runtime considering the tradeoff\nbetween algorithm efficiency and its robustness to changing channel states.\nSpecifically, we propose a Dynamic Control Policy (DCP) that operates on top of\na given sub-optimal algorithm, and dynamically but in a large time-scale\nadjusts the time given to the algorithm according to queue backlog and channel\ncorrelations. This policy does not require knowledge of the structure of the\ngiven sub-optimal algorithm, and with low overhead can be implemented in a\ndistributed manner. Using a novel Lyapunov analysis, we characterize the\nthroughput stability region induced by DCP and show that our characterization\ncan be tight. We also show that the throughput stability region of DCP is at\nleast as large as that of any other static policy. Finally, we provide two case\nstudies to gain further intuition into the performance of DCP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2009 14:19:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

The contributions to the pressure arise from the hard\nmomentum scale of order $T$ and the soft momentum scale of order $gT$.\nEffective field theory methods and dimensional reduction are used to separate\nthe contributions from the two momentum scales: The hard contribution can be\ncalculated as a power series in $g^2$ using naive perturbation theory with bare\npropagators. The soft contribution can be calculated using an effective theory\nin three dimensions, whose coefficients are power series in $g^2$. This\ncontribution is a power series in $g$ starting at order $g^3$. The calculation\nof the hard part to order $g^6$ involves a complicated four-loop sum-integral\nthat was recently calculated by Gynther, Laine, Schr\\\"oder, Torrero, and\nVuorinen.

We show that complementing the HHT with techniques such as\nzero-phase filtering, kernel density estimation and Fourier analysis allows it\nto be used effectively to detect and characterize signals with low signal to\nnoise ratio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2009 15:41:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-22"}

A\nConley type decomposition theorem is proved for nonautonomous dynamical systems\ndefined on a non-compact but separable state space. Namely, the state space can\nbe decomposed into a chain recurrent part and a gradient-like part. This result\napplies to both nonautonomous ordinary differential equations on Euclidean\nspace (which is only locally compact), and nonautonomous partial differential\nequations on infinite dimensional function space (which is not even locally\ncompact). This decomposition result is demonstrated by discussing a few\nconcrete examples, such as the Lorenz system and the Navier-Stokes system,\nunder time-dependent forcing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2009 15:45:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-27"}

We show that the multi-shell\novergrowth of a free-standing nanowire, together with the prismatic symmetry of\nthe substrate, may induce quantum confinement of carriers in a set of quasi-1D\nquantum channels corresponding to the nanowire edges. Localization and\ninter-channel tunnel coupling are controlled by the curvature at the edges and\nthe diameter of the underlying nanowire. We also show that a magnetic field may\ninduce either Aharonov-Bohm oscillations of the energy levels in the axial\nconfiguration, or a dimensional transition of the quantum states from quasi-1D\nto Landau levels for fields normal to the axis. Explicit predictions are given\nfor nanostructures based on GaAs, InAs, and InGaN with different symmetries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2009 15:50:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-09"}
