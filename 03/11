The requirements needed to map qubit\nand continuous variable states of cavity or traveling-wave fields to the\ncollective nuclear spin are investigated: For cavity fields, we consider\nadiabatic passage processes to transfer the states.

The code includes magnetic field effects in an\napproximate manner: magnetic pressure, tension, braking, and ambipolar\ndiffusion are all modelled. The parameters varied for both the initially\nprolate and oblate clouds are the initial degree of central concentration of\nthe radial density profile, the initial angular velocity, and the efficiency of\nmagnetic braking (represented by a factor $f_{mb} = 10^{-4}$ or $10^{-3}$). The\noblate cores all collapse to form rings that might be susceptible to\nfragmentation into multiple systems. The outcome of the collapse of the prolate\ncores depends strongly on the initial density profile. Prolate cores with\ncentral densities 20 times higher than their boundary densities collapse and\nfragment into binary or quadruple systems, whereas cores with central densities\n100 times higher collapse to form single protostars embedded in bars. The\ninclusion of magnetic braking is able to stifle protostellar fragmentation in\nthe latter set of models, as when identical models were calculated without\nmagnetic braking (Boss 2002), those cores fragmented into binary protostars.\nThese models demonstrate the importance of including magnetic fields in studies\nof protostellar collapse and fragmentation, and suggest that even when magnetic\nfields are included, fragmentation into binary and multiple systems remains as\na possible outcome of protostellar collapse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2009 16:25:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-15"}

Precisely speaking, the above self-assemblies tile completely\nfilled-in, two-dimensional regions of the plane, with labeled subsets of these\ntiles representing discrete Sierpinski triangles.

This work reconciles the apparent\ndiscrepancy between observed 2D and 3D DNA elastic properties and points out\nthat conclusions about the 3D properties of DNA (and its companion proteins and\nenzymes) do not directly follow from 2D experiments by AFM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2009 17:46:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-22"}

These are detection and characterization of\n3-dimensional brightness temperature fluctuations in the 21cm line of neutral\nhydrogen during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) at redshifts from 6 to 10,\nsolar imaging and remote sensing of the inner heliosphere via propagation\neffects on signals from distant background sources,and high-sensitivity\nexploration of the variable radio sky. The array design features 8192\ndual-polarization broad-band active dipoles, arranged into 512 tiles comprising\n16 dipoles each. The tiles are quasi-randomly distributed over an aperture\n1.5km in diameter, with a small number of outliers extending to 3km. All\ntile-tile baselines are correlated in custom FPGA-based hardware, yielding a\nNyquist-sampled instantaneous monochromatic uv coverage and unprecedented point\nspread function (PSF) quality. The correlated data are calibrated in real time\nusing novel position-dependent self-calibration algorithms. The array is\nlocated in the Murchison region of outback Western Australia.

Analysis of the pipeline\nreduced CoRoT light curve yields a new determination of the physical and\norbital parameters of planet and star, along with 35 individual transit times\nat a typical precision of 36 s. I estimate a planet-to-star radii ratio of\n0.1433 +/- 0.0010, a ratio of the planet's orbital semimajor axis to the host\nstar radius of 4.751 +/- 0.045, and an orbital inclination for the planet of\n83.88 +/- 0.29 deg. The observed transit times are consistent with CoRoT-1b\nhaving a constant period and there is no evidence of an additional planet in\nthe system. I use the observed constancy of the transit times to set limits on\nthe mass of a hypothetical additional planet in a nearby, stable orbit. I\nascertain that the most stringent limits (4 M_earth at 3 sigma confidence) can\nbe placed on planets residing in a 1:2 mean motion resonance with the\ntransiting planet. In contrast, the data yield less stringent limits on planets\nnear a 1:3 mean motion resonance (5 M_jup at 3 sigma confidence) than in the\nsurrounding parameter space. In addition, I use a simulation to investigate\nwhat sensitivity to additional planets could be obtained from the analysis of\ndata measured for a similar system during a CoRoT long run (100 sequential\ntransit times). I find that for such a scenario, planets with masses greater\nthan twice that of Mars (0.2 M_earth) in the 1:2 mean motion resonance would\ncause high-significance transit time deviations. Therefore, such planets could\nbe detected or ruled out using CoRoT long run data. I conclude that CoRoT data\nwill indeed be very useful for searching for planets with the transit timing\nmethod.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2009 20:10:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 May 2009 13:15:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The\ncoefficient B was suggested to be universal in the arguments of colour glass\ncondensate (CGC) of QCD in recent years. There has been, however, no rigorous\nproof yet based only on QCD.

For\nBoussinesq fluids with a linear equation of state, this link is simply\nW_{r,turbulent}=D(APE), widely interpreted as implying that GPE_r increases at\nthe expense of APE, in contrast with the laminar case where GPE_r increases at\nthe expense of internal energy (IE). This idea is revisited here by regarding\nIE as the sum of three distinct subcomponents: available internal energy (AIE),\nexergy (IE_{exergy}), and dead internal energy (IE_0). In this new view, D(APE)\nis the dissipation rate of APE into IE_0, while both W_{r,laminar} and\nW_{r,turbulent} convert IE_{exergy} into GPE_r. The equality\nW_{r,turbulent}=D(APE) thus states that IE_{exergy} is converted into GPE_r at\nthe same rate as APE is dissipated into IE_0. For non-Boussinesq fluids, the\nequality D(APE)=W_{r,turbulent} is at best a good approximation, for\nW_{r,turbulent} is generally smaller than D(APE), and sometimes even negative\nfor a strongly nonlinear equation of state. In a second step, the link between\nstirring and mixing is examined for a wind-and buoyancy-driven thermally\nstratified ocean to determine whether these constrain the mechanical sources of\nstirring, as recently advocated. It is established that the coupling between\nstirring and mixing cannot refute the traditional buoyancy-driven view of the\nso-called meridional overturning circulation, in contrast to recent claims. In\nfact, the buoyancy forcing appears to be as important as the mechanical forcing\nin stirring and driving the large-scale ocean circulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2009 09:56:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2009 07:03:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2009 14:26:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Math. Phys., 281\n(2008), pp. 129-177), we have rigorously derived, by means of bulk limit\narguments, a new variational model to describe the electronic ground state of\ninsulating or semiconducting crystals in the presence of local defects. In this\nso-called reduced Hartree-Fock model, the ground state electronic density\nmatrix is decomposed as $\\gamma = \\gamma^0_{\\rm per} + Q_{\\nu,\\epsilon_{\\rm\nF}}$, where $\\gamma^0_{\\rm per}$ is the ground state density matrix of the host\ncrystal and $Q_{\\nu,\\epsilon_{\\rm F}}$ the modification of the electronic\ndensity matrix generated by a modification $\\nu$ of the nuclear charge of the\nhost crystal, the Fermi level $\\epsilon_{\\rm F}$ being kept fixed. The purpose\nof the present article is twofold. First, we study more in details the\nmathematical properties of the density matrix $Q_{\\nu,\\epsilon_{\\rm F}}$ (which\nis known to be a self-adjoint Hilbert-Schmidt operator on $L^2(\\R^3)$). We show\nin particular that if $\\int_{\\RR^3} \\nu \\neq 0$, $Q_{\\nu,\\epsilon_{\\rm F}}$ is\nnot trace-class. Moreover, the associated density of charge is not in\n$L^1(\\R^3)$ if the crystal exhibits anisotropic dielectric properties. These\nresults are obtained by analyzing, for a small defect $\\nu$, the linear and\nnonlinear terms of the resolvent expansion of $Q_{\\nu,\\epsilon_{\\rm F}}$.\nSecond, we show that, after an appropriate rescaling, the potential generated\nby the microscopic total charge (nuclear plus electronic contributions) of the\ncrystal in the presence of the defect, converges to a homogenized electrostatic\npotential solution to a Poisson equation involving the macroscopic dielectric\npermittivity of the crystal. This provides an alternative (and rigorous)\nderivation of the Adler-Wiser formula.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2009 10:27:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

It is proved that the\ngravity field of mass thin disc distribution is greatly different from that of\nspherically symmetrical distribution. As long as the Newtonian theory of\ngravity is used strictly, by the proper mass distributions of thin discs, the\nflat rotation curves of whirlpool galaxies can be explained well. The rotating\ncurve of the Milky Galaxy is obtained which coincides with practical\nobservation. In this way, it is unnecessary for us to suppose the existence of\nadditional dark material in the illuminant discs of whirlpool galaxy again.\nMeanwhile, in the space outside the illuminant disc, the quantity of dark\nmaterial needed to maintain the flatness of rotation curves is greatly\ndecreased. By considering the observation fact that the quantity of\nnon-luminous baryon material is 3~10 times more than luminous material, we can\nexplain the flatness of rotation curves of whirlpool galaxies well without the\nhypotheses of non-baryon dark material. So it is unnecessary for us to suppose\nthat non-baryon dark material is about 5 times more than baryon material in a\nsingle whirlpool galaxy, no mater whether non-baryon dark material exits or\nnot.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2009 12:36:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-12"}

Although the available\nmass for accretion increases with radial distance (a) for disk solid surface\ndensity (sigma) functions sigma=sigma_0*a^(-alpha) with alpha < 2, the\naccretion timescale is significantly longer at larger radial distances.\nEfficient accretion is limited to the first ~ 1E5 years of planetary evolution,\nwhen the planet is extended and before gap opening and type II migration take\nplace. The accreted mass is calculated for disk masses of 0.01, 0.05 and 0.1\nM_sun with alpha = 1/2, 1, and 3/2. We show that a Jupiter-mass protoplanet can\naccrete 1 to 110 M_earth of heavy elements, depending on the disk properties.\nOur results explain the large variation in heavy element enrichment found in\nextra-solar giant planets. Since higher disk surface density is found to lead\nto larger heavy element enrichment, our model results are consistent with the\ncorrelation between heavy element enrichment and stellar metallicity. Our\ncalculations also suggest that Jupiter could have formed at a larger radial\ndistance than its current location while still accreting the mass of heavy\nelements predicted by interior models. We conclude that in the disk instability\nmodel the final composition of a giant planet is strongly determined by its\nformation environment.
