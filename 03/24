This paper discusses the expected neutrino-induced\nbackground spectrum due to several of the most important sources, including\nsolar, atmospheric, and diffuse supernova neutrinos. The largest rate arises\nfrom $^8$B produced solar neutrinos, providing upwards of $\\sim 10^3$ events\nper ton-year over all recoil energies for the heaviest nuclear targets. However\nthe majority of these $^8$B events are expected to be below the recoil\nthreshold of modern detectors. The remaining neutrino sources are found to\nconstitute a background to the WIMP-induced recoil rate only if the\nWIMP-nucleon cross section is less than $10^{-12}$ pb. Finally the sensitivity\nto diffuse supernova neutrino flux for non-electron neutrino flavors is\ndiscussed, and projected flux limits are compared with existing flux limits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2009 19:37:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2009 17:02:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

Two\npopular board shapes are the 33-hole cross-shaped board, and the 15-hole\ntriangle board---we use them as examples throughout. The basic game begins from\na full board with one peg missing and the goal is to finish at a board position\nwith one peg. First, we discuss ways to solve the basic game on a computer.\nThen we consider the problem of quickly distinguishing board positions where\nthe goal can still be reached (\"winning\" board positions) from those where it\ncannot. This enables a computer to alert the player if a jump under\nconsideration leads to a dead end. On the 15-hole triangle board, it is\npossible to identify all winning board positions (from any single vacancy\nstart) by storing a key set of 437 board positions. For the \"central game\" on\nthe 33-hole cross-shaped board, we can identify all winning board positions by\nstoring 839,536 board positions. By viewing a successful game as a traversal of\na directed graph of winning board positions, we apply a simple algorithm to\ncount the number of ways to traverse this graph, and calculate that the total\nnumber of solutions to the central game is 40,861,647,040,079,968. Our analysis\ncan also determine how quickly we can reach a \"dead board position\", where a\none peg finish is no longer possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2009 18:55:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2011 05:52:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 10 Apr 2011 15:39:26 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 6 Nov 2014 17:19:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-07"}

In the absence of perfectly known\ngalaxy redshifts some modeling of the galaxy intrinsic alignments is likely to\nbe required to extract the lensing signal to sufficient accuracy. We present a\nnew model based on the placement of galaxies into dark matter halos. The\ncentral galaxy ellipticity follows the large scale potential and, in the\nsimplest case, the satellite galaxies point at the halo center. The two-halo\nterm is then dominated by the linear alignment model and the one-halo term\nprovides a motivated extension of intrinsic alignment models to small scales.\nWe provide fitting formulae for the spatial projected source power spectra for\nboth intrinsic-intrinsic (II) and shear-intrinsic (GI) correlations. We\nillustrate the potential impact of ignoring intrinsic alignments on\ncosmological parameter constraints from non-tomographic surveys, finding that\nsigma_8 could be underestimated by up to the size of the current 1-sigma error\nbar from cosmic shear if very small scales are included in the analysis.\nFinally, we highlight areas of interest for numerical simulations of dark\nmatter clustering and galaxy formation that can further constrain the intrinsic\nalignment signal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2009 17:45:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

A critical\nelement for proving or refuting this hypothesis is the existence of hot, very\nfaint plasmas which should be at amounts predicted by impulsive heating. We\nreport on the first comprehensive spectroscopic study of hot plasmas in active\nregions. Data from the EIS spectrometer on Hinode were used to construct\nemission measure distributions in quiescent active regions in the 1-5 MK\ntemperature range. The distributions are flat or slowly increasing up to\napproximately 3 MK and then fall off rapidly at higher temperatures.

A small difference of bias voltage between\nthe two side gates (SGs) leads to an inversion asymmetry in the LSOC between\nthe opposite edges of the channel. In single electron modeling of transport,\nthis triggers a spontaneous but insignificant spin polarization in the QPC.\nHowever, the spin polarization of the QPC is enhanced substantially when the\neffect of electron-electron interaction is included. The spin polarization is\nstrong enough to result in the occurrence of a conductance plateau at 0.5G0 (G0\n= 2e2/h) in the absence of any external magnetic field. In our simulations of a\nmodel QPC device, the 0.5 plateau is found to be quite robust and survives up\nto a temperature of 40K. The spontaneous spin polarization and the resulting\nmagnetization of the QPC can be reversed by flipping the polarity of the source\nto drain bias or the potential difference between the two SGs.

The\npolarization and flux density in both the optical waveband and the 43 GHz\ncompact core increased by a small amount in late 2005, and increased\nsignificantly along with the near-IR polarization and flux density over the\ncourse of 10 days in early 2006.

At 43 GHz, the EVPA\nof the blazar core is perpendicular to the flow of the jet, while the EVPAs of\nemerging superluminal knots are aligned parallel to the jet axis. The core\npolarization is that expected if shear aligns the magnetic field at the\nboundary between flows of disparate velocities within the jet.

The observed flux density and polarization\nvariations are then compatible with changes in the direction of the inner jet\ncaused by a temporary change in the position of the core if the spine contains\nwiggles owing to an instability.

This has led to the development of\nself-regulated models for BH growth, in which feedback from the central BH\nhalts its own growth upon reaching a critical threshold. However, models have\nalso been proposed in which feedback plays no role: so long as a fixed fraction\nof the host gas supply is accreted, relations like those observed can be\nreproduced. Here, we argue that the scatter in the observed BH-host\ncorrelations, and its run with scale, presents a demanding constraint on any\nmodel for these correlations, and that it favors self-regulated models of BH\ngrowth. We show that the scatter in the stellar mass fraction within a radius R\nin observed ellipticals and spheroids increases strongly at small R. At fixed\ntotal stellar mass (or host velocity dispersion), on very small scales near the\nBH radius of influence, there is an order-of-magnitude scatter in the amount of\ngas that must have entered and formed stars. In short, the BH appears to 'know\nmore' about the global host galaxy potential on large scales than the stars and\ngas supply on small scales. This is predicted in self-regulated models;\nhowever, models where there is no feedback would generically predict\norder-of-magnitude scatter in the BH-host correlations. Likewise, models in\nwhich the BH feedback in the 'bright' mode does not regulate the growth of the\nBH itself, but sets the stellar mass of the galaxy by inducing star formation\nor blowing out a mass in gas much larger than the galaxy stellar mass, are\ndifficult to reconcile with the scatter on small scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2009 20:04:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2009 20:33:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

These objects complement a previously investigated sample of 108\nUV-luminous galaxies at similar redshifts, selected from the FDF spectroscopic\nsurvey, the K20 survey, and the GDDS. The shape of the UV extinction curve is\nconstrained by a parametric description of the rest-frame UV continuum. The UV\nbump is further characterised by fitting Lorentzian-like profiles. Spectra\nexhibit a significant 2175A feature in at least 30% of the cases. If\nattenuation is dominated by dust ejected from the galaxy main body via\nsuperwinds, UV extinction curves in-between those of the SMC and LMC\ncharacterise the sample galaxies. The fraction of galaxies with extinction\ncurves differing from the SMC one increases, if more dust resides in the\ngalactic plane or dust attenuation depends on stellar age. On average, the\nwidth of the manifested UV bumps is about 60% of the values typical of the LMC\nand Milky Way. This suggests the presence of dust similar to that found in the\nLMC2 supershell close to 30Dor. The presence of the carriers of the UV bump at\n1<z<2.5 argues for outflows from AGB stars being copious then. Consistent with\ntheir higher SFRs, the GMASS galaxies with a manifested UV bump are more\nluminous at rest-frame 8mum, where the emission is dominated by PAHs (also\nproducts of AGB stars). In addition, they exhibit stronger UV absorption\nfeatures, mostly of interstellar origin, which indicates overall more evolved\nstellar populations. We conclude that diversification of the small-size dust\ncomponent has already started in the most evolved star-forming systems at\n1<z<2.5.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2009 15:00:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 2009 13:32:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

This\nmodel suffers two deficiencies: (a) it does not account for experimental\nentropy differences of 2% among elemental liquids, and (b) it implies a value\nof zero for the transit contribution to internal energy. The purpose of this\npaper is to correct these deficiencies. To this end, the V-T equation for\nentropy is fitted to an overall accuracy of 0.1% to the available experimental\nhigh temperature entropy data for elemental liquids. The theory contains two\nnuclear motion contributions: (a) the dominant vibrational contribution\nS_{vib}(T/\\theta_0), where T is temperature and \\theta_0 is the vibrational\ncharacteristic temperature, and (b) the transit contribution\nS_{tr}(T/\\theta_{tr}), where \\theta_{tr} is a scaling temperature for each\nliquid. The appearance of a common functional form of S_{tr} for all the\nliquids studied is a property of the experimental data, when analyzed via the\nV-T formula. The resulting S_{tr} implies the correct transit contribution to\ninternal energy. The theoretical entropy of melting is derived, in a single\nformula applying to normal and anomalous melting alike. An ab initio\ncalculation of \\theta_0, based on density functional theory, is reported for\nliquid Na and Cu. Comparison of these calculations with the above analysis of\nexperimental entropy data provides verification of V-T theory. In view of the\npresent results, techniques currently being applied in ab initio simulations of\nliquid properties can be employed to advantage in the further testing and\ndevelopment of V-T theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2009 00:22:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2009 22:33:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 22 May 2009 22:22:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-11"}

We address this discrepancy by reexamining the superburst trigger\nmechanism. We first explore the hypothesis of Kuulkers et al. that exothermic\nelectron captures trigger superbursts. We find that all electron capture\nreactions are thermally stable in accreting neutron star oceans and thus are\nnot a viable trigger mechanism. Fusion reactions other than 12C + 12C are\ninfeasible as well since the possible reactants either deplete at much\nshallower depths or have prohibitively large Coulomb barriers. Thus we confirm\nthe proposal of Cumming & Bildsten and Strohmayer & Brown that 12C + 12C\ntriggers superbursts. We then examine the 12C + 12C fusion rate. The reaction\ncross-section is experimentally unknown at astrophysically relevant energies,\nbut resonances exist in the 12C + 12C system throughout the entire measured\nenergy range. Thus it is likely, and in fact has been predicted, that a\nresonance exists near the Gamow peak energy ~ 1.5 MeV. For such a hypothetical\n1.5 MeV resonance, we derive both a fiducial value and upper limit to the\nresonance strength and find that such a resonance could decrease the\ntheoretically predicted superburst ignition depth by up to a factor of 4; in\nthis case, observationally inferred superburst ignition depths would accord\nwith model predictions for a range of plausible neutron star parameters. Said\ndifferently, such a resonance would decrease the temperature required for\nunstable 12C ignition at a column depth 10^12 g/cm^2 from 6 x 10^8 K to 5 x\n10^8 K. Determining the existence of a strong resonance in the Gamow window\nrequires measurements of the 12C + 12C cross-section down to a center-of-mass\nenergy near 1.5 MeV, which is within reach of the proposed DUSEL facility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2009 01:20:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2009 23:43:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-24"}

In the model, the swelling dynamics\nis governed by the solvent permeation and the elastic interaction; the\npermeation is described by a pressure equation for the solvent, and the elastic\ninteraction is described by displacement equations for the solid network of the\ngel. By introducing an \"elastic pressure\" we first present a reformulation of\nthe original model, and then propose a time-stepping scheme which decouples the\nPDE system at each time step into two sub-problems, one of which is a\ngeneralized Stokes problem for the displacement vector field and another is a\ndiffusion problem for a \"pseudo-pressure\" field. To make such a multiphysical\napproach feasible, it is vital to discover admissible constraints to resolve\nthe uniqueness issue for both sub-problems. The main advantage of the proposed\napproach is that it allows one to utilize any convergent Stokes solver together\nwith any convergent diffusion equation solver to solve the polymer gel model.\nIn the paper, the Taylor-Hood mixed finite element method combined with the\ncontinuous linear finite element method are used as an example to present the\nideas and to demonstrate the viability of the proposed multiphysical approach.\nIt is proved that, under a mesh constraint, both the proposed semi-discrete (in\nspace) and fully discrete methods enjoy some discrete energy laws which mimic\nthe differential energy law satisfied by the PDE solution. Optimal order error\nestimates in various norms are established for the numerical solutions of both\nthe semi-discrete and fully discrete methods.

We observe broad emission features from\nPolycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) in more than 80% of our sample.

Our results thus confirm that\nstarburst activity dominates the bolometric luminosity in SMGs. We find that\nSMGs show weaker silicate absorption at 9.7um than local ULIRGs. We also find\nstronger 6.2um PAH emission in SMGs (relative to the 7.7um PAH feature) than in\nlocal nuclear starbursts, which may be attributed to lower extinction by ice\nalong the line of sight to SMGs. This suggests that the continuum and PAH\nemitting regions of SMGs are less obscured than in local starbursts and\nsimilarly luminous low-redshift ULIRGs. We interpret these results as evidence\nfor a more extended distribution of cool and warm dust in SMGs compared to the\nmore compact emitting regions in local ULIRGs and starbursts. Together these\nresults suggest that SMGs are not simple high-redshift analogs of local ULIRGs\nor nuclear starbursts, but instead they appear to have star formation which\nresembles that seen in less-extreme star-forming environments at z~0 --\nsuggesting their intense activity is distributed across a far larger region\nthan the ~1-kpc nuclear bursts in local ULIRGs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2009 06:36:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

The functionals tested are the modified\nPerdew-Burke-Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation (PBEsol GGA), the\nsecond-order GGA (SOGGA), and the Armiento-Mattsson 2005 (AM05) GGA. For\ncompleteness, we also test more-standard functionals: the local density\napproximation, the original PBE GGA, and the Tao-Perdew-Staroverov-Scuseria\n(TPSS) meta-GGA. We find that the recent density functionals for solids reach a\nhigh accuracy for bulk properties (lattice constant and bulk modulus). For the\ncohesive energy, PBE is better than PBEsol overall, as expected, but PBEsol is\nactually better for the alkali metals and alkali halides. For fair comparison\nof calculated and experimental results, we consider the zero-point phonon and\nfinite-temperature effects ignored by many workers. We show how Gaussian basis\nsets and inaccurate experimental reference data may affect the rating of the\nquality of the functionals.

Noise, gas\nemissions, fuel consumptions are the main environmental aspects which are\ntargeted by aeronautics. From now on, chemical risk linked to the use of\nmaterials and production processes has to be traced, not only because of\nregulation pressure (e.g. REACh) but also because of customers requirements. So\nfar, the aeronautical sector hasn't been focusing much on managing chemical\nrisks at the design stage. However, new substances regulations notably require\nthat chemical risk management should be by industries used as early as possible\nin their product development process. The aeronautics sector has therefore to\nelaborate new chemical risk management. The aim of this paper is to present a\nnew method hat should be adapted to aeronautical designers' practices and based\non simple entry data, but efficient enough to ensure a good substances\ntraceability all along the product design process. The method second objective\nis also to guide the designer's materials and process choices by avoiding the\nmost chemically critical ones. The proposed method has been elaborated by an\nindustrial dedicated team and is based on four main steps. The structure, the\nrelated tools and the parameters of the method have been chosen and developed\nin order to be easily understood by non environmental experts, and directly\noperational. The method is tested on a case study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2009 12:25:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-25"}

Furthermore, we investigate if the inequality\n\\sqrt{M}\\leq \\frac{\\sqrt{R}}{3}+\\sqrt{\\frac{R}{9}+\\frac{Q^2}{3R}}, derived in\n\\cite{An2}, is sharp within the class of solutions to the\nEinstein-Vlasov-Maxwell system. Here M is the ADM mass, Q the charge, and R the\narea radius of the boundary of the static object. We find two classes of\nsolutions with this property, while there is only one in the chargeless case.\nIn particular we find numerical evidence for the existence of arbitrarily thin\nshell solutions to the Einstein-Vlasov-Maxwell system. Finally, we consider one\nparameter families of steady states, and we find spirals in the mass-radius\ndiagram for all examples of the microscopic equation of state which we\nconsider.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2009 14:43:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-24"}

The platform is designed to exploit the synergy of two classes of\nnetwork connections -- dedicated and opportunistic. Previous studies we\nconducted have demonstrated the benefits of such bi-modal resource organization\nthat combines small pools of dedicated computers with a very large pool of\nopportunistic computing capacities of idle computers to serve high throughput\ncomputing applications. This paper extends the idea of bi-modal resource\norganization into the management of communication resources. Since distributed\nstream processing applications demand large volume of data transmission between\nprocessing sites at a consistent rate, adequate control over the network\nresources is important to assure a steady flow of processing. The system model\nused in this paper is a platform where stream processing servers at distributed\nsites are interconnected with a combination of dedicated and opportunistic\ncommunication links. Two pertinent resource allocation problems are analyzed in\ndetails and solved using decentralized algorithms. One is the mapping of the\nstream processing tasks on the processing and the communication resources. The\nother is the adaptive re-allocation of the opportunistic communication links\ndue to the variations in their capacities. Overall optimization goal is higher\ntask throughput and better utilization of the expensive dedicated links. The\nevaluation demonstrates that the algorithms are able to exploit the synergy of\nbi-modal communication links towards achieving the optimization goals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2009 15:37:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-25"}
