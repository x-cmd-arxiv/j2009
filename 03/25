The self-organization of\ncooperative behavior is particularly puzzling for social dilemmas related to\nsharing natural resources or creating common goods.

They defect or cooperate selfishly when the opportunity\narises, and they do not know how often they will interact or have interacted\nwith someone else. Moreover, our individuals have no reputation mechanism to\nform friendship networks, nor do they have the option of voluntary interaction\nor costly punishment. Therefore, the outbreak of prevailing cooperation, when\ndirected motion is integrated in a game-theoretical model, is remarkable,\nparticularly when random strategy mutations and random relocations challenge\nthe formation and survival of cooperative clusters.

Our approach is based upon the notion of macroscopic\ncompact groups of particles and the procedure of averaging of the fields over\nvolumes much greater than the typical scales of these groups. It enables us to\neffectively sum up the contributions from multiple interparticle reemission and\nshort-range correlation effects, represented by all terms in the infinite\niterative series for the electric field strength and induction.

In particular, we consider schemes in which transmitter\nchannel state is inferred from degraded causal error-rate feedback, such as\npacket-level ACK/NAKs in an automatic repeat request (ARQ) system. In such\nschemes, the choice of transmission rate affects not only the subsequent\ngoodput but also the subsequent feedback, implying that the optimal rate\nschedule is given by a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP).\nBecause solution of the POMDP is computationally impractical, we consider\nsimple suboptimal greedy rate assignment and show that the optimal scheme would\nitself be greedy if the error-rate feedback was non-degraded.

We compare the effective radii (R_eff) and\nconcentration of the flux distribution in the rest-frame Near-UV for a sample\nof 270 galaxies in the range 0<z<1. This radial distribution is compared to\nthat measured in the rest-frame B-band, which traces older stellar populations.\nThe analysis is performed using deep, high resolution, multi-band images from\nGALEX, SDSS, and HST/ACS - GOODS-South. The relation R_eff(NUV)- M* suffers a\nmoderate change between z~1 and z~0: at a fixed stellar mass of 1E10 M_sun,\ngalaxies increase their effective radii by a factor 1.18+/-0.06.

The\ndistributions of NUV flux are more compact at z~1 than nowadays, in terms of\nthe fraction of flux enclosed in a specific radius (in kpc).

Substantial improvement in both maps requires astrometry\nwith microsecond of arc measurement precision. Why? First, the 'tops' of both\nstellar maps contain relatively rare objects, for which large populations are\nnot found until the observing horizon reaches hundreds or thousands of parsecs.\nSecond, the 'bottoms' and 'sides' of both maps contain stars, either\nintrinsically faint, or whose rarity guarantees great distance, hence apparent\nfaintness. With an extensive collection of high accuracy masses that can only\nbe provided by astrometry with microsecond of arc measurement precision,\nastronomers will be able to stress test theoretical models of stars at any mass\nand at every stage in their aging processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2009 18:30:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2009 14:46:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-25"}

These two\nfeatures of the multiplicative noise model preclude the direct application of\nstate-of-the-art restoration methods, such as those based on the combination of\ntotal variation or wavelet-based regularization with a quadratic observation\nterm. In this paper, we tackle these difficulties by: (1) using the common\ntrick of converting the multiplicative model into an additive one by taking\nlogarithms, and (2) adopting the recently proposed split Bregman approach to\nestimate the underlying image under total variation regularization. This\napproach is based on formulating a constrained problem equivalent to the\noriginal unconstrained one, which is then solved using Bregman iterations\n(equivalently, an augmented Lagrangian method).

AIMS: We aim to compare the results for giants with new,\naccurate abundances for all observable elements in 18 EMP turnoff stars.\nMETHODS:VLT/UVES spectra at R ~45,000 and S/N~ 130 per pixel (330-1000 nm) are\nanalysed with OSMARCS model atmospheres and the TURBOSPECTRUM code to derive\nabundances for C, Mg, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Zn, Sr, and Ba. RESULTS:\nFor Ca, Ni, Sr, and Ba, we find excellent consistency with our earlier sample\nof EMP giants, at all metallicities. However, our abundances of C, Sc, Ti, Cr,\nMn and Co are ~0.2 dex larger than in giants of similar metallicity. Mg and Si\nabundances are ~0.2 dex lower (the giant [Mg/Fe] values are slightly revised),\nwhile Zn is again ~0.4 dex higher than in giants of similar [Fe/H] (6 stars\nonly). CONCLUSIONS:For C, the dwarf/giant discrepancy could possibly have an\nastrophysical cause, but for the other elements it must arise from shortcomings\nin the analysis. Approximate computations of granulation (3D) effects yield\nsmaller corrections for giants than for dwarfs, but suggest that this is an\nunlikely explanation, except perhaps for C, Cr, and Mn. NLTE computations for\nNa and Al provide consistent abundances between dwarfs and giants, unlike the\nLTE results, and would be highly desirable for the other discrepant elements as\nwell. Meanwhile, we recommend using the giant abundances as reference data for\nGalactic chemical evolution models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2009 20:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Unfortunately, the original methods suffer from the truncation-error\nbeing first-order accurate at all extrema despite the accuracy of the\nhigher-order method. To remedy this problem, higher-order extensions were\nproposed that relied on elaborate analytic and geometric constructions. Since\nextremum-preserving limiters are applied only at extrema, additional\ncomputational cost is negligible. Therefore, extremum-preserving limiters\nensure higher-order spatial accuracy while maintaining simplicity. This report\npresents higher-order limiting for (i) computing van Leer slopes and (ii)\nadjusting parabolic profiles. This limiting preserves monotonicity and accuracy\nat smooth extrema, maintains stability in the presence of discontinuities and\nunder-resolved gradients, and is based on constraining the interpolated values\nat extrema (and only at extrema) by using nonlinear combinations of second\nderivatives. The van Leer limiting can be done separately and implemented in\nMUSCL (Monotone Upstream-centered Schemes for Conservation Laws) or done in\nconcert with the parabolic profile limiting and implemented in PPM (Piecewise\nParabolic Method). The extremum-preserving limiters elegantly fit into any\nalgorithm which uses conventional limiting techniques. Limiters are outlined\nfor scalar advection and nonlinear systems of conservation laws.

A stellar\nspheroid with a de Vaucouleurs-like profile is detected from a radial distance\nof 0.5 kpc to the edge of the survey at 25 kpc; the structure appears to become\nmore flattened with distance, reaching q = 0.50 in the outermost halo region\nprobed.

The circumstellar optical depth could be then estimated\ncomparing the integrated polarization position angle (PA) with the direction of\nthe major axis of the disk projected in the plane of the sky. In general,\noptically thin disks have polarization PA perpendicular to the disk plane. In\ncontrast, optically thick disks produce polarization PA parallel to the disks.\nAmong the T Tauri stars, three are consistent with optically thin disks (AS\n353A, RY Tau and UY Aur) and five with optically thick disks (V536 Aql, DG Tau,\nDO Tau, HL Tau and LkHalpha 358).

However, existing gene network models\ndo not explain more complex properties of cell fate dynamics such as the\nhierarchical branching of developmental paths. Here, we construct a generic\nminimal model of the genetic regulatory network controlling cell fate\ndetermination, which exhibits five elementary characteristics of cell\ndifferentiation: stability, directionality, branching, exclusivity, and\npromiscuous expression. We argue that a modular architecture comprising\nrepeated network elements reproduces these features of differentiation by\nsequentially repressing selected modules and hence restricting the dynamics to\nlower dimensional subspaces of the high-dimensional state space. We implement\nour model both with ordinary differential equations (ODEs), to explore the role\nof bifurcations in producing the one-way character of differentiation, and with\nstochastic differential equations (SDEs), to demonstrate the effect of noise on\nthe system. We further argue that binary cell fate decisions are prevalent in\ncell differentiation due to general features of the underlying dynamical\nsystem.

While it\nis well known that the MFL of asymptotic flat black hole is equivalent to its\nthermodynamical first law, however we do not know the detail of MFL of black\nhole spacetimes with cosmological constant which possess black hole and\ncosmological event horizons. Then this paper aims to formulate an MFL of the\ntwo-horizon spacetimes. For this purpose, we try to include the effects of two\nhorizons in the MFL. To do so, we make use of the Iyer-Wald formalism and\nextend it to regard the mass parameter and the cosmological constant as two\nindependent variables which make it possible to treat the two horizons on the\nsame footing. Our extended Iyer-Wald formalism preserves the existence of\nconserved Noether current and its associated Noether charge, and gives the\nabstract form of MFL of black hole spacetimes with cosmological constant. Then,\nas a representative application of that formalism, we derive the MFL of\nSchwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) spacetime. Our MFL of SdS spacetime relates the\nvariations of three quantities; the mass parameter, the total area of two\nhorizons and the volume enclosed by two horizons. If our MFL is regarded as a\nthermodynamical first law of SdS spacetime, it offers a thermodynamically\nconsistent description of SdS black hole evaporation process: The mass\ndecreases while the volume and the entropy increase. In our suggestion, the\ngeneralized second law is not needed to ensure the second law of SdS\nthermodynamics for its evaporation process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2009 03:33:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-20"}

In this way the liquid enters in the supercooled phase.\nSupercooled liquids have a very rich phenomenology, which is still far from\nbeing completely understood. To begin with, there is the problem of how to\nprevent crystallization and how deeply the liquid can be supercooled before a\nmetastability limit is hit. But by far the most interesting feature of\nsupercooled liquids is the dynamic glass transition: when the temperature is\ndecreased below a certain point, the relaxation time increases so much that a\ndramatic dynamical arrest intervenes and we are unable to equilibrate the\nsystem within reasonable experimental times. The glass transition is a\nphenomenon whose physical origin has stirred an enormous interest in the last\nhundred years. Why does it occur?

What is the\ncorrelation length associated to the sharp increase of the relaxation time? Can\nwe define a new kind of amorphous order?

In addition, the privacy-preserving property of\nstate-of-the-art IP address anonymization techniques has come into question by\nrecent attacks that successfully identified a large number of hosts in\nanonymized traces.\n  In this paper, we examine the tradeoff between data utility for anomaly\ndetection and the risk of host identification for IP address truncation.\nSpecifically, we analyze three weeks of unsampled and non-anonymized network\ntraces from a medium-sized backbone network to assess data utility. The risk of\nde-anonymizing individual IP addresses is formally evaluated, using a metric\nbased on conditional entropy.\n  Our results indicate that truncation effectively prevents host identification\nbut degrades the utility of data for anomaly detection. However, the degree of\ndegradation depends on the metric used and whether network-internal or external\naddresses are considered. Entropy metrics are more resistant to truncation than\nunique counts and the detection quality of anomalies degrades much faster in\ninternal addresses than in external addresses. In particular, the usefulness of\ninternal address counts is lost even for truncation of only 4 bits whereas\nutility of external address entropy is virtually unchanged even for truncation\nof 20 bits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2009 09:06:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-26"}

We start from exact\nexpressions for shear-dependent steady-state averages, such as correlation and\nstructure functions, in the form of generalized Green-Kubo relations. To these\nwe apply approximations inspired by the mode coupling theory (MCT) for the\nquiescent system, accessing steady-state properties by integration through the\ntransient dynamics after startup of steady shear. Exact equations of motion,\nwith memory effects, for the required transient density correlation functions\nare derived next; these can also be approximated within an MCT-like approach.\nThis results in closed equations for the non-equilibrium stationary state of\nsheared dense colloidal dispersions, with the equilibrium structure factor of\nthe unsheared system as the only input. In three dimensions, these equations\ncurrently require further approximation prior to numerical solution. However,\nsome universal aspects can be analyzed exactly, including the discontinuous\nonset of a yield stress at the ideal glass transition predicted by MCT. Using\nthese methods we additionally discuss the distorted microstructure of a sheared\nhard-sphere colloid near the glass transition, and consider how this relates to\nthe shear stress. Time-dependent fluctuations around the stationary state are\nthen approximated, and compared to data from experiment and simulation; the\ncorrelators for yielding glassy states obey a `time-shear-superposition'\nprinciple. The work presented here fully develops an approach first outlined\npreviously (M. Fuchs and M. E. Cates, Phys. Rev.

The counterterms needed are then the ones of\na free massive scalar in asymptotically AdS_{q+1}.

In most of the cases, the\noverlay neighbors are chosen randomly for robustness of the overlay. However,\nthis causes nodes that are distant in terms of proximity in the underlying\nphysical network to become neighbors, and thus data travels unnecessary\ndistances before reaching the destination. For efficiency of bulk data\ntransmission like multimedia streaming, the overlay neighborhood should\nresemble the proximity in the underlying network. In this paper, we exploit the\nproximity and redundancy properties of a recently proposed clique-based\nclustered overlay network, named eQuus, to build efficient as well as robust\noverlays for multimedia stream dissemination. To combine the efficiency of\ncontent pushing over tree structured overlays and the robustness of data-driven\nmesh overlays, higher capacity stable nodes are organized in tree structure to\ncarry the long haul traffic and less stable nodes with intermittent presence\nare organized in localized meshes. The overlay construction and fault-recovery\nprocedures are explained in details. Simulation study demonstrates the good\nlocality properties of the platform.

We analyze the uniqueness of the solutions for the mass\nspectrum in terms of the measured endpoints in the observable invariant mass\ndistributions. We provide simple analytical inversion formulas for the masses\nin terms of the measured endpoints. We show that in a sizable portion of the\nSUSY mass parameter space the solutions always suffer from a two-fold\nambiguity, due to the fact that the original relations between the masses and\nthe endpoints are piecewise-defined functions. The ambiguity persists even in\nthe ideal case of a perfect detector and infinite statistics.
