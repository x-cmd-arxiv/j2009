In\nthe streaming model the joint distribution is given by a stream of $k$-tuples,\nwith the goal of testing correlations among the components measured over the\nentire stream. In the streaming model, Indyk and McGregor (SODA 08) recently\ngave exciting new results for measuring pairwise independence. The Indyk and\nMcGregor methods provide $\\log{n}$-approximation under statistical distance\nbetween the joint and product distributions in the streaming model. Indyk and\nMcGregor leave, as their main open question, the problem of improving their\n$\\log n$-approximation for the statistical distance metric.\n  In this paper we solve the main open problem posed by of Indyk and McGregor\nfor the statistical distance for pairwise independence and extend this result\nto any constant $k$. In particular, we present an algorithm that computes an\n$(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-approximation of the statistical distance between the\njoint and product distributions defined by a stream of $k$-tuples. Our\nalgorithm requires $O(({1\\over \\epsilon}\\log({nm\\over \\delta}))^{(30+k)^k})$\nmemory and a single pass over the data stream.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Mar 2009 01:29:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-03"}

Then, we add the morphological information and find\nthat 80-90% of the massive quiescent galaxies (log(M)~11) have an elliptical\nmorphology at z<0.8. Therefore, a dominant mechanism links the shutdown of star\nformation and the acquisition of an elliptical morphology in massive galaxies.\nStill, a significant fraction of quiescent galaxies present a Spi/Irr\nmorphology at low mass (40-60% at log(M)~9.5), but this fraction is smaller\nthan predicted by semi-analytical models using a ``halo quenching'' recipe. We\nalso analyze the evolution of star-forming galaxies and split them into\n``intermediate activity'' and ``high activity'' galaxies.

Finally, the space density of massive star-forming galaxies becomes\nlower than the space density of massive elliptical galaxies at z<1. As a\nconsequence, the rate of ``wet mergers'' involved in the formation of the most\nmassive ellipticals must decline very rapidly at z<1, which could explain the\nobserved slow down in the assembly of these quiescent and massive sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Feb 2009 19:58:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2009 12:49:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-15"}
