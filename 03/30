John Nash proved more than 50 years ago that an equilibrium always\nexists such that nobody would benefit from unilaterally changing his strategy.\nNash Equilibrium is a central concept in game theory, which offers a\nmathematical foundation for social science and economy. However, it is\nimportant from both a theoretical and a practical point of view to understand\ngame playing where individuals are less selfish. This paper offers a\nconstructive generalization of Nash equilibrium to study n-person games where\nthe selfishness of individuals can be defined at any level, including the\nextreme of complete selfishness. The generalization is constructive since it\noffers a protocol for individuals in a society to reach an equilibrium. Most\nimportantly, this paper presents experimental results and theoretical\ninvestigation to show that the individuals in a society can reduce their\nselfishness level together to reach a new equilibrium where they can have\nbetter payoffs and the society is more stable at the same time. This study\nsuggests that, for the benefit of everyone in a society (including the\nfinancial market), the pursuit of maximal payoff by each individual should be\ncontrolled at some level either by voluntary good citizenship or by imposed\nregulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2009 06:38:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-31"}

These materials are isostructural with (Fe2P2)(Sr4Sc2O6), which was\nfound in our previous study. The new compounds are tetragonal with a space\ngroup of P4/nmm and consist of the anti-fluorite type FeAs layer and\nperovskite-type blocking layer. The lattice constants are a = 4.050 A, c =\n15.809 A for M = Sc and a = 3.918 A, c = 15.683 A for M = Cr. These compounds\nhave long interlayer Fe-Fe distances corresponding to the c-axis length, the\n15.8 A in Sc-22426 is the longest in the iron-based oxypnictide systems.\nChemical flexibility of the perovskite block in this system was probed by\nchromium containing (Fe2As2)(Sr4Cr2O6). Different trends were found in bond\nangle and bond length of the new oxypnictides compared to the reported systems,\nsuch as REFePnO. Absence of superconductivity in these compounds is considered\nto be due to insufficient carrier concentration as in the case of undoped\nREFeAsO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2009 05:59:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2009 22:43:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 24 Jun 2009 06:31:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-24"}

This paradox still appears to be regarded\nby some physicists as a proof that (i) only physical bodies, but not space,\nundergo relativistic length contraction and (ii) a relativistically contracted\nbody experiences a stress. This note, dedicated to the one hundredth\nanniversary of Hermann Minkowski's paper \"Space and Time\", shows that a proper\nrelativistic treatment of the paradox demonstrates that it is a manifestation\nof a specific relativistic acceleration phenomenon, which does not have a\nclassical analog. This means that length contraction plays no role in the\nresolution of the paradox. It is also shown that no stress is involved in the\nlength contraction effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2009 05:04:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-31"}

These were used together with our previous H2D+ observations.\nMoreover, archival FIR Spitzer/MIPS maps were combined with the LABOCA map to\ndistinguish between pre- and protostellar cores, and to estimate the\nevolutionary stages of protostars. Twelve dense cores were detected at 870\nmicron in the Ori B9 cloud. The submm cores constitute ~4% of the total mass of\nthe Ori B9 region. There is an equal number of pre- and protostellar cores. Two\nof the submm sources, which we call SMM 3 and SMM 4, are previously unknown\nClass 0 candidates. We found a moderate degree of deuteration in N2H+\n(0.03-0.04). There is, furthermore, evidence for N2H+ depletion in the core SMM\n4. We derive a relatively high degree of ionization (~10^-7) in the clump\nassociated with IRAS 05405-0117. The ambipolar diffusion timescales for two of\nthe cores are ~70-100 times longer than the free-fall time. The distribution\nand masses of dense cores in Ori B9 are similar to those observed in more\nactive regions in Orion, where the statistical core properties have been\nexplained by turbulent fragmentation. The 50/50 proportions of pre- and\nprotostellar cores suggest that duration of the prestellar phase is comparable\nto the free-fall time.

For the\npurposes of this study, a piece-wise linear nondifferentiable quantizer\ncharacteristic is considered.

In the ICP the entropy run k(r) is mainly shaped by shocks, as\nsteadily set by supersonic accretion of gas at the cluster boundary, and\nintermittently driven from the center by merging events or by AGNs; the\nresulting equilibrium is described by the exact yet simple formalism\nconstituting our ICP Supermodel. With a few parameters, this accurately\nrepresents the runs of density n(r) and temperature T(r) as required by recent\nX-ray data on surface brightness and spectroscopy for both cool core (CC) and\nnon cool core (NCC) clusters; the former are marked by a middle temperature\npeak, whose location is predicted from rich clusters to groups.

Among others,\nFan and Lv [J. R. Stat. Soc. Ser. B Stat. Methodol. 70 (2008) 849-911] propose\nan independent screening framework by ranking the marginal correlations. They\nshowed that the correlation ranking procedure possesses a sure independence\nscreening property within the context of the linear model with Gaussian\ncovariates and responses. In this paper, we propose a more general version of\nthe independent learning with ranking the maximum marginal likelihood estimates\nor the maximum marginal likelihood itself in generalized linear models. We show\nthat the proposed methods, with Fan and Lv [J. R. Stat. Soc. Ser. B Stat.\nMethodol. 70 (2008) 849-911] as a very special case, also possess the sure\nscreening property with vanishing false selection rate. The conditions under\nwhich the independence learning possesses a sure screening is surprisingly\nsimple. This justifies the applicability of such a simple method in a wide\nspectrum. We quantify explicitly the extent to which the dimensionality can be\nreduced by independence screening, which depends on the interactions of the\ncovariance matrix of covariates and true parameters. Simulation studies are\nused to illustrate the utility of the proposed approaches. In addition, we\nestablish an exponential inequality for the quasi-maximum likelihood estimator\nwhich is useful for high-dimensional statistical learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2009 15:58:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 Apr 2009 22:26:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2009 04:12:40 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2010 17:53:14 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2012 09:49:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-14"}
