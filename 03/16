The sample covers a six-magnitude range in luminosity,\nfrom giant ellipticals to dwarfs at M^*+4. We exploit the wide mass range to\ninvestigate systematic trends in the abundance ratios Mg/Fe, Ca/Fe, C/Fe and\nN/Fe. We find that each of these ratios can be well modelled using\ntwo-parameter relations of the form [X/Fe] = a0 + a1 log sigma + a2 [Fe/H],\nwhere sigma is the velocity dispersion. Analysing these \"X-planes\" reveals new\nstructure in the abundance patterns, beyond the traditional one-parameter (e.g.\nMg/Fe-sigma) correlations. The X-planes for the alpha elements, Mg and Ca,\nindicate a positive correlation with velocity dispersion, and simultaneously an\nanti-correlation with Fe/H (i.e. a1>0 and a2<0). Taking both effects into\naccount dramatically reduces the scatter, compared to the traditional\nX/Fe-sigma relations. For C and N, a similar correlation with velocity\ndispersion is recovered, but there is no additional dependence on Fe/H (i.e.\na1>0 and a2~0). The explicit dependence of X/Fe on two parameters is evidence\nthat at least two physical processes are at work in setting the abundance\npatterns. The Fe/H dependence of Mg/Fe and Ca/Fe, at fixed sigma, may result\nfrom different durations of star formation, from galaxy to galaxy. The absence\nof corresponding Fe/H dependence for C and N is consistent with these elements\nbeing generated in lower-mass stars. The increase with sigma, at fixed Fe/H, is\nsimilar for elements Mg, C and N, and slightly shallower for Ca. This pattern\nof trends cannot be explained solely by a systematic variation of\nstar-formation time-scale with sigma.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2009 14:55:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Mar 2009 09:47:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 28 May 2009 12:02:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Traditional N-body simulations of multiple-planet systems without\ngas disks have successfully reproduced the eccentricity (e) distribution of the\nobserved systems, by assuming that the planetary systems are relatively closely\npacked when the gas disk dissipates, so that they become dynamically unstable\nwithin the stellar lifetime. However, such studies cannot explain the small\nsemi-major axes (a) of extrasolar planetary systems, if planets are formed, as\nthe standard planet formation theory suggests, beyond the ice line.\n  In this paper, we numerically study the evolution of three-planet systems in\ndissipating gas disks, and constrain the initial conditions that reproduce the\nobserved semi-major axis and eccentricity distributions simultaneously. We\nadopt the initial conditions that are motivated by the standard planet\nformation theory, and self-consistently simulate the disk evolution, and planet\nmigration by using a hybrid N-body and 1D gas disk code. We also take account\nof eccentricity damping, and investigate the effect of saturation of corotation\nresonances on the evolution of planetary systems. We find that the semi-major\naxis distribution is largely determined in a gas disk, while the eccentricity\ndistribution is determined after the disk dissipation. We also find that there\nmay be an optimum disk mass which leads to the observed a-e distribution. Our\nsimulations generate a larger fraction of planetary systems trapped in\nmean-motion resonances (MMRs) than the observations, indicating that the disk's\nperturbation to the planetary orbits may be important to explain the observed\nrate of MMRs.

We find that the X-ray filament consists of five spatially\nresolved X-ray knots embedded in a continuous diffuse bridge. The spectrum of\neach knot is well fitted by a thermal model with temperatures ranging from\n0.3-0.7 keV and subsolar elemental abundances. In four of the five knots,\nnon-thermal models are a poor fit to the spectra, conclusively ruling out\nsynchrotron or IC/CMB mechanisms for their emission. The internal pressures of\nthe knots exceed that of the ambient ISM or the equipartition pressure of the\nNML by more than an order of magnitude, demonstrating that they must be short\nlived ($\\sim3\\times10^6$ yrs). Based on energetic arguments, it is implausible\nthat these knots have been ionized by the beamed flux from the active galactic\nnucleus of Cen A or that they have been shock-heated by supersonic inflation of\nthe NML. In our view, the most viable scenario for the origin of the X-ray\nknots is that they are the result of cold gas shock heated by a direct\ninteraction with the jet. The lifetimes of the X-ray knots in the NML are\nroughly the same as the age of the strong shock around the SW inner lobe,\nsuggesting they were created in the same AGN outburst. The most plausible model\nof the NML is that it is a bubble from a previous outburst that is being\nre-energized by the current outburst.

The disk\npopulation around late-type stars is dominated by disks with inner holes\n(canonical 'transition disks') and 'homologously depleted' disks.

In this research, the\nlaminar flow is described as a macro deformation which forms an instant\ncurvature space. On such a curvature space, the turbulence is viewed as a micro\ndeformation. So, the fluid flow is described by the geometrical field theory of\nfinite deformation. Based on the Lagrange mechanics and the deformation energy\nconcept, using the Least Action Principle, the Euler-Lagrange motion equations\nare obtained. According to A E Green formulation, the stress concept is\nintroduced by deformation tensor. The fluid motion is described by the\nmultiplication of a macro deformation tensor and a micro deformation tensor. By\nthis way, the geometrical field of fluid motion is well constructed. Then, the\nspatial derivative of deformation energy is expressed by the gradient of\ndeformation tensors. By this way, the deformation energy related items in the\nEuler-Lagrange motion equations are expressed by the stress tensor and\ndeformation tensor. The obtained Euler-Lagrange motion equations, then, are\ndecomposed into average deformation equations and turbulence equations. For\nseveral special cases, the new results are compared with the conventional\nNavier-Stokes equation with Reynolds stress modification.The comparisons also\nshow that the Bernoulli Equation is a natural precondition for the conventional\nNavier-Stokes equation.Generally, the turbulence wave is an inward-traveling\nwave.

The quality of service provided to each class is given by\nthe expected delay between the arrival of a demand in the class, and that\ndemand's service completion. The goal is to design a routing policy for the\nservice vehicles which minimizes a convex combination of the delays for each\nclass. First, we provide a lower bound on the achievable values of the convex\ncombination of delays. Then, we propose a novel routing policy and analyze its\nperformance under heavy load conditions (i.e., when the fraction of time the\nservice vehicles spend performing on-site service approaches one).

For instance, the magnetic helicity of an active region is\noften about $10^{42}$ Mx$^2$ ($10^{26}$ Wb$^{2}$), but the observed processes\nwhereby it is thought to be injected into the corona do not yet provide an\naccurate estimate of the resulting magnetic helicity budget or time evolution.\nThe variation in magnetic helicity is important for understanding the physics\nof flares, coronal mass ejections, and their associated magnetic clouds. To\nshed light on this topic, we investigate here the changes in magnetic helicity\ndue to electric currents in the corona for a single twisted flux tube that may\nmodel characteristic coronal structures such as active region filaments,\nsigmoids, or coronal loops. For a bipolar photospheric magnetic field and\nseveral distributions of current, we extrapolated the coronal field as a\nnonlinear force-free field.

Starting from a magnetic configuration\nwith a moderate amount of current, the amount of magnetic helicity can increase\nby 2 orders of magnitude when the maximum current strength is increased by a\nfactor of 2. The high sensitivity of magnetic helicity to the current density\ncan partially explain discrepancies between measured values on the photosphere,\nin the corona, and in magnetic clouds.

For t close to present\ntime it works as an additional contribution to the effective cosmological\nconstant and, later, it produces the transition to a phantom era, which could\nactually be taking place right now in some regions of the cosmos, and might\nhave observable consequences. For t close to the Rip time, the universe becomes\ncompletely dominated by the dark fluid, whose equation of state is phantom-like\nat that time. Our model, which is able to reproduce the dark energy period\nquite precisely, may still be modified in such a way that the epoch dominated\nby an effective cosmological constant, produced by the F (R) term and by the\ndark fluid contribution, becomes significantly shorter, what happens when a\nmatter term is included.

Two examples of application of the proposed\ncorrection method are presented on the results of an undrained isotropic\ncompression test and an undrained heating test performed on a fluid-saturated\ngranular rock.

However, observations of events exist in which a pronounced\nincrease in soft X-ray emission is observed minutes before the onset of the\nhard X-ray emission. Such pre-flare emission clearly contradicts the classical\nflare picture. For the first time, the pre-flare phase of such solar flares is\nstudied in detail. We want to explain the time evolution of the observed\nemission by means of alternative energy transport mechanisms such as heat\nconduction. RHESSI events displaying pronounced pre-flare emission were\nanalyzed in imaging and spectroscopy. The pre-flare phase is characterized by\npurely thermal emission from a coronal source with increasing emission measure\nand density. After this earliest phase, a small non-thermal tail to higher\nenergies appears in the spectra, becoming more and more pronounced. However,\nimages still only display one X-ray source, implying that this non-thermal\nemission is coronal.

Non-parametric fits often suffer from other\nproblems, however. We discuss these before suggesting a non-parametric method,\nWp smoothing, which seems to avoid some of them. After outlining the principles\nof Wp smoothing we describe an algorithm used to implement it. We then apply Wp\nsmoothing to a synthetic data cube for the LOFAR EoR experiment. The\nperformance of Wp smoothing, measured by the extent to which it is able to\nrecover the variance of the cosmological signal and to which it avoids leakage\nof power from the foregrounds, is compared to that of a parametric fit, and to\nanother non-parametric method (smoothing splines).

At the first order approximation the theory was developed by modeling the\ntwo-components with two cored power-law density profiles.

We describe practical optimizations that allow us to handle\nlarger discriminants than other methods, with |D| as large as 10^13 and h(D) up\nto 10^6.

The model\nconsists of an array of blocks coupled by springs, with the forces between\nneighbouring blocks balanced by static friction. We calculate the probability,\nP(s), of the occurrence of avalanches with a size s or greater, finding that\nour results are consistent with the phenomenology and also with previous models\nwhich exhibit a power law over a wide range. We show that the train model may\nbe mapped onto a stochastic sandpile model and study a variant of the latter\nfor non-spherical grains. We show that, in this case, the model has critical\nbehaviour only for grains with large aspect ratio, as was already shown in\nexperiments with real ricepiles. We also demonstrate a way to introduce\nrandomness in a physically motivated manner into the model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2009 15:57:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Long ago, Starobinsky proposed that infra-red effects in\nde Sitter space could be accommodated by evolving the long-wavelength part of\nthe field according to the classical field equations plus a stochastic source\nterm. I argue that--when quantum-mechanical loop corrections are taken into\naccount--the separate-universe picture of superhorizon evolution in de Sitter\nspace is equivalent, in a certain leading-logarithm approximation, to\nStarobinsky's stochastic approach. In particular, the time evolution of a box\nof de Sitter space can be understood in exact analogy with the DGLAP evolution\nof partons within a hadron, which describes a slow logarithmic evolution in the\ndistribution of the hadron's constituent partons with the energy scale at which\nthey are probed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2009 15:59:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2009 14:29:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-19"}
