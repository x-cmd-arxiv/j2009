For strong\ncoupling, we found a quasi-diffusive growth of the width of the momentum\ndistribution, in which the apparent diffusion coefficient decreased as time\nincreased. The behavior in this regime can be described by the scaling theory\nof weak localization for two-dimensional disordered lattices. The weak and\nstrong coupling regimes are separated by a regime of complex intermediate\nbehavior. Thus we explain the apparent contradiction in the literature as being\ndue to qualitatively different regimes of behavior, which we call strong and\nweak quantum localization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2009 18:58:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2009 07:15:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-15"}

We consider the effect of periodic boundary\nconditions [PBC(+)] on fermions as well as antiperiodic boundary conditions\n[ABC(-)]. The use of PBC(+) produces a rich phase structure.

The base pair stretchings are described by an\nensemble of paths selected through a macroscopic constraint, the fulfillement\nof the second law of thermodynamics. The number of paths contributing to the\npartition function strongly increases around and above a specific temperature\n$T^*_c$ whereas the fraction of unbound base pairs grows continuosly around and\nabove $T^*_c$. The latter is identified with the denaturation temperature.\nThus, the separation of the two complementary strands appears as a highly\ncooperative phenomenon displaying a smooth crossover versus $T$. The\nthermodynamical properties have been computed in a large temperature range by\nvarying the size of the path ensemble at the lower bound of the range. No\nsignificant physical dependence on the system size has been envisaged. The\nentropy grows continuosly versus $T$ while the specific heat displays a\nremarkable peak at $T^*_c$. The location of the peak versus $T$ varies with the\nstiffness of the anharmonic stacking interaction along the strand.

We\nfind that the covariant (Gupta-Bleuler) method exhibits certain difficulties\nwhen trying to impose the quantum Lorenz condition on cosmological scales. We\nthus explore the possibility of consistently quantizing without imposing such a\ncondition. In this case there are three physical states, which are the two\ntransverse polarizations of the massless photon and a new massless scalar mode\ncoming from the temporal and longitudinal components of the electromagnetic\nfield.

It was recently shown that low-mass star\ndepletion can qualitatively explain the M/L discrepancy. To verify whether it\nis indeed the driving mechanism, we derive dissolution timescales and use these\nto predict the M/L_V ratios of the 24 Galactic GCs for which orbital parameters\nand dynamical M/L_V are known. We also predict the slopes of their low-mass\nstellar mass functions (MFs).

The predicted M/L_V are in 1 sigma\nagreement with the observations for 12 out of 24 GCs. The discrepancy for the\nother GCs probably arises because our predictions give global M/L ratios, while\nthe observations represent extrapolated central values that are different from\nglobal ones in case of mass segregation and a long dissolution timescale. GCs\nin our sample which likely have dissimilar global and central M/L ratios can be\nexcluded by imposing limits on the dissolution timescale and King parameter.\nFor the remaining GCs, the observed and predicted average M/L_V are 78^+9_-11%\nand 78+/-2% of the canonically expected values, while for the entire sample the\nvalues are 74^+6_-7% and 85+/-1%. The predicted correlation between the slope\nof the low-mass stellar MF and M/L_V is qualitatively consistent with observed\nMF slopes.

Since only about 2 % of the\nsilicon nuclei are located within one Bohr radius of the donor electron,\nnuclear spin diffusion is important in transferring the polarization to all the\nspins.

A novelty of the approach is that the analysis of the azimuthal angle\ndependence in a frame other than the usual helicity frame offers an independent\ncross-check on the extraction of the spin. Moreover, in some instances when the\ntransverse polarisation tensor of highest rank is vanishing, for an accidental\nor dynamical reason, the standard azimuthal asymmetries vanish and would lead\nto a measurement with a wrong spin assignment. In a frame such as the one we\nconstruct, the correct spin assignment would however still be possible. The\nmethod gives direct information about the spin of the particle under\nconsideration and the same event sample can be used to identify the spins of\neach particle in a decay chain. A drawback of the method is that it is\ninstrumental only when the momenta of the test particle can be reconstructed.\nHowever we hope that it might still be of use in situations with only partial\nreconstruction.

The source was observed simultaneously at various\nwavelengths up to soft gamma-rays with the INTEGRAL satellite, from 2005\nFebruary to September. X-ray novae are extreme systems that often harbor a\nblack hole, and are known to emit throughout the electromagnetic spectrum when\nin outburst. We analyzed radio, (N)IR, optical, X-ray and soft gamma-ray\nobservations and constructed simultaneous broad-band X-ray spectra. Analyzing\nboth the light curves in various energy ranges and the hardness-intensity\ndiagram enabled us to study the long-term behavior of the source. Spectral\nparameters were typical of the Soft Intermediate States and the High Soft\nStates of a black hole candidate. The source showed relatively small spectral\nvariations in X-rays with considerable flux variation in radio. Spectral\nstudies showed that the accretion disc cooled down from 0.64 to 0.27 keV in 100\ndays and that the total flux decreased while the relative flux of the hot\nmedium increased. Radio emission was detected several times, and,\ninterestingly, five days after entering the HSS. Modeling the spectral energy\ndistribution from the radio to the soft gamma-rays reveals that the radio\nflares arise from several ejection events. XTE J1818-245 is likely a black hole\ncandidate transient source that might be closer than the Galactic Bulge. The\nresults from the data analysis trace the physical changes that took place in\nthe system at a maximum bolometric luminosity of (0.4-0.9)e38 erg/s (assuming a\ndistance between 2.8-4.3 kpc) and they are discussed within the context of disc\nand jet models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2009 22:57:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Most likely these cosmic rays have originated from compact objects. Their\nexact sources are yet to be identified. It has been suggested before that gamma\nray bursts are possible sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. The two\nmodels of gamma ray burst emissions most often discussed are the internal and\nexternal shock models. We have calculated the proton spectrum above 60EeV from\nall gamma ray bursts distributed upto a redshift of 0.02 in the internal shock\nmodel assuming redshift and luminosity distributions consistent with\nobservations, log normal distributions for their values of Lorentz factors,\nvariability times and duration of bursts. Within the external shock model we\nhave calculated the proton flux above 60EeV from all nearby gamma ray bursts\nassuming log normal distributions in their values of total energies, Lorentz\nfactors at the deceleration epoch and compared with the observed data. We find\nthat gamma ray bursts can produce cosmic ray proton flux comparable to the flux\nobserved by the Pierre Auger experiment both within the internal and external\nshock models. We have also studied the dependence of the maximum proton\nenergies and the cooling breaks in the proton spectrum on the various\nparameters like Lorentz factor, energy of the GRB fireball, variability time\n(in case of internal shocks), ambient particle density (in case of external\nshocks).

The method is applied to\ndifferent sets of mock data to explore a range of observational limits: (i) the\nnumber of lens galaxies in the survey, (ii) the mass threshold, Mlow, for the\ndetection of substructures and (iii) the uncertainty of the measured\nsubstructure masses. We explore two different priors on the mass function\nslope: a uniform prior and a Gaussian prior with alpha = 1.90+-0.1. With a\nsubstructure detection threshold Mlow=3x10^8 Msun, the number of lenses\navailable now (n_l=30), a true dark-matter mass fraction in (CDM) substructure\n<=1.0% and a prior of alpha = 1.90+-0.1, we find that the upper limit of f can\nbe constrained down to a level <=1.0% (95% CL). In the case of a Gaussian prior\non alpha, it is always possible to set stringent constraints on both\nparameters.

A\nthorough analysis towards the correlation between both structural and Raman\nmodes parameters has been undertaken. Our results provide evidence for two main\nstructural distortions of MnO6 octahedra, arising from a cooperative\nJahn-Teller and rotational distortions in these compounds. The temperature\ndependence of the B1g symmetric stretching mode of the MnO6 units has revealed\neither a positive or negative shift regarding the pure anharmonic temperature\ndependence of the phonon frequency, which strongly depends on the\nY-concentration. This frequency renormalization is explained in terms of a\ncompetition between ferro and antiferromagnetic interactions. The pronounced\nfrequency renormalization of the symmetric stretching mode for x=0.2 evidences\nthe predominance of the ferromagnetic interactions against the\nantiferromagnetic ones, which is in good correlation with the spontaneous\nmagnetization measured in this compound. The emerging of the shifts referred\nwell above the Neel temperature is likely associated with the coupling between\nphonons and dynamical fluctuations of the magnetic system, which provides\nfurther grounds for the existence of strong spin-phonon coupling in this\ncompound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Mar 2009 09:43:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-30"}

Then, the correction procedure has been\nbenchmarked experimentally by means of recoil protons in elastic scattering\nreactions, where the track coordinates are precisely predictable from simple\nkinematical considerations.

In nonlinear electrokinetic phenomena, such as AC\nor induced-charge electro-osmosis (ACEO, ICEO) and induced-charge\nelectrophoresis (ICEP), several Volts $\\approx 100 kT/e$ are applied to\npolarizable surfaces in microscopic geometries, and the resulting electric\nfields and induced surface charges are large enough to violate the assumptions\nof the classical theory. In this article, we review the literature, highlight\ndiscrepancies between theory and experiment, introduce possible modifications\nof the theory, and analyze their consequences. We argue that, in response to a\nlarge applied voltage, the \"compact layer\" and \"shear plane\" effectively\nadvance into the liquid, due to the crowding of counter-ions. Using simple\ncontinuum models, we predict two general trends, each enhanced by dielectric\nresponse: (i) ionic crowding against a blocking surface expands the diffuse\ndouble layer and thus decreases its differential capacitance, and (ii) a\ncharge-induced viscosity increase near the surface reduces the electro-osmotic\nmobility. The first effect is able to predict high-frequency flow reversal in\nACEO pumps, while the second may explain the decay of ICEO flow with increasing\nsalt concentration. Through examples, such as ICEP of an uncharged metal sphere\nin an asymmetric electrolyte, we show that ICEO flows are ion-specific. Similar\nissues arise in nanofluidics (due to confinement) and ionic liquids (due to the\nlack of solvent), so the paper concludes with a general framework of modified\nelectrokinetic equations for finite-sized ions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2009 21:20:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2009 06:01:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}

Then we construct a\ncorresponding body, M(t,s), which is to lie fully within K while containing the\ngiven boundary point x.\n  In dimension 2, M is almost a regular n-gon, and the result allows to recover\nthe precise form of Blaschke's Rolling Ball Theorem in the limit. Similarly, we\nconsider the dual type discrete Blaschke theorems ensuring certain\ncircumscribed polygons. In the limit, the discrete theorem enables us to\nprovide a new proof for a strong result of Strantzen assuming only a.e.\nexistence and lower estimations on the curvature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Mar 2009 14:55:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-30"}
