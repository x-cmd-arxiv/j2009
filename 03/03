The usual way to\nincrease the light CP even Higgs mass was to increase the quartic coupling of\nthe up type Higgs. We point out that the light Higgs mass can be increased by\nreducing the off-diagonal term in the mass matrix when tan beta is moderate,\nwhich is about 5 to 10. As a result no mixing and/or a Higgs mixing angle of\nthe opposite sign arises and the branching ratio of Higgs decay is drastically\nchanged.

However, the inherent complexity of such systems\nposes serious difficulties to control design, when control objectives depart\nfrom the standard ones investigated in the current literature, e.g.\nstabilization, regulation, and etc. In this paper we propose one approach to\ncontrol design, which is based on the construction of symbolic models, where\neach symbolic state and each symbolic label correspond to an aggregate of\ncontinuous states and to an aggregate of input signals in the original system.\nThe use of symbolic models offers a systematic methodology for control design\nin which constraints coming from software and hardware, interacting with the\nphysical world, can be integrated. The main contribution of this paper is in\nshowing that incrementally input-to-state stable time-delay systems do admit\nsymbolic models that are approximately bisimilar to the original system, with a\nprecision that can be rendered as small as desired. An algorithm is also\npresented which computes the proposed symbolic models. When the state and input\nspaces of time-delay systems are bounded, which is the case in many realistic\nsituations, the proposed algorithm is shown to terminate in a finite number of\nsteps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2009 19:42:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 22 Mar 2009 04:12:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2009 23:39:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-28"}

The mean depth of the first interaction point and its\nfluctuations are a measure of the proton-air particle production cross section.\nSince the first interaction point in air cannot be measured directly, various\nmethods have been developed in the past to estimate the depth of the first\ninteraction from air shower observables in combination with simulations. As the\nsimulations depend on assumptions made for hadronic particle production at\nenergies and phase space regions not accessible in accelerator experiments, the\nderived cross sections are subject to significant systematic uncertainties. The\nfocus of this work is the development of an improved analysis technique that\nallows a significant reduction of the model dependence of the derived cross\nsection at very high energy. Performing a detailed Monte Carlo study of the\npotential and the limitations of different measurement methods, we quantify the\ndependence of the measured cross section on the used hadronic interaction\nmodel. Based on these results, a general improvement to the analysis methods is\nproposed by introducing the actually derived cross section already in the\nsimulation of reference showers.

The\nexperimental results show that magnetization relaxation is faster than 20 ns in\nthe paramagnetic state. Decreasing temperature below the Curie temperature Tc\nresults in an increase of the relaxation time but to less than 10 micro\nseconds. This fast relaxation may explain why the spontaneous spin splitting of\nelectronic states is not accompanied by the presence of non-zero macroscopic\nmagnetization below Tc. Our Monte Carlo results reproduce the relative change\nof the relaxation time on decreasing temperature. At the same time, the\nnumerical calculations demonstrate that antiferromagnetic spin-spin\ninteractions, which compete with the hole-mediated long-range ferromagnetic\ncoupling, play an important role in magnetization relaxation of the system. We\nfind, in particular, that magnetization dynamics is largely accelerated by the\npresence of antiferromagnetic couplings to the Mn spins located outside the\nregion, where the holes reside. This suggests that macroscopic spontaneous\nmagnetization should be observable if the thickness of the layer containing\nlocalized spins will be smaller than the extension of the hole wave function.\nFurthermore, we study how a spin-independent part of the Mn potential affects\nTc. Our findings show that the alloy disorder potential tends to reduce Tc, the\neffect being particularly strong for the attractive potential that leads to\nhole localization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2009 22:54:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-03"}

The setup can be viewed as that the grain is connected to\ntwo non-magnetic leads via sequential tunneling. In one lead, the chemical\npotentials for spin-up and -down electrons are split due to the spin injection\nin the NLSV. This splitting (or the spin bias) is crucial to the NLSV signal\nand the critical condition to the magnetization switching.

The question then arises under what\nconditions such square-integrable functions exist.\n  The existing literature on this subject leaves a gap between sufficient and\nnecessary criteria. In this paper, we give a characterization in terms of the\nnatural action of the dilation group $H$ on the character group of $A$. We\nfirst prove that a Calder\\'on-type resolution of the identity gives rise to a\ndecomposition of Plancherel measure of $A$ into measures on the dual orbits,\nand then show that the latter property is equivalent to regularity conditions\non the orbit space of the dual action.\n  Thus we obtain, for the first time, sharp necessary and sufficient criteria\nfor the existence of a wavelet inversion formula. As a byproduct and special\ncase of our results we obtain that discrete series subrepresentations of the\nquasiregular representation correspond precisely to dual orbits with positive\nPlancherel measure and associated compact stabilizers.

When the test statistics are\nnot independent it can be particularly challenging to deal with this problem,\nwithout resorting to very conservative procedures. In this paper we show that,\nin the context of contemporary multiple testing problems, where the number of\ntests is often very large, the difficulties caused by dependence are less\nserious than in classical cases. This is particularly true when the null\ndistributions of test statistics are relatively light-tailed, for example, when\nthey can be based on Normal or Student's $t$ approximations. There, if the test\nstatistics can fairly be viewed as being generated by a linear process, an\nanalysis founded on the incorrect assumption of independence is asymptotically\ncorrect as the number of hypotheses diverges. In particular, the point process\nrepresenting the null distribution of the indices at which statistically\nsignificant test results occur is approximately Poisson, just as in the case of\nindependence. The Poisson process also has the same mean as in the independence\ncase, and of course exhibits no clustering of false discoveries. However, this\nresult can fail if the null distributions are particularly heavy-tailed. There\nclusters of statistically significant results can occur, even when the null\nhypothesis is correct.

The algorithm gives\nsamples from the exact distribution within a finite number of iterations with\nprobability arbitrarily close to 1. The algorithm is particularly useful when a\nlarge number of samples from the same distribution is necessary, like in\nBayesian estimation, and in CPU intensive applications like, for example, in\ninverse problems and optimization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2009 10:18:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-04"}

Most WINGS clusters have $\\sigma$ between 500 and 1100 $\\rm km\ns^{-1}$, and $L_X$ between 0.2 and $5 \\times 10^{44} \\rm erg/s$. The S0\nfraction in clusters is known to increase with time at the expense of the\nspiral population. We find that the spiral and S0 fractions have evolved more\nstrongly in lower $\\sigma$, less massive clusters, while we confirm that the\nproportion of ellipticals has remained unchanged. Our results demonstrate that\nmorphological evolution since $z=1$ is not confined to massive clusters, but is\nactually more pronounced in low mass clusters, and therefore must originate\neither from secular (intrinsic) evolution and/or from environmental mechanisms\nthat act preferentially in low-mass environments, or both in low- and high-mass\nsystems. We also find that the evolution of the spiral fraction perfectly\nmirrors the evolution of the fraction of star-forming galaxies. Interestingly,\nat low-z the spiral fraction anticorrelates with $L_X$. Conversely, no\ncorrelation is observed with $\\sigma$. Given that both $\\sigma$ and $L_X$ are\ntracers of the cluster mass, these results pose a challenge for current\nscenarios of morphological evolution in clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2009 11:43:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2009 14:24:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-15"}

The main difficulty in describing these systems lies in the\nestimation of the gravitational effects of the stellar-mass compact object on\nhis own trajectory around the massive black hole, which can be modeled as the\naction of a local force, the self-force. In this paper, we present a new\ntime-domain numerical method for the computation of the self-force in a\nsimplified model consisting of a charged scalar particle orbiting a nonrotating\nblack hole. We use a multi-domain framework in such a way that the particle is\nlocated at the interface between two domains so that the presence of the\nparticle and its physical effects appear only through appropriate boundary\nconditions. In this way we eliminate completely the presence of a small length\nscale associated with the need of resolving the particle. This technique also\navoids the problems associated with the impact of a low differentiability of\nthe solution in the accuracy of the numerical computations. The spatial\ndiscretization of the field equations is done by using the pseudospectral\ncollocation method and the time evolution, based on the method of lines, uses a\nRunge-Kutta solver. We show how this special framework can provide very\nefficient and accurate computations in the time domain, which makes the\ntechnique amenable for the intensive computations required in the\nastrophysically-relevant scenarios for LISA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2009 11:52:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2009 15:12:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-12"}

Starting from\nsix points, the Ward identity allows for an arbitrary function of conformal\ninvariants to appear in the expression for the Wilson loop. We compute this\nfunction at six points and two loops and discuss its implications for the\ncorresponding gluon amplitude. It is found that the duality disagrees with a\nconjecture for the gluon amplitudes by Bern et al. A recent calculation by Bern\net al indeed shows that the latter conjecture breaks down at six gluons and at\ntwo loops. By doing a numerical comparison with their results we find that the\nduality between gluon amplitudes and Wilson loops is preserved. This review is\nbased on the author's PhD thesis and includes developments until May 2008.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2009 13:05:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

These results are\nconnected to our previous ones obtained for the $E_{7(7)}$ symmetric entropy\nformula in D=4 by observing that the structure of GQ$(2,4)$ is linked to a\nparticular kind of geometric hyperplane of the split Cayley hexagon of order\ntwo, featuring 27 points located on 9 pairwise disjoint lines (a\ndistance-3-spread). We conjecture that the different possibilities of\ndescribing the D=5 entropy formula using Jordan algebras, qubits and/or qutrits\ncorrespond to employing different coordinates for an underlying non-commutative\ngeometric structure based on GQ$(2,4)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2009 14:20:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Mar 2009 13:14:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-30"}

The observed radio spectral energy distribution (SED) covers a\nbehaviour range; 1) there are galaxies where the SED is characterized by a\nsynchrotron-type slope, 2) galaxies with a thermal slope, and 3) galaxies with\npossible free-free absorption at long wavelengths. The latter SED represents a\nsignature of massive star clusters that are still well inside the progenitor\nmolecular cloud. Based on the comparison of the star formation rates (SFR)\ndetermined from the recombination lines and those determined from the radio\nemission we find that SFR(Ha) is on average five times higher than SFR(1.4\nGHz). These results suggest that the emission of these galaxies is dominated by\na recent and massive star formation event in which the first supernovae (SN)\njust started to explode.

Detection of DM particles using multiple strategies provides\ncomplementary information that may shed light on the new physics associated\nwith the dark matter sector. In contrast to the mSUGRA model where the measured\ncold DM relic density restricts us to special regions mostly on the edge of the\nm_0-m_{1/2} plane, the entire parameter plane becomes allowed if the\nuniversality assumption is relaxed in models with just one additional\nparameter. Then, thermally produced neutralinos with a well-tempered mix of\nwino, bino and higgsino components, or with a mass adjusted so that their\nannihilation in the early universe is Higgs-resonance-enhanced, can be the DM.\nWell-tempered neutralinos typically yield heightened rates for DD and ID\nexperiments compared to generic predictions from minimal supergravity. If\ninstead DM consists of axinos (possibly together with axions) or gravitinos,\nthen there exists the possibility of detection of quasi-stable next-to-lightest\nSUSY particles at colliding beam experiments, with especially striking\nconsequences if the NLSP is charged, but no DD or ID detection.
