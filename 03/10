Much of the effort to\nstudy these new effects, like the breakdown of the conventional Fermi-liquid\ntheory of metals has been focused in narrow band electronic systems.\nFerroelectric crystals provide a very different type of quantum criticality\nthat arises purely from the crystalline lattice. In many cases the\nferroelectric phase can be tuned to absolute zero using hydrostatic pressure or\nchemical or isotopic substitution. Close to such a zero temperature phase\ntransition, the dielectric constant and other quantities change into radically\nunconventional forms due to the quantum fluctuations of the electrical\npolarization. The simplest ferroelectrics may form a text-book paradigm of\nquantum criticality in the solid-state as the difficulties found in metals due\nto a high density of gapless excitations on the Fermi surface are avoided. We\npresent low temperature high precision data demonstrating these effects in pure\nsingle crystals of SrTiO3 and KTaO3.

These models arise in situations that involve a very\nlarge number of agents moving from state to state according to certain\noptimality criteria. The mean field approach for optimal control and\ndifferential games (continuous state and time) was introduced by Lasry and\nLions. Here we consider a discrete version of the problem. Our setting is the\nfollowing: we assume that there is a very large number of identical agents\nwhich can be in a finite number of states. Because the number of agents is very\nlarge, we assume the mean field hypothesis, that is, that the only relevant\ninformation for the global evolution is the fraction $\\pi^n_i$ of players in\neach state $i$ at time $n$. The agents look for minimizing a running cost,\nwhich depends on $\\pi$, plus a terminal cost $V^N$. In contrast with optimal\ncontrol, where usually only the terminal cost $V^N$ is necessary to solve the\nproblem, in mean-field games both the initial distribution of agents $\\pi^0$\nand the terminal cost $V^N$ are necessary to determine the solutions, that is,\nthe distribution of players $\\pi^n$ and value function $V^n$, for $0\\leq n\\leq\nN$. Because both initial and terminal data needs to be specified, we call this\nproblem the initial-terminal value problem. Existence of solutions is\nnon-trivial. Nevertheless, following the ideas of Lasry and Lions, we were able\nto establish existence and uniqueness, both for the stationary and for the\ninitial-terminal value problems.

Two closed space curves have long been known\nby mathematicians to exhibit a property called the linking number, a\ntopologically invariant integer, expressible as the sum of two other\nquantities, the twist of one of the curves about the other, and the writhing\nnumber, or writhe, a measure of the chiral distortion from planarity of one of\nthe two closed curves.

In addition, the results are compared to\nprevious results for M-type AGB stars and carbon stars to look for trends with\nchemical type. The circumstellar envelopes are assumed to be spherically\nsymmetric and formed by a constant mass-loss rate. The mass-loss rates are\nestimated from fitting the CO observations using a non-local, non-LTE radiative\ntransfer code. Once the physical properties of the circumstellar envelopes are\ndetermined, the same radiative transfer code is used to model the observed SiO\nlines in order to derive circumstellar abundances and the sizes of the SiO\nline-emitting regions. We have estimated mass-loss rates of 40 S-type AGB stars\nand find that the derived mass-loss rates have a distribution that resembles\nthose previously derived for similar samples of M-type AGB stars and carbon\nstars. The estimated mass-loss rates also correlate well with the corresponding\nexpansion velocity. In all, this indicates that the mass loss is driven by the\nsame mechanism in all three chemical types of AGB stars. In addition, we have\nestimated the circumstellar fractional abundance of SiO relative to H2 in 26 of\nthe sample S-type AGB stars. The derived SiO abundances are, on average, about\nan order of magnitude higher than predicted by stellar atmosphere thermal\nequilibrium chemistry, indicating that non-equilibrium chemical processes\ndetermines the abundance of SiO in the circumstellar envelope. Moreover, a\ncomparison with the results for M-type AGB stars and carbon stars show that for\na certain mass-loss rate, the circumstellar SiO abundance seems independent\n(although with a large scatter) of the C/O-ratio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2009 13:21:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Angular momentum conservation during the\ncollapse results in the progressive increase of the centrifugal force, which\neventually halts the inflow of material and leads to the development of a\ncentral mass surrounded by a disc. In the presence of an angular momentum\ntransport mechanism, mass accretion onto the central object proceeds through\nthis disc, and it is believed that this is how stars typically gain most of\ntheir mass. However, the mechanisms responsible for this transport of angular\nmomentum are not well understood.

The final X-ray picture is\nobtained by calculating analytically the expected surface brightness and\nweighted temperature of each component. All of our X-ray models have an\nexplicit dependence on metallicity and admit general emissivities as functions\nof the hydrodynamical variables. We consider a realistic X-ray emissivity that\nseparates the contributions from hydrogen and metals. The paper ends with a\ncomparison of the models with observational data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2009 04:33:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

To further investigate the LF (low frequency) and HF (high frequency)\ncomponents of the signals, we have designed a mathematical model of LH\nplasmatic level accounting for the effect of experimental sampling times. The\nmodel enables us to confirm the existence of an endogenous circannual rhythm,\nto investigate the action mechanism of photoperiod on the pulsatile pattern of\nLH secretion (control of the interpulse interval) and to conclude that the HF\ncomponent is mainly due to the experimental sampling protocol.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2009 07:15:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-14"}

Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are ideal candidates due to their large\nflux over limited time intervals, maximizing the available signal-to-noise\nratio. To date a few polarization measurements have been reported, claiming of\na high degree of polarization in the prompt emission of GRBs but with low\nstatistical evidence.\n  We used the IBIS telescope on board the INTEGRAL satellite to measure the\npolarization of the prompt gamma-ray emission of the long and bright GRB\n041219A in the 200-800 keV energy band. We find a variable degree of\npolarization ranging from less than 4% over the first peak to 43+/-25% for the\nwhole second peak. Time resolved analysis of both peaks indicates a high degree\nof polarization, and the null average polarization in the first peak can be\nexplained by the rapid variations observed in the polarization angle and\ndegree.\n  Our results are consistent with different models for the prompt emission of\nGRBs at these energies, but they favor synchrotron radiation from a\nrelativistic outflow with a magnetic field which is coherent on an angular size\ncomparable with the angular size of the emitting region (~1/Gamma) .

They appear\nspontaneously in several 2D disc simulations and they are known to accelerate\nplanetesimal formation through a dust trapping process. However, the issue of\nthe stability of these structures to the imposition of 3D disturbances is still\nnot fully understood, and it casts doubts on their long term survival.\n  Aim: We present new results on the 3D stability of elliptical vortices\nembedded in accretion discs, based on a linear analysis and several non-linear\nsimulations.\n  Methods: We derive the linearised equations governing the 3D perturbations in\nthe core of an elliptical vortex, and we show that they can be reduced to a\nFloquet problem. We solve this problem numerically in the astrophysical regime\nand we present several analytical limits for which the mechanism responsible\nfor the instability can be explained. Finally, we compare the results of the\nlinear analysis to some high resolution simulations.\n  Results: We show that most anticyclonic vortices are unstable due to a\nresonance between the turnover time and the local epicyclic oscillation period.\nIn addition, we demonstrate that a strong vertical stratification does not\ncreate any additional stable domain of aspect ratio, but it significantly\nreduces growth rates for relatively weak (and therefore elongated) vortices.\n  Conclusions: Elliptical vortices are always unstable, whatever the horizontal\nor vertical aspect-ratio is. The instability can however be weak and is often\nfound at small scales, making it difficult to detect in low-order\nfinite-difference simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2009 09:55:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The overall drying time is minimum in this regime and is\nindependent of contact angle over a large range of contact angles up to the\nbeginning of a transition zone. As the contact angle increases in the\ntransition region, the cooperative smoothing mechanisms of the interface become\nimportant and the width of the liquid gas interface fingers that form during\nthe evaporation process increases.

In\nthis paper we investigate the influence of tag suggestions on the emergence of\npower law distributions as a result of collaborative tag behavior. Although\nprevious research has already shown that power laws emerge in tagging systems,\nthe cause of why power law distributions emerge is not understood empirically.\nThe majority of theories and mathematical models of tagging found in the\nliterature assume that the emergence of power laws in tagging systems is mainly\ndriven by the imitation behavior of users when observing tag suggestions\nprovided by the user interface of the tagging system. This imitation behavior\nleads to a feedback loop in which some tags are reinforced and get more popular\nwhich is also known as the `rich get richer' or a preferential attachment\nmodel. We present experimental results that show that the power law\ndistribution forms regardless of whether or not tag suggestions are presented\nto the users. Furthermore, we show that the real effect of tag suggestions is\nrather subtle; the resulting power law distribution is `compressed' if tag\nsuggestions are given to the user, resulting in a shorter long tail and a\n`compressed' top of the power law distribution. The consequences of this\nexperiment show that tag suggestions by themselves do not account for the\nformation of power law distributions in tagging systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2009 14:48:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-11"}

These are then resummed to all orders using\nnon-linear sigma-model techniques familiar from models of collective breaking.\nGenerically, flavor diagonal CP violating (CPV) sources in the UV can induce\nO(1) CPV in processes involving third generation quarks.
