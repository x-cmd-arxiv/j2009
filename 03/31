Only interferometric observations provide the necessary\nangular resolution to resolve the nuclear dust and to study its distribution\nand properties. The investigation of dust in AGN cores is hence one of the main\nscience goals for the MID-infrared Interferometric instrument MIDI at the VLTI.\nAs the first step, the feasibility of AGN observations was verified and the\nmost promising sources for detailed studies were identified. This was carried\nout in a \"snapshot survey\" with MIDI using Guaranteed Time Observations. In the\nsurvey, observations were attempted for 13 of the brightest AGN in the\nmid-infrared which are visible from Paranal. The results of the three\nbrightest, best studied sources have been published in separate papers. Here we\npresent the interferometric observations for the remaining 10, fainter AGN. For\n8 of these, interferometric measurements could be carried out. Size estimates\nor limits on the spatial extent of the AGN-heated dust were derived from the\ninterferometric data of 7 AGN. These indicate that the dust distributions are\ncompact, with sizes on the order of a few parsec. The derived sizes roughly\nscale with the square root of the luminosity in the mid-infrared, s ~ sqrt(L),\nwith no clear distinction between type 1 and type 2 objects. This is in\nagreement with a model of nearly optically thick dust structures heated to T ~\n300 K. For three sources, the 10 micron feature due to silicates is tentatively\ndetected either in emission or in absorption. Based on the results for all AGN\nstudied with MIDI so far, we conclude that in the mid-infrared the differences\nbetween individual galactic nuclei are greater than the generic differences\nbetween type 1 and type 2 objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2009 19:07:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2009 20:11:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}

The detection of these features is only marginally significant from\ntemperature data alone.

The Planck satellite has the statistical sensitivity to\nconfirm or rule out the model that best fits the temperature features with 3\nsigma significance, assuming all other parameters are known.

The data was collected from the CDF II detector in a set of runs with\na total integrated luminosity of 1.1 fb^{-1}. The cross section is measured in\nthe dilepton channel, the subset of ttbar events in which both top quarks decay\nthrough t -> Wb -> l nu b where l = e, mu, or tau. The lepton pair is\nreconstructed as one identified electron or muon and one isolated track. The\nuse of an isolated track to identify the second lepton increases the ttbar\nacceptance, particularly for the case in which one W decays as W -> tau nu. The\npurity of the sample may be further improved at the cost of a reduction in the\nnumber of signal events, by requiring an identified b-jet.

We show that the most efficient\nobservational strategy to address these questions is to carry out a large-area\nX-ray survey, reaching a sensitivity comparable to that of deep Chandra and XMM\npointings, but extending over several thousands of square degrees. Such a\nsurvey can only be carried out with a Wide-Field X-ray Telescope (WFXT) with a\nhigh survey speed, due to the combination of large field of view and large\neffective area, i.e., grasp, and sharp PSF.

So far, all such experiments have operated in a regime of weak\ncoupling, in which reversible energy exchange between the mechanical device and\nits coupled partner is suppressed by fast decoherence of the individual systems\nto their local environments. Controlled quantum experiments are in principle\nnot possible in such a regime, but instead require strong coupling.

The\ntightest limit on the distance of an X-ray warm absorber from the ionizing\nsource is that of Krongold et al. (2007) for NGC 4051. We use NGC 4051 to model\nother observed UV outflows, and find that on the whole they may not provide\nmeaningful feedback. The outflow velocities are below or just above the escape\nvelocity of the black hole. This may be because they are not yet fully\naccelerated, or the duty cycle of high-velocity outflows may be small. Another\npossibility is that they may only provide meaningful feedback in\nhigher-luminosity AGN, as we find a weak correlation between the ratio of\noutflow velocity to escape velocity and AGN continuum luminosity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2009 20:26:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-01"}

The morphology of this galaxy resembles the recently\nidentified class of ultraviolet objects called extended ultraviolet disks, or\nXUV-disks. New HI observations of this galaxy taken at the ATCA and in the CnB\narray at the VLA show that the cold gas lies in an extended (diameter ~90 kpc)\nring around the central S0 galaxy. The HI data cube can be well modeled by a\nwarped ring. The faint ionized gas in the inner parts of the galaxy is\nkinematically decoupled from the stars and instead appears to exhibit\nvelocities consistent with the rotation of the HI ring at larger radius. The\npeak of the stellar ring, as seen in the optical and UV, is slightly displaced\nto the inside relative to the peak of the HI ring. We discuss the manner in\nwhich this offset could be caused by the propagation of a radial density wave\nthrough an existing stellar disk, perhaps triggered by a galaxy collision at\nthe center of the disk, or possibly due to a spiral density wave set up at\nearly times in a disk too hot to form a stellar bar. Gas accretion and\nresonance effects due to a bar which has since dissolved are also considered to\nexplain the presence of the star forming ring seen in the GALEX and deep\noptical data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2009 22:00:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

First, we find that\nbidisperse, disordered foams exhibit strongly rate dependent and inhomogeneous\n(shear banded) velocity profiles, while monodisperse, ordered foams are also\nshear banded, but essentially rate independent. Second, we introduce a simple\nmodel based on balancing the averaged drag forces between the bubbles and the\ntop plate and the averaged bubble-bubble drag forces. This model captures the\nobserved rate dependent flows, and the rate independent flows. Third, we\nperform independent rheological measurements, both for ordered and disordered\nsystems, and find these to be fully consistent with the scaling forms of the\ndrag forces assumed in the simple model, and we see that disorder modifies the\nscaling.

Surprisingly, our model describes flow\nprofiles and rate dependence over the whole range of packing fractions with the\nsame power law exponents -- only a dimensionless number $k$ which measures the\nratio of the pre-factors of the viscous drag laws is seen to vary with packing\nfraction. We find that $k \\sim (\\phi-\\phi_c)^{-1}$, where $\\phi_c \\approx\n0.84$, corresponding to the 2d jamming density, and suggest that this scaling\nfollows from the geometry of the deformed facets between bubbles in contact.\nOverall, our work suggests a route to rationalize aspects of the ubiquitous\nHerschel-Bulkley (power law) rheology observed in a wide range of disordered\nmaterials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2009 14:20:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

We find no new features beyond the\nregion previously mapped, and show that all six spatially-resolved features on\nboth the eastern and western sides (three on each side) comprise radially\naligned filaments. Such radial filaments can be most naturally explained by a\nmodel in which gas deposited \"upstream\" in localized regions experiencing an\nX-ray cooling flow subsequently free falls along the gravitational potential of\nPerA, as we previously showed can explain the observed kinematics of the two\nlongest filaments. All the detected filaments coincide with locally bright\nHalpha features, and have a ratio in CO(2-1) to Halpha luminosity of ~1e-3; we\nshow that these filaments have lower star formation efficiencies than the\nnearly constant value found for molecular gas in nearby normal spiral galaxies.\nOn the other hand, some at least equally luminous Halpha features, including a\npreviously identified giant HII region, show no detectable cool molecular gas\nwith a corresponding ratio at least a factor of ~5 lower; in the giant HII\nregion, essentially all the pre-existing molecular gas may have been converted\nto stars. We demonstrate that all the cool molecular filaments are\ngravitationally bound, and without any means of support beyond thermal pressure\nshould collapse on timescales ~< 1e6yrs. By comparison, as we showed previously\nthe two longest filaments have much longer dynamical ages of ~1e7yrs. Tidal\nshear may help delay their collapse, but more likely turbulent velocities of at\nleast a few tens km/s or magnetic fields with strengths of at least several\n~10uG are required to support these filaments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2009 09:17:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

At low\nmixing concentration, electrostatic complexes made from cationic-neutral\ncopolymers and alkyl sulfate surfactants exhibit spherical core-shell\nmicrostructures. With increasing concentration, the complexes undergo a\nsphere-to-cylinder transition, yielding elongated aggregates with diameter 50\nnm and length up to several hundreds of nanometers. From the comparison between\nhomo- and diblock polymer phase behaviors, it is suggested that the\nunidimensional growth is driven by the ability of the surfactant to\nself-assemble into cylindrical micelles, and in particular when these\nsurfactants are complexed with oppositely charged polymers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2009 10:50:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-01"}

The fundamental notion of the limiting phase trajectory\n(LPT) corresponding to complete energy exchange is introduced. At first we\npropose a simple analytical description of vibrations of nonlinear oscillators.\nWe show that two dynamical transitions occur in the system. First of them\ncorresponds to the bifurcation of anti-phase vibrations of oscillators. And the\nsecond one is caused by coincidence of LPT with separatrix dividing two stable\nstationary states and leads to qualitative change in both phase and temporal\nbehavior of the LPT. Next problem under consideration relates to intensive\nintermodal exchange in the periodic nonlinear systems with finite (n>2) number\nof degrees of freedom. We consider two limiting cases. If the number of\nparticles is not large enough, the energy exchange between nonlinear normal\nmodes in two-dimensional integral manifolds is considered. When the number of\nthe particles increases the energy exchange between neighbor integral manifolds\nbecomes important that leads to formation of the localized excitations\nresembling the breathers in the one-dimensional continuum media.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2009 22:14:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-01"}

By comparing the densities on the\nreversible branches obtained for a range of values of T, we find that we can\ncollapse all data when plotted as function of A/T, which scales similar to both\nthe liftoff velocity and the time of flight of the packing. We further show\nthat switching between states obtained for different A and T, but chosen such\nthat their densities on the reversible branches match, does not lead to\nappreciable hysteresis. We conclude that the appropriate control parameter for\nsinusoidal tapping is not the peak acceleration \\Gamma \\sim A/T^2, as is\nusually assumed, but rather \\Gamma T \\sim A/T.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2009 15:47:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2009 16:06:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2010 17:46:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

Some dynamical properties of solitons on external potentials are\nstudied with both numerical methods and analytical methods. In this paper, we\npropose a method to deal with such oscillation modes of solitons in potential\nwells. We show that oscillations of a soliton is described by the Klein-Gordon\nequation with an external potential. Although this analysis does not seems to\ngive quantitative scattering amplitude of a soliton itself, it explains\nqualitative pictures of scattering. As a result of our analysis, when a soliton\nis scattered in a cyclic potential, the Laue pattern emerges. Furthermore,\nsince our analysis is based on the Klein-Gordon equation, a discrete frequency\nspectrum of a soliton is obtained when it is bounded by some potentials. What\nis especially important is that this analysis predicts a frequency spectrum of\na soliton in the Coulomb potential and then we find that this system absorbs\nexternal waves with specific frequencies described by the Rydberg formula.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2009 15:36:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-01"}

We calculate the\nmasses, electromagnetic decays, and E1 transitions of charmonium states in the\nscreened potential model, and propose possible assignments for the newly\ndiscovered charmonium or charmonium-like $\"X,Y,Z\"$ states. We find the masses\nof higher charmonia with screened potential are considerably lower than those\nwith unscreened potential. The $\\chi_{c2}(2P)$ mass agrees well with that of\nthe Z(3930), and the mass of $\\psi(4415)$ is compatible with $\\psi(5S)$ rather\nthan $\\psi(4S)$. In particular, the discovered four $Y$ states in the ISR\nprocess, i.e., $Y(4008), Y(4260), Y(4320/4360), Y(4660)$ may be assigned as the\n$\\psi(3S), \\psi(4S), \\psi(3D), \\psi(6S)$ states respectively.
