We obtain a parameterized stellar-to-halo mass (SHM) relation by\npopulating halos and subhalos in an N-body simulation with galaxies and\nrequiring that the observed stellar mass function be reproduced. We find good\nagreement with constraints from galaxy-galaxy lensing and predictions of\nsemi-analytic models. Using this mapping, and the positions of the halos and\nsubhalos obtained from the simulation, we find that our model predictions for\nthe galaxy two-point correlation function (CF) as a function of stellar mass\nare in excellent agreement with the observed clustering properties in the SDSS\nat z=0. We show that the clustering data do not provide additional strong\nconstraints on the SHM function and conclude that our model can therefore\npredict clustering as a function of stellar mass. We compute the conditional\nmass function, which yields the average number of galaxies with stellar masses\nin the range [m, m+dm] that reside in a halo of mass M. We study the redshift\ndependence of the SHM relation and show that, for low mass halos, the SHM ratio\nis lower at higher redshift. The derived SHM relation is used to predict the\nstellar mass dependent galaxy CF and bias at high redshift. Our model predicts\nthat not only are massive galaxies more biased than low mass ones at all\nredshifts, but the bias increases more rapidly with increasing redshift for\nmassive galaxies than for low mass ones. We present convenient fitting\nfunctions for the SHM relation as a function of redshift, the conditional mass\nfunction, and the bias as a function of stellar mass and redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Mar 2009 17:38:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2009 13:02:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-28"}

Biochemical analogue of Nash equilibrium,\nproposed here, could measure the robustness in TCA cycle in exact numeric\nterms, whereas the mixed strategy game between these entropies could quantitate\nthe progression of stages of biological adaptation.

Pulsation modes fall into different categories, the three\nmain ones being island, chaotic, and whispering gallery modes, which are\nrotating counterparts to modes with low, medium, and high l-|m| values,\nrespectively. The frequencies of the island modes follow an asymptotic pattern\nquite similar to what was found for polytropic models. Extending this\nasymptotic formula to higher azimuthal orders reveals more subtle behaviour as\na function of m and provides a first estimate of the average advection of\npulsation modes by rotation. Further calculations based on a variational\nprinciple confirm this estimate and provide rotation kernels that could be used\nin inversion methods. When the rotation profile becomes highly differential, it\nbecomes more and more difficult to find island and whispering gallery modes at\nlow azimuthal orders. At high azimuthal orders, whispering gallery modes, and\nin some cases island modes, reappear.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Mar 2009 17:17:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

First we demonstrate that some\nsize evolution of the population can be expected simply due to the continuous\nemergence of early-type galaxies. SDSS data reveal that in the present-day\nuniverse more compact early-type galaxies with a given dynamical mass have\nolder stellar populations. In contrast, at a given stellar velocity dispersion,\nSDSS data show that there is no relation between size and age, which implies\nthat the velocity dispersion can be used to estimate the epoch at which\ngalaxies stopped forming stars, turning into early-type galaxies. Applying such\na 'formation' criterion to a large sample of nearby early-type galaxies, we\npredict the redshift evolution in the size distribution and the comoving mass\ndensity. The resulting evolution in the mean size is roughly half of the\nobserved evolution. Then we include a prescription for the merger histories of\ngalaxies between the 'formation' redshift and the present, based on\ncosmological simulations of the assembly of dark matter halos. Such mergers\nafter the transformation into an early-type galaxy are presumably\ndissipationless ('dry'), where the increase in size is expected to be\napproximately proportional to the increase in mass. This model successfully\nreproduces the observed evolution since z~2 in the mean size and in the\ncomoving mass density of massive early-type galaxies. We conclude that the\nrecently measured, substantial size evolution of early-type galaxies can be\nexplained by the combined effect of the continuous emergence of galaxies as\nearly types and their subsequent growth through dry merging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Mar 2009 17:18:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2009 14:00:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 2009 16:31:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

A prior information composed of\ncorrelations among a large set of N variables, is encoded into a graphical\nmodel; this encoding is optimized with respect to an approximate decoding\nprocedure LBP, which is used to infer hidden variables from an observed subset.\nWe focus on the situation where the underlying data have many different\nstatistical components, representing a variety of independent patterns.\nConsidering a single parameter family of models we show how LBP may be used to\nencode and decode efficiently such information, without solving the NP hard\ninverse problem yielding the optimal MRF. Contrary to usual practice, we work\nin the non-convex Bethe free energy minimization framework, and manage to\nassociate a belief propagation fixed point to each component of the underlying\nprobabilistic mixture.

A corollary of this finding is that\nthe Fermi velocity, as measured over this energy range, varies rapidly with\ntemperature - increasing by almost 30% from 70 to 110 K.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Mar 2009 20:12:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2009 00:04:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2009 21:56:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-27"}

Here we present new panoramic\nSpitzer/MIPS 24micron observations of the merging cluster Abell 1758 at z=0.279\nspanning 6.5x6.5Mpc and reaching a 90% completeness limit of 400uJy. We\nestimate a global cluster SFR of 910\\pm320 M_sun/yr within 3 Mpc of the cluster\ncentre, originating from 42 galaxies with L_IR > 5x10^10 L_sun. The obscured\nactivity in A1758 is therefore comparable with that in Cl 0024+1654, the most\nactive cluster previously studied at 24um. The obscured galaxies faithfully\ntrace the cluster potential as revealed by the weak-lensing mass map of the\ncluster, including numerous mass peaks at R~2-3Mpc that are likely associated\nwith infalling galaxy groups and filamentary structures. However the core\n(R<500kpc) of A1758N is 2x more active in the IR than that of A1758S, likely\nreflecting differences in the recent dynamical history of the two clusters. The\n24micron results from A1758 therefore suggest that dust-obscured cluster\ngalaxies are common in merging clusters and suggests that obscured activity in\nclusters is triggered by both the details of cluster-cluster mergers and\nprocesses that operate at larger radii including those within in-falling\ngroups. Our ongoing far-UV through far-IR observations of a large sample of\nclusters should allow us to disentangle the different physical processes\nresponsible for triggering obscured star formation in clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Mar 2009 21:43:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Recent work has emphasized the importance of radiative\ntransfer calculations due to the high optical depth in the HI Lyman lines.\nTransfer in the Lyman-alpha line is dominated by true emission and absorption,\nHubble expansion, and resonant scattering. Resonant scattering causes photons\nto diffuse in frequency due to random kicks from the thermal velocities of\nhydrogen atoms, and also to drift toward lower frequencies due to energy loss\nvia atomic recoil. Past analyses of Lyman-alpha transfer during the\nrecombination era have either considered a subset of these processes, ignored\ntime dependence, or incorrectly assumed identical emission and absorption\nprofiles. We present here a fully time-dependent radiative transfer calculation\nof the Lyman-alpha line including all of these processes, and compare it to\nprevious results that ignored the resonant scattering. We find a faster\nrecombination due to recoil enhancement of the Lyman-alpha escape rate, leading\nto a reduction in the free electron density of 0.45% at z=900. This results in\nan increase in the small-scale CMB power spectrum that is negligible for the\ncurrent data but will be a 0.9 sigma correction for Planck.

It is found that if galaxies are aligned\nby large-scale tidal fields, then these selection effects give rise to a\ndependence of the observed galaxy density on the local tidal field, in addition\nto the well-known dependences on the matter density and radial velocity\ngradient. This alters the galaxy power spectrum in a way that is different for\nFourier modes parallel to and perpendicular to the line of sight. These tidal\ngalaxy alignments can thus mimic redshift space distortions, and thus result in\na bias in the measurement of the velocity power spectrum. If galaxy\norientations are affected only by the local tidal field, then the tidal\nalignment effect has exactly the same scale and angular dependence as the\nredshift space distortions in the linear regime, so it cannot be projected out\nor removed by masking small scales in the analysis. We consider several toy\nmodels of tidal alignments and orientation-dependent selection, normalize their\nfree parameter (an amplitude) to recent observations, and find that they could\nbias the velocity amplitude f(z)G(z) by 5--10 per cent in some models, although\nmost models give much smaller contamination.

With the introduction of Babcock's photoelectric magnetograph it\nsoon became clear that the Sun's magnetic field outside sunspots is extremely\nstructured. The field strengths that were measured were found to get larger\nwhen the spatial resolution was improved. It was therefore necessary to come up\nwith methods to go beyond the spatial resolution limit and diagnose the\nintrinsic magnetic-field properties without dependence on the quality of the\ntelescope used. The line-ratio technique that was developed in the early 1970s\nrevealed a picture where most flux that we see in magnetograms originates in\nhighly bundled, kG fields with a tiny volume filling factor. This led to\ninterpretations in terms of discrete, strong-field magnetic flux tubes embedded\nin a rather field-free medium, and a whole industry of flux tube models at\nincreasing levels of sophistication. This magnetic-field paradigm has now been\nshattered with the advent of high-precision imaging polarimeters that allow us\nto apply the so-called \"Second Solar Spectrum\" to diagnose aspects of solar\nmagnetism that have been hidden to Zeeman diagnostics. It is found that the\nbulk of the photospheric volume is seething with intermediately strong, tangled\nfields.

In particular, its spectrum can be described in terms of Bethe\nroots. The large deviation function of the current can be obtained as well by\ndiagonalizing a modified transition matrix, that is still integrable: the\nspectrum of this new matrix can be also described in terms of Bethe roots for\nspecial values of the parameters. However, due to the algebraic framework used\nto write the Bethe equations in the previous works, the nature of the\nexcitations and the full structure of the eigenvectors were still unknown. This\npaper explains why the eigenvectors of the modified transition matrix are\nphysically relevant, gives an explicit expression for the eigenvectors and\napplies it to the study of atypical currents. It also shows how the coordinate\nBethe Ansatz developped for the excitations leads to a simple derivation of the\nBethe equations and of the validity conditions of this Ansatz. All the results\nobtained by de Gier and Essler are recovered and the approach gives a physical\ninterpretation of the exceptional points The overlap of this approach with\nother tools such as the matrix Ansatz is also discussed. The method that is\npresented here may be not specific to the asymmetric exclusion process and may\nbe applied to other models with open boundaries to find similar exceptional\npoints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Mar 2009 14:33:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2009 14:16:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}
