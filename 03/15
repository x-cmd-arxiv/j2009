We study examples of different behavior allowed in a CPL\nparametrization in a phase diagram, and relate these to effects on the\nobservables.

In such fields inertial\ncavitation is often observed. Classically, estimations of cavitation thresholds\nhave been based on the assumption that the incident wave at the surface of a\nbubble was the same as in the far-field, neglecting the effect of nonlinear\nwave propagation. By modelling the incident wave as a solution to Burgers'\nequation using weak shock theory, the effects of nonlinear wave propagation on\ninertial cavitation are investigated using both numerical and analytical\ntechniques. From radius-time curves for a single bubble, it is observed that\nthere is a reduction in the maximum size of a bubble undergoing inertial\ncavitation and that the inertial collapse occurs earlier in contrast with the\nclassical case. Corresponding stability thresholds for a bubble whose initial\nradius is slightly below the critical Blake radius are calculated. Bifurcation\ndiagrams and frequency-response curves are presented associated with the loss\nof stability. The consequences and physical implications of the results are\ndiscussed with respect to the classical results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Mar 2009 15:57:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-06"}

It is\nshown that such singularity may occur even in flat spacetime for the specific\nchoice of the effective potential. The conditions for the avoidance of\nfinite-time singularities are presented and discussed. The problem is reduced\nto the study of a scalar field evolving on an effective potential by using the\nconformal transformations. Some viable modified gravity models are analyzed in\ndetail and the way to cure singularity is considered by introducing the\nhigher-order curvature corrections. These results maybe relevant for the\nresolution of the conjectured problem in the relativistic star formation in\nsuch modified gravity where finite-time singularity is also manifested.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Mar 2009 19:02:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2009 14:06:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-30"}
