We have included many new effects in the current study,\nincluding a variety of particle masses and accretion rates, nuclear burning,\nfeedback mechanisms, and possible repopulation of DM density due to capture.\nRemarkably, we find that in all these cases, we obtain the same result: the\nfirst stars are very large, 500-1000 times as massive as the Sun; as well as\npuffy (radii 1-10 A.U.), bright ($10^6-10^7 L_\\odot$), and cool ($T_{surf} <\n$10,000 K) during the accretion. These results differ markedly from the\nstandard picture in the absence of DM heating. Hence DS should be\nobservationally distinct from standard Pop III stars. In addition, DS avoid the\n(unobserved) element enrichment produced by the standard first stars. Once the\ndark matter fuel is exhausted, the DS becomes a heavy main sequence star; these\nstars eventually collapse to form massive black holes that may provide seeds\nfor the supermassive black holes and intermediate black holes, and explain\nARCADE data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2009 17:42:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

We give explicit formulas\nfor the scaling of charge e/2 and charge e/4 quasiparticle contributions to the\ncurrent as a function of temperature, gate voltage and distance between the two\npoint contacts for all three models. Based on these, we analyze several\npossible explanations of two phenomena reported for recent experiments by\nWillett et al., namely halving of the period of the observed resistance\noscillations with rising temperature and alternation between the same two\nobserved periods at low temperatures as the area of the interference loop is\nvaried with a side gate. We conclude that the most likely explanation is that\nthe observed alternation is due to switching between even and odd numbers of\ncharge e/4 quasiparticles enclosed within the loop as a function of side gate\nvoltage, which is a clear signature of the presence of non-Abelian anyons.\nHowever, there are important features of the data which do not have a simple\nexplanation within this picture.

One crucial step when studying the structure and dynamics of\nnetworks is to identify communities: groups of related nodes that correspond to\nfunctional subunits such as protein complexes or social spheres. Communities in\nnetworks often overlap such that nodes simultaneously belong to several groups.\nMeanwhile, many networks are known to possess hierarchical organization, where\ncommunities are recursively grouped into a hierarchical structure. However, the\nfact that many real networks have communities with pervasive overlap, where\neach and every node belongs to more than one group, has the consequence that a\nglobal hierarchy of nodes cannot capture the relationships between overlapping\ngroups. Here we reinvent communities as groups of links rather than nodes and\nshow that this unorthodox approach successfully reconciles the antagonistic\norganizing principles of overlapping communities and hierarchy. In contrast to\nthe existing literature, which has entirely focused on grouping nodes, link\ncommunities naturally incorporate overlap while revealing hierarchical\norganization. We find relevant link communities in many networks, including\nmajor biological networks such as protein-protein interaction and metabolic\nnetworks, and show that a large social network contains hierarchically\norganized community structures spanning inner-city to regional scales while\nmaintaining pervasive overlap. Our results imply that link communities are\nfundamental building blocks that reveal overlap and hierarchical organization\nin networks to be two aspects of the same phenomenon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2009 19:03:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2009 20:58:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2010 20:56:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-16"}

In 1976, Erd\\H{o}s and Szemeredi gave a proof of the conjecture\nfor sufficiently large primes $n$. However, the proof was complicated enough\nthat the details for small primes were never worked out. Both in the paper of\nErd\\H{o}s and Szemeredi and in a later survey by Erd\\H{o}s and Graham, the\ncomplexity of the proof was lamented. Recently, a new proof, valid even for\nnon-primes $n$, was given by Gao, Hamidoune and Wang, using Savchev and Chen's\nrecently proved structure theorem for zero-sum free sequences of long length in\n$C_n$. However, as this is a fairly involved result, they did not believe it to\nbe the simple proof sought by Erd\\H{o}s, Graham and Szemeredi. In this paper,\nwe give a short proof of the original conjecture that uses only the\nCauchy-Davenport Theorem and pigeonhole principle, thus perhaps qualifying as a\nsimple proof. Replacing the use of the Cauchy-Davenport Theorem with the\nDevos-Goddyn-Mohar Theorem, we obtain an alternate proof, albeit not as simple,\nof the non-prime case. Additionally, our method yields an exhaustive list\ndetailing the precise structure of $S$ and works for an arbitrary finite\nabelian group, though the only non-cyclic group for which this is nontrivial is\n$C_2\\oplus C_{2m}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2009 16:54:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-19"}

While it presents new opportunities for research,\nChIP-seq poses new challenges for statistical analysis that derive from the\ncomplexity of the biological systems characterized and the variability and\nbiases in its digital sequence data. We propose a method called PICS\n(Probabilistic Inference for ChIP-seq) for extracting information from ChIP-seq\naligned-read data in order to identify regions bound by transcription factors.\nPICS identifies enriched regions by modeling local concentrations of\ndirectional reads, and uses DNA fragment length prior information to\ndiscriminate closely adjacent binding events via a Bayesian hierarchical\nt-mixture model. Its per-event fragment length estimates also allow it to\nremove from analysis regions that have atypical lengths. PICS uses\npre-calculated, whole-genome read mappability profiles and a truncated\nt-distribution to adjust binding event models for reads that are missing due to\nlocal genome repetitiveness. It estimates uncertainties in model parameters\nthat can be used to define confidence regions on binding event locations and to\nfilter estimates. Finally, PICS calculates a per-event enrichment score\nrelative to a control sample, and can use a control sample to estimate a false\ndiscovery rate. We compared PICS to the alternative methods MACS, QuEST, and\nCisGenome, using published GABP and FOXA1 data sets from human cell lines, and\nfound that PICS' predicted binding sites were more consistent with\ncomputationally predicted binding motifs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2009 17:20:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-19"}

As for non-circular bound orbits, the SRP dampens the\nrate at which the perihelion is shifted due to curved spacetime, while the\nperihelion shift due to the oblateness of the sun is increased. With regards to\nthe Lense-Thirring effect, the SRP increases the angle of precession of polar\norbits during one orbital period, although the precession frequency is not\nactually altered. We also consider non-Keplerian orbits, which lie outside of\nthe plane of the sun. In particular, we investigate how the pitch angle of the\nsolar sail is affected by the partial absorption of light by the sail, general\nrelativistic effects, and the oblateness of the sun. Non-Keplerian orbits\nexhibit an analog of the Lense-Thirring effect, in that the orbital plane\nprecesses around the sun. A near-solar mission for observations of these\neffects could provide an interesting confirmation of these phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2009 17:56:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2009 23:54:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

The estimated rates of exogenous events suffer from\nlarge errors. The key branching ratio $n$, quantifying the fraction of events\nthat have been triggered by previous events, is also badly estimated in general\nfrom declustered catalogs. We find however that the errors tend to be smaller\nand perhaps acceptable in some cases for small triggering efficiency and\nbranching ratios.

We\nestimate the necessary sensitivity for detecting low density WHIM gas with the\nSouth Pole Telescope (SPT) and Planck Surveyor for a synthetic 100 square\ndegree sky survey. This survey is generated from a very large, high dynamic\nrange adaptive mesh refinement cosmological simulation performed with the Enzo\ncode.

For a Planck-like satellite, similar detections are possible with a\nmore significant increase in sensitivity (a factor of 8-10). We point out that\nfor the WHIM gas, the kinematic SZE signal can sometimes dominate the thermal\nSZE where the thermal SZE decrement is maximal (150 GHz), and that using the\ncombination of the two increases the chance of WHIM detection using SZE\nsurveys. However, we find no evidence of unique features in the thermal SZE\nangular power spectrum that may aid in its detection. Interestingly, there are\ndifferences in the power spectrum of the kinematic SZE, which may not allow us\nto detect the WHIM directly, but could be an important contaminant in\ncosmological analyses of the kSZE-derived velocity field. Corrections derived\nfrom numerical simulations may be necessary to account for this contamination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2009 20:53:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

Finally we characterize the stochastic processes that are\ngoverned by a single transfer operator.\n  In our applications, the particular stochastic process will live on an\ninfinite path-space which is realized in turn on a state space $S$. In the case\nof random walk on graphs $G$, $S$ will be the set of vertices of $G$. The\nHilbert space $\\mathcal{H}$ on which the transfer operator $T$ acts will then\nbe an $L^{2}$ space on $S$, or a Hilbert space defined from an energy-quadratic\nform.\n  This circle of problems is both interesting and non-trivial as it turns out\nthat $T$ may often be an unbounded linear operator in $\\mathcal{H}$; but even\nif it is bounded, it is a non-normal operator, so its spectral theory is not\namenable to an analysis with the use of von Neumann's spectral theorem. While\nwe offer a number of applications, we believe that our spectral analysis will\nhave intrinsic interest for the theory of operators in Hilbert space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Mar 2009 03:00:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

An essential improvement of Samuels' model was given by Tomkins\n(1990) in his pragmatic-analytical transfer pricing approach, which is a\ncombination of a single cost-plus transfer price and the pragmatic process of\nnegotiation. This fundamental approach was developed under the assumption that\nthe net average revenue curve for the final product is linear.\n  In this paper, Tomkins' pragmatic-analytical model is further developed for\nnon-linear net average revenue curves. In particular, typical quadratic\nfunctions are considered and corresponding transfer price schedules are\ndetermined. A similar technique can be used for the transfer pricing problem\nwith any net average revenue curve.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Mar 2009 15:16:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-20"}

We compare these data to\nsubmillimetre data taken using the SCUBA camera on the JCMT, and far-infrared\ndata taken with the ISOPHOT camera on board the ISO satellite. All of the data\nshow a relation between the position of the peak of emission and the wavelength\nfor the core of L1155. We interpret this as a temperature gradient. We fit\nmodified blackbody curves to the spectral energy distributions at two positions\nin the core and see that the central core in L1155 (L1155C) is approximately 2\ndegrees warmer at one edge than it is in the centre. We consider a number of\npossible heating sources and conclude that the A6V star BD+67 1263 is the most\nlikely candidate. This star is at a distance of 0.7 pc from the front of L1155C\nin the plane of the sky. We carry out radiative transfer modelling of the\nL1155C core including the effects from the nearby star. We find that we can\ngenerate a good fit to the observed data at all wavelengths, and demonstrate\nthat the different morphologies of the core at different wavelengths can be\nexplained by the observed 2 degree temperature gradient. The L1148 core\nexhibits a similar morphology to that of L1155C, and the data are also\nconsistent with a temperature gradient across the core. In this case, the most\nlikely heating source is the star BD197053. Our findings illustrate very\nclearly that the apparent observed morphology of a pre-stellar core can be\nhighly dependent on the wavelength of the observation, and that temperature\ngradients must be taken into account before converting images into column\ndensity distributions. This is important to note when interpreting Akari and\nSpitzer data and will also be significant for Herschel data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Mar 2009 15:27:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}
