Consistent with\nother recent findings, we find that satellite galaxies (SGs) of red, centrally\nconcentrated (elliptical) host galaxies (HGs) with radial velocity separation\n|Delta_V|<600 km/s preferentially reside near the projected major axes of their\nHGs. Among these, this preference is strongest for highly concentrated, red\nSGs. We find that fractional anisotropy increases with decreasing \\Delta_V and\nDelta_R and is nearly 40% greater among the closest SGs (Delta_R<250 kpc/h)\nrelative to more distant (Delta_R>500 kpc/h) SGs. For highly concentrated SGs\nat small (<300 kpc/h) projected separation, we observe a strong radial\n(hostward) alignment signal in isophotal position angles (PAs) due to isophotal\ntwisting and contamination that is not present when using galaxy model PAs.\nAmong objects for which both isophotal and galaxy model PAs agree to <15\ndegrees, this elongation signal is significantly weaker. We also investigate\nthe \"Holmberg Effect,\" a well-known result wherein nearby (<40 kpc/h) SGs of\nlarge, inclined spiral HGs were seen to preferentially reside near the minor\naxes of their HGs. Survey limitations preclude a strict test of this effect\nusing only SDSS spectroscopic galaxies. By adopting a looser set of cuts than\nthose of Holmberg's study, we recover a comparable preference among faint blue\nSGs for the HG minor axis at marginal significance (~3 sigma). We conclude that\nseveral types of alignment likely exist among different galaxy populations, but\nthat the observed nature and strength of alignment trends depend sensitively on\nboth selection criteria and on the method used to determine galaxy orientation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Mar 2009 19:20:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-16"}

We obtain a 100% (94%) detection fraction in the 0.5-2 keV (0.5-10\nkeV) energy band. GPS galaxy X-ray spectra are typically highly obscured. The\nX-ray column density is higher than the HI column density measured in the radio\nby a factor of 10 to 100.

On the other hand, GPS galaxies exhibit a\ncomparable X-ray luminosity to FRII radio galaxies, notwithstanding their much\nhigher radio luminosity. The X-ray to radio luminosity ratio distribution in\nour sample is consistent with the bulk of the high-energy emission being\nproduced by the accretion disk, as well as with dynamical models of GPS\nevolution where X-rays are produced by Compton upscattering of ambient photons.\nFurther support for the former scenario comes from the location of GPS galaxies\nin the X-ray to O[III] luminosity ratio versus column density plane.

This paper, instead, considers the\nmultiplexing benefits of cooperative communications. First, a new\ninterpretation on the fundamental tradeoff between the transmission rate and\noutage probability in multi-antenna relay networks is given. It follows that\nmultiplexing gains can be obtained at any finite SNR, in full-duplex\nmulti-antenna relay networks. Thus relaying can offer not only stronger link\nreliability, but also higher spectral efficiency.\n  Specifically, the decode-and-forward protocol is applied and networks that\nhave one source, one destination, and multiple relays are considered. A receive\npower gain at the relays, which captures the network large scale fading\ncharacteristics, is also considered. It is shown that this power gain can\nsignificantly affect the system diversity-multiplexing tradeoff for any finite\nSNR value. Several relaying protocols are proposed and are shown to offer\nnearly the same outage probability as if the transmit antennas at the source\nand the relay(s) were co-located, given certain SNR and receive power gains at\nthe relays. Thus a higher multiplexing gain than that of the direct link can be\nobtained if the destination has more antennas than the source.\n  Much of the analysis in the paper is valid for arbitrary channel fading\nstatistics. These results point to a view of relay networks as a means for\nproviding higher spectral efficiency, rather than only link reliability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Mar 2009 19:43:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-16"}

We compare the ensemble of high-z observations with large\nsamples of well-observed low-z ellipticals. At the same physical radii, the\nstellar surface mass densities of low and high-z systems are comparable.\nMoreover, the abundance of high surface density material at low redshift is\ncomparable to or larger than that observed at z>1-2, consistent with the\ncontinuous buildup of spheroids over this time. The entire population of\ncompact, high-z red galaxies may be the progenitors of the high-density cores\nof present-day ellipticals, with no need for a decrease in stellar density from\nz=2 to z=0. The primary difference between low and high-z systems is thus the\nobserved low-density material at large radii in low-z spheroids (rather than\nthe high-density material in high-z spheroids). Such low-density material may\neither (1) assemble at z<2 or (2) be present, but not yet detected, at z>2.\nMock observations of low-z massive systems show that the high-z observations do\nnot yet probe sufficiently low surface brightness material to detect the low\nsurface density 'wings' (if present).

We interpret this feature as a hole carved by the energetic winds of\nthe evolving massive stars. The 13-CO hole seen in molecular maps at V_LSR ~95\nkm/s corresponds to near/far kinematic distances of 6.1/8.7+/-1 kpc. We\ncalculate a mean spectrophotometric distance of 7.0^+3.7_-2.4 kpc, broadly\nconsistent with the kinematic distances inferred. This location places it near\nthe northern end of the Galactic bar. For the mean extinction of A_V=12.6+/-0.5\nmag (A_K=1.5+/-0.1 mag), the color-magnitude diagram of probable cluster\nmembers is well fit by isochrones in the age range 18-24 Myr.

MG0414+0534 is\ncharacterized by a bright pair of lensed images (A1, A2) and their optical flux\nratio A2/A1 deviates significantly from the prediction of a smooth lens model.\nQ2237+030 is comprised of four lensed images, which are significantly affected\nby microlensing in a foreground lensing galaxy. Our mid-infrared observations\nof these lensed images have revealed that the mid-infrared flux ratio for A2/A1\nof MG0414+0534 is nearly unity (0.90 +- 0.04). We find that this flux ratio is\nsystematically small, at 4 to 5 sigma level, compared with the prediction of a\nbest smooth lens model (1.09) represented by a singular isothermal ellipsoid\nand external shear, thereby suggesting the presence of substructures to explain\nour observational result. In contrast, for Q2237+030, our high signal-to-noise\nobservation indicates that the mid-infrared flux ratios between all the four\nimages of Q2237+030 are virtually consistent with the prediction of a smooth\nlens model. Based on the size estimate of the dust torus surrounding the nuclei\nof these QSOs, we set limits on the mass of a substructure in these lens\nsystems, which can cause anomalies in the flux ratios. For MG0414+0534, since\nthe required mass of a substructure inside its Einstein radius is > 360 M_sun,\nmillilensing by a CDM substructure is most likely. If it is modeled as a\nsingular isothermal sphere, the mass inside radius of 100 pc is given as >\n1.0x10^5 M_sun. For Q2237+030, there is no significant evidence of\nmillilensing, so the reported anomalous flux ratios in shorter wavelengths are\nentirely caused by microlensing by stars (abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Mar 2009 09:05:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

We derived gravitational mass profiles of 22\nearly-type galaxies observed with XMM-Newton and Chandra. Sixteen galaxies show\nconstant or decreasing radial temperature profiles, and their X-ray\nluminosities are consistent with kinematical energy input from stellar mass\nloss. The temperature profiles of the other 6 galaxies increase with radius,\nand their X-ray luminosities are significantly higher. The integrated\nmass-to-light ratio of each galaxy is constant at that of stars within 0.5-1\nr_e, and increases with radius, where r_e is the effective radius of a galaxy.\nThe scatter of the central mass-to-light ratio of galaxies was less in K-band\nlight. At 3r_e, the integrated mass-to-light ratios of galaxies with flat or\ndecreasing temperature profiles are twice the value at 0.5r_e, where the\nstellar mass dominates, and at 6r_e, these increase to three times the value at\n0.5r_e. This feature should reflect common dark and stellar mass distributions\nin early-type galaxies: Within 3r_e, the mass of dark matter is similar to the\nstellar mass, while within 6r_e, the former is larger than the latter by a\nfactor of two. By contrast, X-ray luminous galaxies have higher gravitational\nmass in the outer regions than X-ray faint galaxies. We describe these X-ray\nluminous galaxies as the central objects of large potential structures; the\npresence or absence of this potential is the main source of the large scatter\nin the X-ray luminosity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Mar 2009 11:45:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2009 10:40:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Rev. Lett. 100, 027205 (2008)]. Here, we report extensive theoretical\ninvestigations of the kinetic and thermodynamic characteristics of several\nco-doped systems including bulk Si and Ge as hosts and various group-III and\ngroup-V e-dopants. The main findings are as follows: The n-p pairing of n-type\ne-dopants with p-type substitutional Mn is energetically stable in bulk Ge and\nSi. Mn atoms move from interstitial sites to substitutional sites easier in the\npresence of a neighboring n-type e-dopant. Magnetic coupling between two Mn\natoms in bulk Ge oscillates between positive (ferromagnetic) and negative\n(antiferromagnetic) values with increasing Mn-Mn distance, but in Mn/As\nco-doped Ge the coupling parameter remains positive at all distances beyond\nnearest-neighbors and this qualitative difference does not change with the\ndoping level. For Mn doped Si, all coupling values except for the nearest\nneighbor one are positive and do not change much upon co-doping. We find an\nunconventional magnetic anisotropy in the co-doped system, that is, the\ndependence of magnetic coupling on the relative positions of the magnetic ions\nand their neighboring e-dopants. We employ Monte Carlo simulations to estimate\nthe Curie temperature (Tc). We find that in Mn doped Ge no ferromagnetic order\nexists for Mn concentrations ranging from 3.13% to 6%. Instead, a spin-glass\nphase transition occurs at ~5K at 5% Mn doping. For Mn/As co-doped Ge, Tc\nincreases nearly linearly with the Mn concentration and reaches 264K at 5% Mn\ndoping.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Mar 2009 12:03:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-04"}
