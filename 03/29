For\nexample, the proton eigenstate has components with L=0 and L=1.

In this paper, we utilize the\n\\emph{global clock} to infuse the so-called \\emph{pending period} to each\noperation in a multiprocessor system, where the pending period is a time\ninterval that contains the performed time of the operation. Further, we define\nthe \\emph{physical time order} for any two operations with disjoint pending\nperiods. The physical time order is obeyed by any real execution in\nmultiprocessor systems due to that it is part of the truly happened operation\norders restricted by global clock, and it is then proven to be independent and\nconsistent with traditional logical time orders. The above novel yet\nfundamental concepts enables new effective approaches for analyzing\nmultiprocessor systems, which are named \\emph{pending period analysis} as a\nwhole. As a consequence of pending period analysis, many important problems of\nmultiprocessor systems can be tackled effectively. As a significant application\nexample, complete memory consistency verification, which was known as an\nNP-hard problem, can be solved with the complexity of $O(n^2)$ (where $n$ is\nthe number of operations). Moreover, the two event ordering problems, which\nwere proven to be Co-NP-Hard and NP-hard respectively, can both be solved with\nthe time complexity of O(n) if restricted by pending period information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Mar 2009 10:34:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 12 Jul 2009 09:10:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-12"}

To pursue the proposition in a systematic way we resort to\nthe rotation curves of spiral galaxies. They have non classical features.\nFirst, we design a spacetime metric around the galaxy to accommodate these\nfeatures. Next we calculate the density and pressure of a hypothetical dark\nmatter that could generate such a spacetime. In the weak field regime and for a\nspherical distribution of mass $M$, we are able to assign a dark perfect gas\ncompanion, whose density is almost proportional to $M^{1/2}$ and fades away\nalmost as $r^{-2}$. However, in view of this orderly relation between the\nobservable mass and its dark companion, one may choose to interpret the whole\nscenario as an alternative theory of gravitation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Mar 2009 21:40:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-31"}

Because of its\ndiscrete nature, when the degree measure was used in analyzing weighted\nnetworks, weights were either ignored or thresholded in order to retain or\ndisregard an edge. Therefore, despite its popularity, the degree measure fails\nto capture the disparity of interaction between a node and its neighbors.\n  We introduce in this paper a generalization of the degree measure that\naddresses this limitation: the continuous node degree (C-degree). The C-degree\nof a node reflects how many neighbors are effectively being used, taking\ninteraction disparity into account. More importantly, if a node interacts\nuniformly with its neighbors (no interaction disparity), we prove that the\nC-degree of the node becomes identical to the node's (discrete) degree. We\nanalyze four real-world weighted networks using the new measure and show that\nthe C-degree distribution follows the power-law, similar to the traditional\ndegree distribution, but with steeper decline. We also show that the ratio\nbetween the C-degree and the (discrete) degree follows a pattern that is common\nin the four studied networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Mar 2009 12:50:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2009 10:00:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2009 13:26:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-15"}

The Debye length of the\nUniverse must be of the order of its size ct.It turns out that it is about 6\ntimes larger. Hence inside the volume of size ct there is an outward electrical\npressure due to the lack of complete screening of the electrical charges.

We provide a novel analysis of what it takes to violate\nBell's inequality within the framework in which both realism and freedom of\nchoice are assumed, by showing that it is impossible to model a violation\nwithout having information in one laboratory about both the setting and the\noutcome at the distant one. While it is possible that outcome information can\nbe revealed from shared hidden variables, the assumed experimenter's freedom to\nchoose the settings forces that setting information must be non-locally\ntransferred, even when the SI condition is obeyed. The sufficient amount of\ntransmitted information about the setting to violate the CHSH inequality up to\nits quantum mechanical maximum is 0.736 bits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Mar 2009 12:57:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2010 16:10:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 31 Aug 2010 10:42:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Until now, these ideas have been transmitted to different\nin part non-commutative and non-Noetherian algebras. Most of these approaches\nrequire an admissible ordering on terms. In this Ph.D.thesis, the concept of\nGroebner bases is generalized to finitely generated monoid and group rings.\nReduction methods are applied to represent monoid and group elements and to\ndescribe the right-ideal congruence in the corresponding monoid and group\nrings, respectively. In general, monoids and especially groups do not offer\nadmissible orderings anymore. Thus, the definition of an appropriate reduction\nrelation is confronted with the following problems: On the one hand, it is\ndifficult to guarantee termination. On the other hand, reduction steps are not\ncompatible with multiplication anymore, so that the reduction relation does not\nnecessarily generate a right-ideal congruence. In this thesis, several\npossibilities of defining reduction relations are presented and evaluated\nw.r.t. the described problems. The concept of saturation (i.e. the extension of\na set of polynomials in such a way that the right-ideal congruence it generates\ncan be captured by reduction) is applied to characterize Groebner bases\nrelatively to the different reductions by s-polynomials. Using these concepts\nand special structural properties, it was possible to define special reduction\nrelations for special classes of monoids (e.g., finite, commutative, or free)\nand for different classes of groups (e.g., finite, free, plain, context-free,\nor nilpotent) and to develop terminating algorithms for computing Groebner\nbases w.r.t. these reduction relations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Mar 2009 13:16:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-31"}

(2009; hereafter D09a) we explore the\nenvironments, optical colours, stellar masses, star formation and AGN activity\nin a sample of 3003 pairs of merging galaxies drawn from the SDSS using visual\nclassifications from the Galaxy Zoo project. While D09a found that the\nspiral-to-elliptical ratio in (major) mergers appeared higher than that of the\nglobal galaxy population, no significant differences are found between the\nenvironmental distributions of mergers and a randomly selected control sample.\nThis makes the high occurrence of spirals in mergers unlikely to be an\nenvironmental effect and must, therefore, arise from differing time-scales of\ndetectability for spirals and ellipticals. We find that merging galaxies have a\nwider spread in colour than the global galaxy population, with a significant\nblue tail resulting from intense star formation in spiral mergers. Galaxies\nclassed as star-forming using their emission-line properties have average\nstar-formation rates approximately doubled by the merger process though star\nformation is negligibly enhanced in merging elliptical galaxies. We conclude\nthat the internal properties of galaxies significantly affect the time-scales\nover which merging systems can be detected (as suggested by recent theoretical\nstudies) which leads to spirals being `over-observed' in mergers.
