We explore here the inclusion of spatial\ncurvature into the growth factor. We expand previous results using the\napproximation $\\Omega_{m}^\\gamma$ and then suggest a new form,\n$f_a=\\Omega_m^\\gamma+(\\gamma-4/7)\\Omega_k$, as an approximation for the growth\nfactor when the curvature $\\Omega_k$ is not negligible, and where the growth\nindex $\\gamma$ is usually model dependent. The expression recovers the standard\nresults for the curved and flat $\\Lambda$CDM and Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati\nmodels. Using the best fit values of $\\Omega_{m0}$ and $\\Omega_{k0}$ to the\nexpansion/distance measurements from Type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic\noscillation, WMAP5, and $H(z)$ data, we fit the growth index parameter to\ncurrent growth factor data and obtain $\\gamma_{\\Lambda}(\\Omega_{k} \\not= 0) =\n0.65^{+0.17}_{-0.15}$ and $\\gamma_{DGP}(\\Omega_{k} \\not= 0) =\n0.53^{+0.14}_{-0.12}$. For the $\\Lambda$CDM model, the 1-$\\sigma$ observational\nbounds are found consistent with theoretical value, unlike the case for the\nDvali-Gabadadze-Porrati model. We also find that the current data we used is\nnot enough to put significant constraints when the 3 parameters in $f_a$ are\nfit simultaneously. Importantly, we find that, in the presence of curvature,\nthe analytical expression proposed for $f_a$ provides a better fit to the\ngrowth factor than other forms and should be useful for future high precision\nmissions and studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2009 01:08:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2009 02:44:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-02"}

We model the interaction among\nmultiple self-interested nodes as a game. It is well-known that the Nash\nequilibria in this game result in zero throughput for all the nodes if they\ntake myopic best-response, thereby leading to a network collapse. This paper\nenables nodes to behave as intelligent entities which can proactively gather\ninformation, form internal conjectures on how their competitors would react to\ntheir actions, and update their beliefs according to their local observations.\nIn this way, nodes are capable to autonomously \"learn\" the behavior of their\ncompetitors, optimize their own actions, and eventually cultivate reciprocity\nin the random access network. To characterize the steady-state outcome, the\nconjectural equilibrium is introduced. Inspired by the biological phenomena of\n\"derivative action\" and \"gradient dynamics\", two distributed conjecture-based\naction update mechanisms are proposed to stabilize the random access network.\nThe sufficient conditions that guarantee the proposed conjecture-based learning\nalgorithms to converge are derived. Moreover, it is shown that all the\nachievable operating points in the throughput region are essentially stable\nconjectural equilibria corresponding to different conjectures. We investigate\nhow the conjectural equilibrium can be selected in heterogeneous networks and\nhow the proposed methods can be extended to ad-hoc networks. Simulations verify\nthat the system performance significantly outperforms existing protocols, such\nas IEEE 802.11 DCF protocol and the PMAC protocol, in terms of throughput,\nfairness, convergence, and stability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Mar 2009 20:42:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2009 23:58:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-09"}

The paper studies\nthe cold condensations in the intermediate-/high-mass proto-cluster IRAS\n05345+3157, focusing the attention on the interaction with the other objects in\nthe cluster. We have performed millimeter high-angular resolution observations,\nboth in the continuum and several molecular lines, with the PdBI and the SMA.\nIn a recent paper, we have already published part of these data. The main\nfinding of that work was the detection of two cold and dense gaseous\ncondensations, called N and S (masses ~2 and ~9 M_sun), characterised by high\nvalues of the deuterium fractionation (~0.1 in both cores). In this paper, we\npresent a full report of the observations, and a complete analysis of the data\nobtained. The millimeter maps reveal the presence of 3 cores inside the\ninterferometers primary beam, called C1-a, C1-b and C2. None of them are\nassociated with cores N and S. C1-b is very likely associated with a newly\nformed early-B ZAMS star embedded inside a hot-core, while C1-a is more likely\nassociated with a class 0 intermediate-mass protostar. The nature of C2 is\nunclear.

The 1D walls are modeled by the error function and the\ntransition from hard to soft walls can be analyzed continuously by varying the\nsoftness parameter $\\sigma$. For $\\sigma\\to 0$ the 1D hard wall limit is\nobtained and the corresponding wall force on the particles is the\n$\\delta$-function. In this limit the interacting particle dynamics agrees with\nprevious results obtained for the 1D hard walls. We show that the two\ninteracting particles in the 1D soft walls model is equivalent to one particle\ninside a soft right triangular billiard. Very small values of $\\sigma$\nsubstantiously change the dynamics inside the billiard and the mean finite-time\nLyapunov exponent decreases significantly as the consequence of regular islands\nwhich appear due to the low-energy double collisions (simultaneous\nparticle-particle-1D wall collisions). The rise of regular islands and sticky\ntrajectories induced by the 1D wall softness is quantified by the number of\noccurrences of the most probable finite-time Lyapunov exponent. On the other\nhand, chaotic motion in the system appears due to the high-energy double\ncollisions. In general we observe that the mean finite-time Lyapunov exponent\ndecreases when $\\sigma$ increases, but the number of occurrences of the most\nprobable finite-time Lyapunov exponent increases, meaning that the phase-space\ndynamics tends to be more ergodiclike. Our results suggest that the transport\nefficiency of interacting particles and heat conduction in periodic structures\nmodeled by billiards will strongly be affected by the smoothness of physically\nrealizable walls.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Mar 2009 20:24:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-03"}

In the typical\nformulation of network interdiction, the task of the interdictor is to find a\nset of edges in a weighted network such that the removal of those edges would\nmaximally increase the cost to an evader of traveling on a path through the\nnetwork.\n  Our work is motivated by cases in which the evader has incomplete information\nabout the network or lacks planning time or computational power, e.g. when\nauthorities set up roadblocks to catch bank robbers, the criminals do not know\nall the roadblock locations or the best path to use for their escape.\n  We introduce a model of network interdiction in which the motion of one or\nmore evaders is described by Markov processes and the evaders are assumed not\nto react to interdiction decisions. The interdiction objective is to find an\nedge set of size B, that maximizes the probability of capturing the evaders.\n  We prove that similar to the standard least-cost formulation for\ndeterministic motion this interdiction problem is also NP-hard. But unlike that\nproblem our interdiction problem is submodular and the optimal solution can be\napproximated within 1-1/e using a greedy algorithm. Additionally, we exploit\nsubmodularity through a priority evaluation strategy that eliminates the linear\ncomplexity scaling in the number of network edges and speeds up the solution by\norders of magnitude. Taken together the results bring closer the goal of\nfinding realistic solutions to the interdiction problem on global-scale\nnetworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Mar 2009 20:10:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-03"}

We compare the HI line widths predicted from\nturbulence driven by supernova (SN) explosions and magneto-rotational\ninstability (MRI) to direct observations in 11 disk galaxies. We use\nhigh-quality maps of the HI mass surface density and line width, obtained by\nthe THINGS survey. We show that all sample galaxies exhibit a systematic radial\ndecline in the HI line width, which appears to be a generic property of HI\ndisks and also implies a radial decline in kinetic energy density of HI. At a\ngalactocentric radius of r25 there is a characteristic value of the HI velocity\ndispersion of $10\\pm2$ \\kms. Inside this radius, galaxies show HI line widths\nabove the thermal value expected from a warm HI component, implying that\nturbulence drivers must be responsible for maintaining this line width.\nTherefore, we compare maps of HI kinetic energy to maps of the star formation\nrate (SFR) and to predictions for energy generated by MRI. We find a positive\ncorrelation between kinetic energy of HI and SFR. For a given turbulence\ndissipation timescale we can estimate the energy input required to maintain the\nobserved kinetic energy. The SN rate implied by the observed recent SFR is\nsufficient to maintain the observed velocity dispersion, if the SN feedback\nefficiency is at least \\epsilon_SN\\simeq0.1. Beyond r25, this efficiency would\nhave to increase to unrealistic values, $\\epsilon>1$, suggesting that\nmechanical energy from young stars does not supply most energy in outer disks.\nOn the other hand, both thermal broadening and turbulence driven by MRI can\nproduce the velocity dispersions and kinetic energies that we observe in this\nregime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Mar 2009 22:07:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

These environment dynamics are often ignored in existing\nmulti-user video transmission solutions. To comply with the decentralized\nnature of wireless networks, we propose to decompose the MUMDP into local MDPs\nusing Lagrangian relaxation. Unlike in conventional multi-user video\ntransmission solutions stemming from the network utility maximization\nframework, the proposed decomposition enables each wireless user to\nindividually solve its own dynamic cross-layer optimization (i.e. the local\nMDP) and the network coordinator to update the Lagrangian multipliers (i.e.\nresource prices) based on not only current, but also future resource needs of\nall users, such that the long-term video quality of all users is maximized.\nHowever, solving the MUMDP requires statistical knowledge of the experienced\nenvironment dynamics, which is often unavailable before transmission time. To\novercome this obstacle, we then propose a novel online learning algorithm,\nwhich allows the wireless users to update their policies in multiple states\nduring one time slot. This is different from conventional learning solutions,\nwhich often update one state per time slot. The proposed learning algorithm can\nsignificantly improve the learning performance, thereby dramatically improving\nthe video quality experienced by the wireless users over time. Our simulation\nresults demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed MUMDP framework as compared\nto conventional multi-user video transmission solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2009 04:49:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-03"}

With numerical simulations of\n100,000 disk particles in a fixed halo potential, we find that in triaxial\nhalos, warps can be excited and sustained just as in spherical or axisymmetric\nhalos but they show some oscillatory behaviors and even can be transformed to a\npolar-ring system if the halo has a prolate-like triaxiality.

Namely, in the thin\nfilm geometry, the hybridized Ru-d$_yz,zx$ orbitals are terminated by top and\nbottom interfaces, resulting in quantum confinement and reduction of N$_o$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2009 08:05:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2009 17:53:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-15"}

To this end we\nobtained multiwavelength observations using the CDS spectrometer aboard SOHO,\nfacilities at the NSO/Sacramento Peak, and the TRACE and RHESSI spacecrafts.\nCDS spectroheliograms in the Fe XIX, Fe XVI, O V and He I lines allows us to\ndetermine the velocity field at different heights/temperatures during the flare\nand to compare them with the chromospheric velocity fields deduced from H alpha\nimage differences. TRACE images in the 17.1 nm band greatly help in determining\nthe morphology and the evolution of the flaring structures. During the\nimpulsive phase a strong blue-shifted Fe XIX component (-200 km/s) is observed\nat the footpoints of the flaring loop system, together with a red-shifted\nemission of O V and He I lines (20 km/s). In one footpoint simultaneous H alpha\ndata are also available and we find, at the same time and location, downflows\nwith an inferred velocity between 4 and 10 km/s. We also verify that the\n\"instantaneous\" momenta of the oppositely directed flows detected in Fe XIX and\nH alpha are equal within one order of magnitude. These signatures are in\ngeneral agreement with the scenario of explosive chromospheric evaporation.\nCombining RHESSI and CDS data after the coronal upflows have ceased, we prove\nthat, independently from the filling factor, an essential contribution to the\ndensity of the post-flare loop system is supplied from evaporated chromospheric\nmaterial. Finally, we consider the cooling of this loop system, that becomes\nsuccessively visible in progressively colder signatures during the gradual\nphase. We show that the observed cooling behaviour can be obtained assuming a\ncoronal filling factor between 0.2 and 0.5.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2009 08:57:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-03"}

We show that the ratio J/M^2 for extremal co-rotating Kerr black\nholes varies from unity at infinite separation to two at the merging limit.\nThese results are interpreted in terms of rotational dragging and compared with\nthe case of counter-rotating Kerr black holes.

As a\nresult of this correlation, we expect massive haloes to be present in larger\nnumber in overdense regions than in underdense ones. Given that a correlation\nexists between a galaxy stellar mass and the hosting dark matter halo mass, the\nsegregation in dark matter halo mass should then result in a segregation in the\ndistribution of stellar mass in the galaxy population. In this work we study\nthe distribution of galaxy stellar mass and rest-frame optical color as a\nfunction of the large-scale galaxy distribution using the VLT VIMOS Deep Survey\nsample, in order to verify the presence of segregation in the properties of the\ngalaxy population. We use the VVDS redshift measurements and multi-band\nphotometric data to derive estimates of the stellar mass, rest-frame optical\ncolor, and of the large-scale galaxy density, on a scale of approximately 8\nMpc, for a sample of 5619 galaxies in the redshift range 0.2<z<1.4. We observe\na significant mass and optical color segregation over the whole redshift\ninterval covered by our sample, such that the median value of the mass\ndistribution is larger and the rest-frame optical color is redder in regions of\nhigh galaxy density. The amplitude of the mass segregation changes little with\nredshift, at least in the high stellar mass regime that we can uniformely\nsample over the 0.2<z<1.4 redshift interval. The color segregation, instead,\ndecreases significantly for z>0.7. However, when we consider only galaxies in\nnarrow bins of stellar mass, in order to exclude the effects of the stellar\nmass segregation on the galaxy properties, we do not observe any more any\nsignificant color segregation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2009 13:05:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Reconnection is the only mechanism by which magnetic fields can\nglobally restructure, enabling them to access a lower energy state. Over the\npast decade, there have been some major advances in our understanding of\nthree-dimensional reconnection. In particular, the key characteristics of 3D\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) reconnection have been determined. For instance, 3D\nreconnection (i) occurs with or without nulls, (ii) occurs continuously and\ncontinually throughout a diffusion region and (iii) is driven by counter\nrotating flows.\n  Furthermore, analysis of resistive 3D MHD magnetic experiments have revealed\nsome intriguing effects relating to where and how reconnection occurs. To\nillustrate these new features, a series of constant-resistivity experiments,\ninvolving the interaction of two opposite-polarity magnetic sources in an\noverlying field, are considered. Such a simple interaction represents a typical\nbuilding block of the Sun's magnetic atmosphere. By following the evolution of\nthe magnetic topology, we are able to explain where, how and at what rate the\nreconnection occurs. Remarkably there can be up to five energy release sites at\nanyone time (compared to one in the potential case) and the duration of the\ninteraction increases (more than doubles) as the resistivity decreases (by a\nfactor of 16). The decreased resistivity also leads to a higher peak ohmic\ndissipation and more energy being released in total, as a result of a greater\ninjection of Poynting flux.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2009 12:59:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Finally, motivated by recent work, we turn\nto the case of motility assay experiments where motors bound to a surface push\non a bundle of filaments.

The stellar continuum confirms\nthe previously reported 3-arm spiral pattern extending into the central 100pc.\nThe stellar kinematics and the gas distribution imply this is a shadowing\neffect due to extinction by gas and dust in the molecular spiral arms. The\nmolecular gas kinematics show a strong residual (i.e. non-circular) velocity,\nwhich is manifested as a 2-arm kinematic spiral. Linear models indicate that\nthis is the line-of-sight velocity pattern expected for a density wave in gas\nthat generates a 3-arm spiral morphology. We estimate the inflow rate along the\narms. Using hydrodynamical models of nuclear spirals, we show that when\nderiving the accretion rate into the central region, outflow in the disk plane\nbetween the arms has to be taken into account. For NGC1097, despite the inflow\nrate along the arms being ~1.2Msun/yr, the net gas accretion rate to the\ncentral few tens of parsecs is much smaller. The numerical models indicate that\nthe inflow rate could be as little as ~0.06Msun/yr. This is sufficient to\ngenerate recurring starbursts, similar in scale to that observed, every\n20-150Myr. The nuclear spiral represents a mechanism that can feed gas into the\ncentral parsecs of the galaxy, with the gas flow sustainable for timescales of\na Gigayear.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2009 15:04:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2009 07:52:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}
