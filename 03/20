In detonation, this part was repelled from the more\nmassive unexploded nucleus remnant, changed the direction of its own motion by\n~10^o and imparted its kinetic energy, in expanding and slowing down, to the\nair in producing an effect of a high-altitude explosion. Because there are no\ntraces of a fall of the more massive remnant, one comes to the conclusion that\non passing through the Earth's atmosphere it again entered a heliocentric orbit\n(the hypothesis of V.Vernadskiy, 1932). A search for this comet,\nP/Tunguska-1908, among the 6077 known NEAs shows the 2005NB56 object to be the\nmost appropriate candidate for a number of its parameters (a size is ~ 170 m, P\n= 2.106 y, e = 0.473 and i = 6.8^o). Back integration of its orbit made without\nallowing for non-gravitational effects suggests that it had passed the Earth on\nJune 27, 1908 at a distance of 0.06945 AU. It is quite possible that a proper\ninclusion of even fairly weak non-gravitational forces would make its orbit fit\nin parameters that of the Tunguska bolide.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Mar 2009 16:15:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-20"}

More remarkably, the\nsolution of a multidimensional Brownian reflected BSDE studied in [11] and [13]\ncan also be represented via a well chosen one-dimensional constrained BSDE with\njumps.This last result is very promising from a numerical point of view for the\nresolution of high dimensional optimal switching problems and more generally\nfor systems of coupled variational inequalities\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Mar 2009 17:29:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 2009 13:32:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2011 07:27:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-10"}

However,\nusing this second point of view, we may more easily, and in fact do, consider\nextensions in two directions, sometimes in conjunction. The first extension is\nto replace $x^{n}$ by more general objects such as the formal variable $\\log\nx$, which appears in the logarithmic formal calculus, and also, more\ninterestingly, by iterated-logarithm expressions. The second extension is to\nreplace the formal translation operator by a more general formal change of\nvariable operator. In addition, we note some of the combinatorics underlying\nthe formal calculus which we treat, and we end by briefly mentioning a\nconnection to Fa\\`a di Bruno's classical formula for the higher derivatives of\na composite function and the classical umbral calculus. Many of these results\nare extracted from more extensive papers \\cite{R1} and \\cite{R2}, to appear.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Mar 2009 18:50:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2009 03:55:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-01"}

AIMS: After\ninvestigating the solar oxygen abundance using a CO5BOLD 3D hydrodynamical\nsolar model in previous work, we undertake a similar approach studying the\nsolar abundance of nitrogen, since this element accounts for a significant\nfraction of the overall solar metallicity, Z. METHOD: We used a selection of\natomic spectral lines to determine the solar nitrogen abundance, relying mainly\non equivalent width measurements in the literature. We investigate the\ninfluence on the abundance analysis, of both deviations from local\nthermodynamic equilibrium (\"NLTE effects\") and photospheric inhomogeneities\n(\"granulation effects\"). RESULTS: We recommend use of a solar nitrogen\nabundance of A(N)=7.86+-0.12 whose error bar reflects the line-to-line scatter.\nCONCLUSION: The solar metallicity implied by the CO5BOLD-based nitrogen and\noxygen abundances is in the range 0.0145<= Z <= 0.0167. This result is a step\ntowards reconciling photospheric abundances with helioseismic constraints on Z.\nOur most suitable estimates are Z=0.0156 and Z/X=0.0213.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Mar 2009 20:00:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Our quantum protocol introduces a mutual authentication procedure,\nuses the quantum Bell states, and applies unitary transformations in the\nauthentication process. Then it exploits and utilizes the entanglement swapping\nand local unitary operations in the communication processes. Thus, after the\nauthentication process, the client users are left alone to communicate with\neach other, and the authenticator has no access to the secrete message.

We used the LLmodels\nstellar model atmosphere code and DDAFIT minimization tool for analysis of\nchemical elements stratification and construction of self-consistent\natmospheric model. Empirical determination of Pr and Nd stratification in the\natmosphere of HD24712 is based on NLTE line formation for Prii/iii and Ndii/iii\nwith the use of the DETAIL code. Based on iterative procedure of stratification\nanalysis and subsequent re-calculation of model atmosphere structure we\nconstructed a self-consistent model of HD24712, i.e. the model which\ntemperature-pressure structure is consistent with results of stratification\nanalysis. It is shown that stratification of chemical elements leads to the\nconsiderable changes in model structure as to compare with non-stratified\nhomogeneous case.

The last generation of hydrostatic 1D LTE MARCS models\npublicly released in 2008 have allowed great achievements in the past years,\nlike the calibration of effective temperature scales. I rapidly describe this\nrelease, and then I discuss in some length the impact of the opacity sampling\napproximation on the thermal structure of models and on their emergent spectra.\nI also insist on limitations inherent to these models. Estimates of collisional\nand radiative time scales for electronic transitions in e.g. TiO suggest that\nnon-LTE effects are important, and should be further investigated. Classical 1D\nmodels are not capable either to provide the large and non-gaussian velocity\nfields we know exist in red supergiants atmospheres. I therefore also present\ncurrent efforts in 3D radiative hydrodynamical simulation of RSGs. I show that\nline profiles and shifts are predicted by these simulations, without the need\nfor fudge micro- and macroturbulence velocities. This is a great progress,\nalthough line depths and widths are slightly too shallow. This is probably\ncaused by the simplified grey radiative transfer used in these heavy\nsimulations. Future non-grey 3D simulations should provide a better fit to\nobservations in terms of line strengths and widths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Mar 2009 10:09:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-23"}

The behavior of bottom in the\nmedium is expected to be largely different from that of charm. Therefore, the\ndetermination of the fraction of bottom in the electrons from heavy flavor is\nnecessary to understand the behavior of heavy quarks in the matter.\n  The first separate measurement of charm and bottom via partial reconstruction\nof $D/\\bar{D} \\to e^{\\pm} K^{\\mp} X$ decay has been carried out in $p+p$\ncollisions.

In this study we performed a self-consistent, empirical\nmodel atmosphere study of the brightest rapidly oscillating Ap star alpha Cir.\nWe account for chemical stratification in the model atmosphere calculations and\nassess the importance of non-uniformed vertical element distribution on the\nmodel structure, energy distribution and hydrogen line profiles.

In order to critically\nexamine the entire oxygen budget, we attempt here initially to estimate the\nabundance of atomic oxygen, O, in the only one region, where molecular oxygen,\nO2, has been detected to date. We analyse ISOCAM-CVF spectral image data toward\nrho Oph A to derive the temperatures and column densities of H2 at the\nlocations of ISO-LWS observations of two [OI] 3P_J lines. The intensity ratios\nof the (J=1-2) 63um to (J=0-1) 145um lines largely exceed ten, attesting to the\nfact that these lines are optically thin. This is confirmed by radiative\ntransfer calculations, making these lines suitable for abundance\ndeterminations. For that purpose, we calculate line strengths and compare them\nto the LWS observations. Excess [OI] emission is observed to be associated with\nthe molecular outflow from VLA 1623. For this region, we determine the physical\nparameters, T and N(H2), from the CAM observations and the gas density, n(H2),\nis determined from the flux ratio of the [O I]63um and [O I]145um lines.

As option (1) disregards valid [O\nI] 145um data, we do not find it very compelling; we favour option (3), as\nlower abundances are expected as a result of chemical cloud evolution, but we\nare not able to dismiss option (2) entirely.

These\noscillations, 2.6 kilometers per second in amplitude, are coupled with\nchromospheric line-of-sight Doppler velocities with an average blue shift of 23\nkilometers per second. A lack of cospatial intensity oscillations and\ntransversal displacements rules out the presence of magneto-acoustic wave\nmodes. The oscillations are a signature of Alfven waves produced by a torsional\ntwist of +/-22 degrees. A phase shift of 180 degrees across the diameter of the\nbright point suggests that these torsional Alfven oscillations are induced\nglobally throughout the entire brightening. The energy flux associated with\nthis wave mode is sufficient to heat the solar corona.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Mar 2009 15:33:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Three\nbases are known. The classic one is given by strings of the fundamental\nparafermionic operators whose sequences of modes are in correspondence with\nrestricted partitions with parts at distance k-1 differing at least by 2.\nAnother basis is expressed in terms of the ordered modes of the k-1 different\nparafermionic fields, which are in correspondence with the so-called multiple\npartitions. Both types of partitions have a natural (Bressoud) path\nrepresentation. Finally, a third basis, formulated in terms of different paths,\nis inherited from the solution of the restricted solid-on-solid model of\nAndrews-Baxter-Forrester. The aim of this work is to review, in a unified and\npedagogical exposition, these four different combinatorial representations of\nthe states of the Z_k parafermionic models.\n  The first part of this article presents the different paths and partitions\nand their bijective relations; it is purely combinatorial, self-contained and\nelementary; it can be read independently of the conformal-field-theory\napplications. The second part links this combinatorial analysis with the bases\nof states of the Z_k parafermionic theories. With the prototypical example of\nthe parafermionic models worked out in detail, this analysis contributes to fix\nsome foundations for the combinatorial study of more complicated theories.\nIndeed, as we briefly indicate in ending, generalized versions of both the\nBressoud and the Andrews-Baxter-Forrester paths emerge naturally in the\ndescription of the minimal models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Mar 2009 15:41:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 May 2009 13:08:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2009 12:54:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

The proper oscillations of astrophysical black holes can be observed in\nthe nearest future with the help of gravitational wave detectors. Quasi-normal\nmodes are also very important in the context of testing of the stability of\nblack objects, the anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT)\ncorrespondence and in higher dimensional theories, such as the brane-world\nscenarios and string theory.\n  This dissertation reviews a number of works, which provide a thorough study\nof the quasi-normal spectrum of a wide class of black holes in four and higher\ndimensions for fields of various spin and gravitational perturbations. We have\nstudied numerically the dependance of the quasi-normal modes on a number of\nfactors, such as the presence of the cosmological constant, the Gauss-Bonnet\nparameter or the aether in the space-time, the dependance of the spectrum on\nparameters of the black hole and fields under consideration. By the analysis of\nthe quasi-normal spectrum, we have studied the stability of higher dimensional\nReissner-Nordstrom-de Sitter black holes, Kaluza-Klein black holes with\nsquashed horizons, Gauss-Bonnet black holes and black strings. Special\nattention is paid to the evolution of massive fields in the background of\nvarious black holes. We have considered their quasi-normal ringing and the\nlate-time tails. In addition, we present two new numerical techniques: a\ngeneralisation of the Nollert improvement of the Frobenius method for higher\ndimensional problems and a qualitatively new method, which allows to calculate\nquasi-normal frequencies for black holes, which metrics are not known\nanalytically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Mar 2009 15:02:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 May 2009 17:27:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-26"}
