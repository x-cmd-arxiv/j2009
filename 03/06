It has long been of interest to calculate the effect on\nbremsstrahlung if the particle is produced inside a finite-size QCD medium such\nas a quark-gluon plasma. For the case of very high-energy particles traveling\nthrough the background of a weakly-coupled quark-gluon plasma, it is known how\nto reduce this problem to an equivalent problem in non-relativistic\ntwo-dimensional quantum mechanics. Analytic solutions, however, have always\nresorted to further approximations. One is a harmonic oscillator approximation\nto the corresponding quantum mechanics problem, which is appropriate for\nsufficiently thick media. Another is to formally treat the particle as having\nonly a single significant scattering from the plasma (known as the N=1 term of\nthe opacity expansion), which is appropriate for sufficiently thin media.

For example, different components might specify\nassignments to different kinds of resource. Often, each component is associated\nwith different sets of soft constraints, and so with different measures of soft\nconstraint violation. The goal is then to minimise a linear combination of such\nmeasures. This paper studies an approach to such problems, which can be thought\nof as multiphase exploitation of multiple objective-/value-restricted\nsubmodels. In this approach, only one computationally difficult component of a\nproblem and the associated subset of objectives is considered at first. This\nproduces partial solutions, which define interesting neighbourhoods in the\nsearch space of the complete problem. Often, it is possible to pick the initial\ncomponent so that variable aggregation can be performed at the first stage, and\nthe neighbourhoods to be explored next are guaranteed to contain feasible\nsolutions. Using integer programming, it is then easy to implement heuristics\nproducing solutions with bounds on their quality.\n  Our study is performed on a university course timetabling problem used in the\n2007 International Timetabling Competition, also known as the Udine Course\nTimetabling Problem. In the proposed heuristic, an objective-restricted\nneighbourhood generator produces assignments of periods to events, with\ndecreasing numbers of violations of two period-related soft constraints. Those\nare relaxed into assignments of events to days, which define neighbourhoods\nthat are easier to search with respect to all four soft constraints.

The\nquantitative predictions of the radiative torque mechanism, which is currently\naccepted as the dominant mechanism of grain alignment, open avenues to tracing\nmagnetic fields in various astrophysical environments, including diffuse and\ndense interstellar gas, molecular clouds, circumstellar environments, accretion\ndisks, comet tails, Zodiacal dust etc. At the same time, measurements of the\nabsolute value of polarization and its variations can, in addition, provide\nunique information about the dust composition and dust environment. In the\nreview I describe the analytical model describing well radiative torques acting\non irregular grains and discuss how the alignment induced by radiative torques\nvaries in the presence of superparamagnetic inclusions and pinwheel torques,\ne.g. arising from the molecular hydrogen formation over grain surface.

Starting from simulated objects representative\nof the near-Earth object population, random realizations of three types of\nsmall-scale topography are added: Gaussian surface fluctuations, craters, and\nboulders. For each, the resulting expected relative errors in the spin and\nobliquity components of the YORP torque are computed. Gaussian power produces\nerrors of order 100% if observations constrain the surface to a spherical\nharmonic order l < 10. A single crater with diameter roughly half the object's\nmean radius, placed at random locations, results in errors of several tens of\npercent. Boulders create torque errors roughly 3 times larger than do craters\nof the same diameter. A single boulder comparable to Yoshinodai on 25143\nItokawa, moved by as little as twice its own diameter, can alter the magnitude\nof the torque by factors of several, and change the sign of its spin component\nat all obliquities. A YORP torque prediction derived from groundbased data can\nbe expected to be in error by of order 100% due to unresolved topography. Small\nsurface changes caused by slow spin-up or spin-down may have significant\nstochastic effects on the spin evolution of small bodies. For rotation periods\nbetween roughly 2 and 10 hours, these unpredictable changes may reverse the\nsign of the YORP torque. Objects in this spin regime may random-walk up and\ndown in spin rate before the rubble-pile limit is exceeded and fissioning or\nloss of surface objects occurs. Similar behavior may be expected at rotation\nrates approaching the limiting values for tensile-strength dominated objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 2009 21:45:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Recent observations from the\nSpitzer Space Telescope enable us to study the mid-infrared dust excess of\nasymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars in the LMC. This is the first time we can\nquantitatively assess the gas and dust input from AGB stars over a complete\ngalaxy, fully based on observations. The integrated mass-loss rate over all\nintermediate and high mass-loss rate carbon-rich AGB candidates in the LMC is\n8.5x10^-3 solar mass per year, up to 2.1x10^-2 solar mass per year. This number\ncould be increased up to 2.7x10^-2 solar mass per year, if oxygen-rich stars\nare included. This is overall consistent with theoretical expectations,\nconsidering the star formation rate when these low- and intermediate-mass stars\nwhere formed, and the initial mass functions. AGB stars are one of the most\nimportant gas sources in the LMC, with supernovae (SNe), which produces about\n2-4x10^-2 solar mass per year. At the moment, the star formation rate exceeds\nthe gas feedback from AGB stars and SNe in the LMC, and the current star\nformation depends on gas already present in the ISM. This suggests that as the\ngas in the ISM is exhausted, the star formation rate will eventually decline in\nthe LMC, unless gas is supplied externally. Our estimates suggest `a missing\ndust-mass problem' in the LMC, which is similarly found in high-z galaxies: the\naccumulated dust mass from AGB stars and possibly SNe over the dust life time\n(400--800 Myrs) is significant less than the dust mass in the ISM.

It follows from an all-order conjecture for the\nanomalous-dimension matrix of n-jet operators in soft-collinear effective\ntheory. We show that the form of this anomalous dimension is severely\nconstrained by soft-collinear factorization, non-abelian exponentiation, and\nthe behavior of amplitudes in collinear limits. Using a diagrammatic analysis,\nwe demonstrate that these constraints imply that to three-loop order the\nanomalous dimension involves only two-parton correlations, with the possible\nexception of a single color structure multiplying a function of conformal cross\nratios depending on the momenta of four external partons, which would have to\nvanish in all two-particle collinear limits. We argue that such a function does\nnot appear at three-loop order, and that the same is true in higher orders. Our\nformula predicts Casimir scaling of the cusp anomalous dimension to all orders\nin perturbation theory, and we explicitly check that the constraints exclude\nthe appearance of higher Casimir invariants at four loops.

The objective\nis to place each tile within a $n$ by $n$ square such that all neighbouring\nedges are labelled with an identical number. Unfortunately, playing Tetravex is\ncomputationally hard. More precisely, we prove that deciding if there is a\ntiling of the Tetravex board is NP-complete. Deciding where to place the tiles\nis therefore NP-hard. This may help to explain why Tetravex is a good puzzle.\nThis result compliments a number of similar results for one person games\ninvolving tiling. For example, NP-completeness results have been shown for: the\noffline version of Tetris, KPlumber (which involves rotating tiles containing\ndrawings of pipes to make a connected network), and shortest sliding puzzle\nproblems. It raises a number of open questions. For example, is the infinite\nversion Turing-complete? How do we generate Tetravex problems which are truly\npuzzling as random NP-complete problems are often surprising easy to solve? Can\nwe observe phase transition behaviour? What about the complexity of the problem\nwhen it is guaranteed to have an unique solution?

The discussion is based on two premises: 1) all human experience is\ngenerated in the brain, 2) the brain has only access to information. Taken\ntogether, these two premises lead us to conclude that all the elements of what\nwe call `reality' are derived mental constructs based on information and\ncompression, i.e., algorithmic models derived from the search for simplicity in\ndata. Naturally, these premises apply to humans in real or virtual environments\nas well as robots or other cognitive systems. Based on this, it is further\nhypothesized that there is a hierarchy of processing levels where simplicity\nand compression play a major role. As applications, I illustrate first the\nrelevance of compression and simplicity in fundamental neuroscience with an\nanalysis of the Mismatch Negativity paradigm. Then I discuss the applicability\nto Presence research, which studies how to produce real-feeling experiences in\nmediated interaction, and use Bayesian modeling to define in a formal way\ndifferent aspects of the illusion of Presence. The idea is put forth that given\nalternative models (interpretations) for a given mediated interaction, a brain\nwill select the simplest one it can construct weighted by prior models. In the\nfinal section the universality of these ideas and applications in robotics,\nmachine learning, biology and education is discussed.

A $b$-dimensional cube is a Cartesian product\n$I_1\\times I_2\\times...\\times I_b$, where each $I_i$ is a closed interval of\nunit length on the real line. The \\emph{cubicity} of $G$, denoted by $\\cub(G)$\nis the minimum positive integer $b$ such that the vertices in $G$ can be mapped\nto axis parallel $b$-dimensional cubes in such a way that two vertices are\nadjacent in $G$ if and only if their assigned cubes intersect. Suppose $S(m)$\ndenotes a star graph on $m+1$ nodes. We define \\emph{claw number} $\\psi(G)$ of\nthe graph to be the largest positive integer $m$ such that $S(m)$ is an induced\nsubgraph of $G$. It can be easily shown that the cubicity of any graph is at\nleast $\\ceil{\\log_2\\psi(G)}$.\n  In this paper, we show that, for an interval graph $G$\n$\\ceil{\\log_2\\psi(G)}\\le\\cub(G)\\le\\ceil{\\log_2\\psi(G)}+2$.

Two strong\ncoupling laser beams and two entangled probe laser beams are used to make two\ndistant BECs be in EIT states and to generate an atom-photon entangled state\nbetween probe lasers and distant BECs. The two BECs are initially in\nun-entangled product coherent states while the probe lasers are initially in an\nentangled state. Entangled states of two distant BECs can be created through\nperforming projective measurements upon the two outgoing probe lasers under\ncertain conditions. Concretely, we propose two protocols to show how to\ngenerate entangled coherent states of the two distant BECs. One is a\nsingle-photon scheme in which an entangled single-photon state serves the\nquantum channel to generate entangled distant BECs. The other is a multiphoton\nscheme where an entangled coherent state of the probe lasers is used as the\nquantum channel. Additionally, we also obtain some atom-photon entangled states\nof particular interest such as entangled states between a pair of optical Bell\n(or quasi-Bell) states and a pair of atomic entangled coherent (or quasi-Bell)\nstates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2009 13:55:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

To reach this goal, we\npresent a first set of nine VVDS galaxies observed with the NIR integral-field\nspectrograph SINFONI on the VLT. Oxygen abundances are derived from empirical\nindicators based on the ratio between strong nebular emission-lines (Halpha,\n[NII]6584 and [SII]6717,6731). Stellar masses are deduced from SED fitting with\nCharlot & Bruzual (2007) population synthesis models, and star formation rates\nare derived from [OII]3727 and Halpha emission-line luminosities. We find a\ntypical shift of 0.2-0.4 dex towards lower metallicities for the z~1.4\ngalaxies, compared to the MZ-relation in the local universe as derived from\nSDSS data. However, this small sample of eight galaxies does not show any clear\ncorrelation between stellar mass and metallicity, unlike other larger samples\nat different redshift (z~0, z~0.7, and z~2). Indeed, our galaxies lie just\nunder the relation at z~2 and show a small trend for more massive galaxies to\nbe more metallic (~0.1 logarithmic slope). There are two possible explanations\nto account for these observations. First, the most massive galaxies present\nhigher specific star formation rates when compared to the global VVDS sample\nwhich could explain the particularly low metallicity of these galaxies as\nalready shown in the SDSS sample. Second, inflow of metal-poor gas due to tidal\ninteractions could also explain the low metallicity of these galaxies as two of\nthese three galaxies show clear signatures of merging in their velocity fields.\nFinally, we find that the metallicity of 4 galaxies is lower by ~0.2 to 0.4 dex\nif we take into account the N/O abundance ratio in their metallicity estimate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2009 13:56:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2009 07:54:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 29 Oct 2009 13:57:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

In this paper we\npresent results of a calculation from first principles of the velocity field on\nthe surface of a star that is perturbed by a binary companion. This allows us\nto follow the orbital phase-dependence of the amount of kinetic energy that may\nbe dissipated through the viscous shear, dot-E, driven by tidal interactions.\nFor stars with relatively small stellar radii compared with the orbital\nseparation at periastron (R/r_per< 0.14), a clear maximum occurs before\nperiastron passage for sub-synchronous rotation and after periastron for\nsuper-synchronous rotation. For larger stellar radii however, dot-E oscillates\nover the orbital cycle and periastron passage does not cause a particularly\ngreater enhancement in energy dissipation rates than some of the other orbital\nphases. Finally, we perform exploratory calculations for a WR/LBV binary system\nthat in 1993-1994 underwent an LBV-like eruption, HD 5980. Our dot-E\ncalculations reproduce the oscillations that appear around periastron passage\nin HD5980's recent visual light curve. We suggest that the energy dissipation\nfrom tidal flows in asynchronously rotating binary stars may provide a\nmechanism by which evolving stars may be driven into an active state. Given the\nnature of the tidal perturbations, the resulting mass-loss distribution is\nexpected to be non-uniform over the stellar surface and highly time-dependent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2009 15:02:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-09"}

A remarkable\nfeature of this result is that it is valid even for unbounded regression\nfunctions and the choice of the temperature parameter depends exclusively on\nthe noise level.

Accepted for\n  publication in ApJ","journal-ref":"Astrophys.J.699:985-989,2009","doi":"10.1088/0004-637X/699/2/985","report-no":null,"categories":"astro-ph.CO","license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","abstract":"  (Abridged)Motivated by the recent results of Hansen et al. (2008) concerning\na noticeable hemispherical power asymmetry in the WMAP data on small angular\nscales, we revisit the dipole modulated signal model introduced by Gordon et\nal. (2005). This model assumes that the true CMB signal consists of a Gaussian\nisotropic random field modulated by a dipole, and is characterized by an\noverall modulation amplitude, A, and a preferred direction, p. Previous\nanalyses of this model has been restricted to very low resolution due to\ncomputational cost. In this paper, we double the angular resolution, and\ncompute the full corresponding posterior distribution for the 5-year WMAP data.\nThe results from our analysis are the following: The best-fit modulation\namplitude for l <= 64 and the ILC data with the WMAP KQ85 sky cut is A=0.072\n+/- 0.022, non-zero at 3.3sigma, and the preferred direction points toward\nGalactic coordinates (l,b) = (224 degree, -22 degree) +/- 24 degree. The\ncorresponding results for l <~ 40 from earlier analyses was A = 0.11 +/- 0.04\nand (l,b) = (225 degree,-27 degree). The statistical significance of a non-zero\namplitude thus increases from 2.8sigma to 3.3sigma when increasing l_max from\n40 to 64, and all results are consistent to within 1sigma. Similarly, the\nBayesian log-evidence difference with respect to the isotropic model increases\nfrom Delta ln E = 1.8 to Delta ln E = 2.6, ranking as \"strong evidence\" on the\nJeffreys' scale. The raw best-fit log-likelihood difference increases from\nDelta ln L = 6.1 to Delta ln L = 7.3. Similar, and often slightly stronger,\nresults are found for other data combinations. Thus, we find that the evidence\nfor a dipole power distribution in the WMAP data increases with l in the 5-year\nWMAP data set, in agreement with the reports of Hansen et al. (2008).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2009 15:37:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2009 13:12:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}
