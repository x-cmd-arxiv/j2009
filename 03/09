Here, we present the quiescent spectra. They\ncontain at least three components. The dominant component is the white dwarf\n(WD), which cools following the superoutburst. The amount of cooling depends\nsomewhat on the WD models used. For log g of 8.0, the temperature drops from\n24,000K just after the outburst to 20,000 K just before the normal outburst.\nFor this model, and a distance of 65 pc, the WD radius is ~8 x 10**8 cm and v\nsin(i) is ~420 km/s. The fact that the derived radius is smaller than expected\nfor a WD with log g=8 suggests a higher gravity WD or that VW Hyi is somewhat\nfurther than 65 pc. Either is possible given the current distance uncertainty\nof +-20 pc. Earlier suggestions that the WD photosphere shows evidence of CNO\nprocessed material are confirmed, but our analysis also shows that issues\nremain in terms of analyzing the spectra of WDs in such unusual physical\nsituations. The second component is relatively featureless and shows modulation\non the orbital (and just after outburst, the superhump) period. It is likely\nassociated with the hot spot where material from the secondary encounters the\ndisk, rather than the boundary layer region between the inner disk and WD.

The $\\Z_2$\n$SFH$ of these solid tori forms a \"categorification of Pascal's triangle\", and\ncontact structures correspond bijectively to chord diagrams, or sets of\ndisjoint properly embedded arcs in the disc. Their contact elements are\ndistinct and form distinguished subsets of $SFH$ of order given by the Narayana\nnumbers. We find natural \"creation and annihilation operators\" which allow us\nto define a QFT-type basis of $SFH$, consisting of contact elements. Sutured\nFloer homology in this case reduces to the combinatorics of chord diagrams. We\nprove that contact elements are in bijective correspondence with comparable\npairs of basis elements with respect to a certain partial order. The algebraic\nand combinatorial structures in this description have intrinsic\ncontact-topological meaning. In particular, the QFT-basis of $SFH$ and its\npartial order have a natural interpretation in pure contact topology, related\nto the contact category of a disc: the partial order enables us to tell when\nthe sutured solid cylinder obtained by \"stacking\" two chord diagrams has a\ntight contact structure. This leads us to extend Honda's notion of contact\ncategory to a \"bounded\" contact category, containing chord diagrams and contact\nstructures which occur within a given contact solid cylinder. We compute this\nbounded contact category in certain cases. Moreover, the decomposition of a\ncontact element into basis elements naturally gives a triple of contact\nstructures on solid cylinders which we regard as a type of \"distinguished\ntriangle\" in the contact category.

Computed by a six-dimensional integral, it is\nwidely useful in the physics of fluids. For a divergence-free field tangent to\nthe boundary of a domain in 3-space, helicity is known to be invariant under\nvolume-preserving diffeomorphisms of the domain that are homotopic to the\nidentity. We give a new construction of helicity for closed $(k+1)$-forms on a\ndomain in $(2k+1)$-space that vanish when pulled back to the boundary of the\ndomain. Our construction expresses helicity in terms of a cohomology class\nrepresented by the form when pulled back to the compactified configuration\nspace of pairs of points in the domain. We show that our definition is\nequivalent to the standard one. We use our construction to give a new formula\nfor computing helicity by a four-dimensional integral. We provide a Biot-Savart\noperator that computes a primitive for such forms; utilizing it, we obtain\nanother formula for helicity. As a main result, we find a general formula for\nhow much the value of helicity changes when the form is pushed forward by a\ndiffeomorphism of the domain; it relies upon understanding the effect of the\ndiffeomorphism on the homology of the domain and the de Rham cohomology class\nrepresented by the form. Our formula allows us to classify the\nhelicity-preserving diffeomorphisms on a given domain, finding new\nhelicity-preserving diffeomorphisms on the two-holed solid torus, and proving\nthat there are no new helicity-preserving diffeomorphisms on the standard solid\ntorus. We conclude by defining helicities for forms on submanifolds of\nEuclidean space. In addition, we provide a detailed exposition of some standard\n`folk' theorems about the cohomology of the boundary of domains in $\\R^{2k+1}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Mar 2009 23:30:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2009 12:46:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 26 Oct 2012 14:07:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

The\nsignificant rms value in power density spectrum implies that the oscillation\ninvolves in the dynamical and non-linear variation of certain region of the\naccretion disk itself. The nature of the energy dependence implies that the\nregion which produces Comptonized hard tail is also responsible for QPOs.\nSimilarly, the occurrences of the QPOs are strongly related to the jet\nformation and the spectral states. These features are the natural consequences\nof the advective disk paradigm that we are advocating. In the mid 90s, some of\nthe present authors first pointed out that the QPOs in all possible types of\nblack holes may be simply due to the oscillations of the CENBOL, the\nCENtrifugal pressure supported BOundary Layer which is formed in the\nsub-Keplerian flows around a black hole. This CENBOL could be axi-symmetric as\nwell as non-axisymteric in nature since its boundary, namely, the centrifugally\ndriven shocks could be axi-symmetric or non-axisymmetric. In addition, we\npointed out that the transition radius where the flow becomes Keplerian to\nsub-Keplerian, as well as the location of the inner sonic point can also\noscillate and produce the QPOs. Since the shock locations are functions of the\nspecific angular momentum ($\\lambda$) and specific energy (${\\cal E}$) of the\nflow, our model naturally predicts that the QPO frequency should vary with\nmass, spin, $\\lambda$ and ${\\cal E}$. The QPO frequencies with specific ratios,\nsuch as, 2:3 must be due to non-axisymmetric effects when the shock switches\nbetween the two-armed and the three-armed spirals.

The strong coupling to the local\ntemperature and the relatively high population of the lower level (the ground\nstate of Mg I) makes this line an ideal candidate for temperature diagnostics\nin the lower chromosphere/temperature minimum region. Linking the temperature\nprobed to an absolute phys- ical height is non trivial because of Non-LTE\nionization. We analyze the Non-LTE effects and find that photo-ionization from\nthe lower energy levels together with cascading collisional recombination\ndominate the ionization balance. Taking properly into account the\nline-blanketing in the UV is essen- tial for obtaining the right\nphotoionization rates. The identification of the main Non-LTE effects in the\nline allows us to construct a quintessential model atom, ideal for\ncomputationally demanding tasks, e.g. full 3D and/or time-dependent radiative\ntransfer. Furthermore we analyze the diagnostic potential to temperature of\nthis line in solar-like atmospheres, by synthesizing the line from a series of\nparametrized atmospheric models.

These\nrearrangements correspond to the creation of resistive layers, crossing the\nwhole specimen approximately orthogonal to the current density direction, due\nto the simultaneous transition of a large number of weak-links or grains. The\npresent work shows that exact solution of the Kirchhoff equations for strongly\nand weakly linked networks of nonlinear resistors, with Josephson junction\ncharacteristics, yield the subsequent formation of resistive layers within the\nsuperconductive matrix as temperature increases. Furthermore, the voltage noise\nobserved at the transition is related to the resistive layer formation process.\nThe noise intensity is estimated from the superposition of voltage drop\nelementary events related to the subsequent resistive layers. At the end of the\ntransition, the layers mix-up, the step amplitude decreases and the resistance\ncurve smoothes. This results in the suppression of noise, as experimentally\nfound.

We show that the\nintegrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect is an excellent discriminator between\nanti-Copernican inhomogeneous models and the standard Copernican models. As a\nreference model, we consider an anti-Copernican inhomogeneous model that\nconsists of two inner negatively curved underdense regions and an outer flat\nEinstein-de Sitter region. We assume that these regions are connected by two\nthin-walls at redshifts z = 0.067 and z=0.45. In the inner two regions, the\nfirst-order ISW effect is dominant and comparable to that in the concordant\nflat-Lambda models. In the outer Einstein-de Sitter region, the first-order ISW\neffect vanishes but the second-order ISW effect plays a dominant role, while\nthe first-order ISW effect is dominant in the flat-Lambda models at moderate\nredshifts. This difference can discrimate the anti-Copernican models from the\nconcordant flat-Lambda model. At high redshits, the second-order ISW effect is\ndominant both in our inhomogeneous model and the concordant model. In the outer\nregion, moreover, the ISW effect due to large-scale density perturbations with\na present matter density contrast much less than 0.37 is negligible, while the\neffect due to small-scale density perturbations (such as clusters of galaxies,\nsuperclusters and voids) with matter density contrast much larger than 0.37\nwould generate anisotropies which are larger than those generated by the ISW\neffect in the concordant model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Mar 2009 12:09:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-29"}

Whereas biologists have proposed models where the shape is\ncontrolled on a molecular level [1], physicists, following Turing [2] and\nd'Arcy Thomson [3], have developed theories where patterns arise spontaneously\n[4]. Here, we propose a volume constraint that restricts the possible shapes of\nleaves. Focusing on palmate leaves, the central observation is that developing\nleaves first grow folded inside a bud, limited by the previous and subsequent\nleaves. We show that growing folded in this small volume controls globally the\nleaf development. This induces a direct relationship between the way it was\nfolded and the final unfolded shape of the leaf. These dependencies can be\napproximated as simple geometrical relationships that we confirm on both folded\nembryonic and unfolded mature leaves. We find that independently of their\nposition in the phylogenetic tree, these relationships work for folded species,\nbut do not work for non-folded species. This steric constraint is a simple way\nto impose a global regulation for the leaf growth. Such steric regulation\nshould be more general and considered as a new simple means of global\nregulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Mar 2009 13:42:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-11"}

The\nmagnetization data obtained by using a SQUID magnetometer show the NPs as a\nsuperparamagnet in terms of anhysteretic curves near room temperature.\nUnoverlaping of the scaled M(H-ext, T)/M-s vs. H-ext, T plots and the dc\nsusceptibility obeying the Curie-Weiss behavior rather than the Curie law at\nhigh temperatures provide evidence that the NPs are interacting\nsuperparamagnetic ensembles. A mean-field correction to the Langevin function L\n([H-ext + alpha M]/k(B)T) worked well for the magnetic ordering of the NPs. By\nmeans of the Langevin fitting, the diameter of the NP was estimated to be lower\nthan 15 nm, depending oil the milling time. The saturation magnetization of NPs\nvaried from 48.5 em/g to 19 emu/g, with the higher value corresponding to a\nlarger particle size. A core-shell structure of the NP was adopted, with the NP\nhaving the core-shell magnetically-effective mass density. This is applicable\nto the variation of the saturation magnetization with particle size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Mar 2009 14:38:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-10"}

These data\nconfirm the low-temperature, metal-poor nature of this source, as indicated by\nprominent metal-hydride bands, alkali lines, and collision-induced H2\nabsorption. The optical and near-infrared spectra of SDSS J1256-0224 are\nsimilar to those of the sdL4 2MASS J16262034+3925190, and we derive a\nclassification of sdL3.5 based on the preliminary scheme of Burgasser, Cruz, &\nKirkpatrick. The kinematics of SDSS J1256-0224 are consistent with membership\nin the Galactic inner halo, with estimated $UVW$ space velocities indicating a\nslightly prograde, eccentric and inclined Galactic orbit (3.5 <~ R <~ 11 kpc;\n|Zmax| = 7.5 kpc). Comparison to synthetic spectra computed with the Phoenix\ncode, including the recent implementation of kinetic condensate formation\n(Drift-Phoenix), indicate Teff ~ 2100-2500 K and [M/H] ~ -1.5 to -1.0 for logg\n~ 5.0-5.5 (cgs), although there are clear discrepancies between model and\nobserved spectra particularly in the red optical region. The stronger\nmetal-oxide bands present in the Drift-Phoenix model spectra, a result of\nphase-non-equilibrium abundances of grain species, appears to contradict prior\nsuggestions that grain formation is inhibited in metal-poor atmospheres;\nconclusive statements on the metallicity dependence of grain formation\nefficiency are as yet premature. In addition, an apparent shift in the\ntemperature scale of L subdwarfs relative to L dwarfs may obviate the need for\nmodified grain chemistry to explain some of the former's unique spectral\ncharacteristics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Mar 2009 14:59:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The model system is a\nrandomly-anisotropic Heisenberg spin system with a small anisotropy-to-exchange\nratio D/J = 3.5. The dc susceptibility, chi(dc)(T), shows a Curie-Weiss-like\ntransition at a temperature T-C/J approximate to 1.5, followed by a\nlow-temperature glassy behavior manifested by cusps in both the\nzero-field-cooled and the field-cooled curves. The ac susceptibility, chi(ac)\n(T, omega), at various frequencies, w, shows that with decreasing temperature,\na non-Arrhenius dispersive peak occurs at T-b(omega), succeeded by another\ndispersionless peak at T-g/J approximate to 1.20 in the in-phase part, chi'(T,\nomega), of chi (T, omega) while the out-of-phase part, chi '' (T, omega), shows\nonly one peak.
