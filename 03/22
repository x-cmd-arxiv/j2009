Given any polynomial, this simple algorithm always converges to a root,\nexcept on a finite set of initial points lying on a circle of a given radius.\n  Specifically, the algorithm we analyze consists of iterating $$z -\n\\frac{f(z)-t_kf(z_0)}{f'(z)}$$ where the $t_k$ form a decreasing sequence of\nreal numbers and $z_0$ is chosen on a circle containing all the roots. We show\nthat the number of iterates required to locate an approximate zero of a\npolynomial $f$ depends only on $\\log|f(z_0)/\\rho_\\zeta|$ (where $\\rho_\\zeta$ is\nthe radius of convergence of the branch of $f^{-1}$ taking $0$ to a root\n$\\zeta$) and the logarithm of the angle between $f(z_0)$ and certain critical\nvalues. Previous complexity results for related algorithms depend linearly on\nthe reciprocals of these angles. Note that the complexity of the algorithm does\nnot depend directly on the degree of $f$, but only on the geometry of the\ncritical values.\n  Furthermore, for any polynomial $f$ with distinct roots, the average number\nof steps required over all starting points taken on a circle containing all the\nroots is bounded by a constant times the average of $\\log(1/\\rho_\\zeta)$. The\naverage of $\\log(1/\\rho_\\zeta)$ over all polynomials $f$ with $d$ roots in the\nunit disk is ${\\mathcal{O}}({d})$. This algorithm readily generalizes to\nfinding all roots of a polynomial (without deflation); doing so increases the\ncomplexity by a factor of at most $d$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Mar 2009 17:26:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Jul 2011 19:07:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 12 Oct 2017 14:14:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-08"}

Although the\nLSO is already well understood for the case where a test-particle is in an\nelliptical orbit around a Schwarzschild black hole (SBH) and for the case of a\ncircular orbit about a Kerr black hole (KBH) of normalised spin, S (|J|/M^2,\nwhere J is the spin angular momentum of the KBH); it is worthwhile to extend\nour knowledge to include elliptical orbits about a KBH. This extension helps to\nlay the foundation for a better understanding of gravitational wave (GW)\nemission. The mathematical developments described in this work sprang from the\nuse of an effective potential (V) derived from the Kerr metric, which\nencapsulates the Lense-Thirring precession. That allowed us to develop a new\nform of analytical expression to calculate the LSO Radius for circular orbits\n(R_LSO) of arbitrary KBH spin.

Using three samples, we analyze\nblue-sequence E/S0s with stellar masses >10^8 Msun, arguing that individual\nobjects may be evolving either up toward the red sequence or down into the blue\nsequence. Blue-sequence E/S0 galaxies become more common with decreasing\nstellar mass, comprising <2% of E/S0s near the \"shutdown mass\" M_s ~ 1-2 x\n10^11 Msun, increasing to >5% near the \"bimodality mass\" M_b ~ 3 x 10^10 Msun,\nand sharply rising to >20-30% below the \"threshold mass\" M_t ~ 4-6 x 10^9 Msun.\nThe strong emergence of blue-sequence E/S0s below M_t coincides with a\npreviously reported global increase in mean atomic gas fractions below M_t for\ngalaxies of all types on both sequences, suggesting that the availability of\ncold gas may be basic to blue-sequence E/S0s' existence. Environmental analysis\nreveals that many sub-M_b blue-sequence E/S0s reside in low to intermediate\ndensity environments. In mass-radius and mass-sigma scaling relations,\nblue-sequence E/S0s are more similar to red-sequence E/S0s than to late-type\ngalaxies, but they represent a transitional class. While some of them,\nespecially in the high-mass range from M_b to M_s, resemble major-merger\nremnants that will likely fade onto the red sequence, most blue-sequence E/S0s\nbelow M_b show signs of disk and/or pseudobulge building, which may be enhanced\nby companion interactions. We argue that sub-M_b blue-sequence E/S0s occupy a\n\"sweet spot\" in stellar mass and concentration, with both abundant gas and\noptimally efficient star formation, which may enable the formation of large\nspiral disks.

Our observations reveal a large and clumpy expanding envelope around\nthe star. The molecular envelope shows a clear asymmetry in $^{12}$CO J=2--1\nemission in the South-West direction. The elongation of the envelope is found\neven more pronounced in the emission of $^{13}$CO J=2--1 and SO J$_{\\rm\nK}$=6$_5$--5$_4$. A small positional velocity gradient across velocity channels\nis seen in these lines, suggesting the presence of a weak bipolar outflow in\nthe envelope of IRC+10420. In the higher resolution $^{12}$CO J=2--1 map, we\nfind that the envelope has two components: (1) an inner shell (shell I) located\nbetween radius of about 1\"-2\"; (2) an outer shell (shell II) located between 3\"\nto 6\" in radius. These shells represent two previous mass-loss episodes from\nIRC+10420. We attempt to derive in self-consistent manner the physical\nconditions inside the envelope by modelling the dust properties, and the\nheating and cooling of molecular gas. We estimate a mass loss rate of $\\sim$9\n10$^{-4}$ M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ for shell I and 7 10$^{-4}$ M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$\nfor shell II. The gas temperature is found to be unusually high in IRC+10420 in\ncomparison with other oxygen-rich envelopes. The elevated gas temperature is\nmainly due to higher heating rate, which results from the large luminosity of\nthe central s tar. We also derive an isotopic ratio $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C = 6.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Mar 2009 10:51:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}
