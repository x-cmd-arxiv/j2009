A\nnon-monotonic shear stress vs. shear rate constitutive relation is presented.\nThis relation derives from a phenomenological model of a shear ratedependent\nviscosity describing structural changes and involves the possibility of\nmultivalued shear rates under a given shear stress. In the case of a\nstress-dependent viscosity, the same model allows one to predict vorticity\nbanding. Predictions of this model under controlled stress are discussed,\nnamely occurrence of a kind of top- and bottom-jumping of the shear rate in\nresponse to stress increasing-decreasing. Applying this model to evaluation of\nthe flow curve of such colloidal systems is performed. Particular emphasis is\nplaced on the adequate computation of the shear rate function in cylindrical\nCouette cells in order to handle the corresponding flow curve which exhibits\nthe well-known shear stress plateau. Indeed, as different fluid phases coexist\nin the flow domain, measured (torque vs. angular velocity) data cannot be\ndirectly converted into rheometric (shear stress vs. shear rate) functions. As\nthe lacking non-local terms in the model prevents the direct determination of\nthe stress-plateau, this value is included as an adjustable parameter. Thus\nmodel predictions satisfactorily match up experimental data of wormlike\nmicellar solutions from the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2009 16:29:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-05"}

The governing equations of the fluid\ndynamics on the microscopic level consist of the Stokes system for a slightly\ncompressible viscous fluid, occupying a crack -- pore space. In turn, this\ndomain is a union of two independent systems of cracks (fissures) and pores. We\nsuppose that the dimensionless size $\\delta$ of pores depends on the\ndimensionless size $\\varepsilon$ of cracks: $\\delta=\\varepsilon^{r}$ with\n$r>1$. The rigorous justification is fulfilled for homogenization procedure as\nthe dimensionless size of the cracks tends to zero, while the solid body is\ngeometrically periodic. As a result, for the long-time process we derive the\nusual Darcy equations of filtration for the liquid in cracks, while the liquid\nin pores is blocked and unmoved. For the short-time processes the homogenized\nsystem consists of acoustic equations, describing a two-velocity continuum with\nthree independent parameters: the liquid velocity in pores, the liquid velocity\nin cracks and the common pressure. The proofs are based on the method of\nreiterated homogenization, suggested by G. Allaire and M.

Furthermore Vela X-1 exhibited several off states where the source became\nundetectable with ISGRI. We interpret flares and off states as being due to the\nstrongly structured wind of the optical companion: when Vela X-1 encounters a\ncavity in the wind with strongly reduced density, the flux drops, thus\npotentially triggering the onset of the propeller effect which inhibits further\naccretion, thus giving rise to the off states. The required drop in density to\ntrigger the propeller effect in Vela X-1 is of the same order as predicted by\ntheoretical papers for the densities in the OB star winds. The same structured\nwind can give rise to the giant flares when Vela X-1 encounters a dense blob in\nthe wind. Further temporal analysis reveals that a short lived QPO with a\nperiod of ~6800 sec is present. The part of the light curve during which the\nQPO is present is very close to the off states and just following a high\nintensity state, thus showing that all these phenomena are related.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2009 19:06:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-30"}

Namely, the images of $\\Omega(G)$\nand $\\Omega(G)^\\tau$ (fixed point set of $\\tau$) under the $T\\times S^1$ moment\nmap on $\\Omega(G)$ are equal. The space $\\Omega(G)^\\tau$ is homotopy equivalent\nto the loop space $\\Omega(G/K)$ of the Riemannian symmetric space $G/K$. We\nprove a stronger form of a result of Bott and Samelson which relates the\ncohomology rings with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ of $\\Omega(G)$ and\n$\\Omega(G/K)$. Namely, the two cohomology rings are isomorphic, by a\ndegree-halving isomorphism (Bott and Samelson had proved that the Betti numbers\nare equal). A version of this theorem involving equivariant cohomology is also\nproved. The proof uses the notion of conjugation space in the sense of\nHausmann, Holm, and Puppe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2009 19:04:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2009 20:26:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-11"}

It is interesting that, during the first few million years,\nthe fields scale down with mass in line with what is needed for magnetospheric\naccretion, yet no such scaling is observed at later ages within the same\neffective temperature range. This scaling is opposite to the trend in rotation,\nwith shorter rotation periods for very young accreting brown dwarfs compared\nwith accreting solar-mass objects (and very low Rossby numbers in all cases).\nWe speculate that in young objects a deeper intrinsic connection may exist\nbetween magnetospheric accretion and magnetic field strength, or that magnetic\nfield generation in brown dwarfs may be less efficient than in stars.

In the subsequent solution, one\nof the LS similarity solutions emerges as the long-time limit, as expected. But\nour solution tells more. In particular, there is a \"growth\" era prior to what\nis usually called \"coarsening\". During \"growth\" the clusters (all of nearly the\nsame size much larger than critical) eventually exhaust the super-saturation\n(the exhaustion of nucleation in the previous era results from only a small\ndecrease in super-saturation). This allows the critical size to catch up to the\nclusters, and the traditional \"coarsening\" begins: Subcritical clusters\ndissolve and fuel the growth of the remaining super-critical clusters. Our\nanalysis tracks the evolution of cluster sizes during growth and coarsening by\ncomplimentary use of asymptotic and numerical methods. We establish\ncharacteristic times and cluster sizes associated with growth and coarsening\nfrom physical parameters and the initial super-saturation. The emerging\ndistribution is discontinuous at the largest cluster size, and our model\nselects the discontinuous LS similarity solution as the long time limit. There\nare strong indications that the smooth similarity solution proposed in the\noriginal LS paper emerges on a, yet longer, late-coarsening time-scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2009 21:02:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

Determining the\ndemographics of planets beyond the snow line of stars of various masses is thus\nessential for testing this model. Microlensing is sensitive to planets that are\ngenerally inaccessible to other methods, and in particular is most sensitive to\ncool planets at or beyond the snow line, including very low-mass (i.e.\nterrestrial) planets. Hence, microlensing is uniquely suited and so essential\nfor a comprehensive study of this region. Microlensing is also sensitive to\nplanets orbiting low-mass stars, free-floating planets, planets in the Galactic\nbulge and disk, and even planets in external galaxies. These planets can also\nprovide critical constraints on models of planet formation. Although\nmicrolensing searches have so far detected only a handful of planets, these\nhave already changed our understanding of planet formation beyond the snow\nline. Next generation microlensing surveys, which would be sensitive to tens of\n\"cold Earths\" in this region, are well advanced in design conception and are\nstarting initial practical implementation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2009 23:23:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-06"}

With the latter in mind, we examine the\ncoupling of the additional fields to point particles. Nonstandard particle\ndegrees of freedom should be introduced in order to write down the most general\ncoupling. The example we study is the $GL(2,C)$ central extension of gravity\ngiven by Chamseddine, which contains two U(1) gauge fields, and a complex\nvierbein matrix, along with the usual spin connections. For the general\ncoupling one should then attach two U(1) charges and a complex momentum vector\nto the particle, along with the spin. The momenta span orbits in a\nfour-dimensional complex vector space, and are classified by $GL(2,C)$\ninvariants and by their little groups. In addition to orbits associated with\nstandard massive and massless particles, a number of novel orbits can be\nidentified.

The model includes shells of matter with densities\nthat are enhanced relative to the surrounding circumstellar medium. The\nchemical model uses an updated reaction network including reactions from the\nRATE06 database and a more detailed anion chemistry. In particular, new\nmechanisms are considered for the formation of CN-, C3N- and C2H-, and for the\nreactions of hydrocarbon anions with atomic nitrogen and with the most abundant\ncations in the circumstellar envelope. New reactions involving H- are included\nwhich result in the production of significant amounts of C2H- and CN- in the\ninner envelope. The calculated radial molecular abundance profiles for the\nhydrocarbons C2H, C4H and C6H and the cyanopolyynes HC3N and HC5N show narrow\npeaks which are in better agreement with observations than previous models.\nThus, the narrow rings observed in molecular microwave emission surrounding\nIRC+10216 are interpreted as arising in regions of the envelope where the gas\nand dust densities are greater than the surrounding circumstellar medium. Our\nmodels show that CN- and C2H- may be detectable in IRC+10216 despite the very\nlow theorised radiative electron attachment rates of their parent neutral\nspecies.

We show that the bispectrum has the maximum\nsignal in the squeezed triangles, similar to the local-type primordial\nbispectrum, as both types generate non-linearities via products of the\nfirst-order terms in position space.

The differences in shape arise from (i) the way the acoustic\noscillations affect the bispectrum, and (ii) the second-order effects not being\nscale-invariant. This implies that the contamination of the primordial\nbispectrum due to the second-order effects (from the products of the\nfirst-order terms) is small.

We prove this conjecture to be true for the subclass of weakly\nreversible systems for which only facets of the invariant manifold are\nassociated with semilocking sets, or siphons. An important application of this\nwork pertains to chemical reaction systems that are complex-balancing. For\nthese systems it is known that within the interior of each invariant manifold\nthere is a unique equilibrium. The Global Attractor Conjecture states that each\nof these equilibria is globally asymptotically stable relative to the interior\nof the invariant manifold in which it lies. Our results pertaining to weakly\nreversible systems imply that this conjecture holds for all complex-balancing\nsystems whose boundary equilibria lie in the relative interior of the boundary\nfacets. As a corollary, we show that the Global Attractor Conjecture holds for\nthose systems for which the associated invariant manifolds are two-dimensional.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 2009 04:23:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2009 18:51:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2009 17:08:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 3 Jul 2009 21:35:57 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 2009 15:39:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-25"}

Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy\n(ARPES) measurements have revealed a gap-like behavior on parts of the Fermi\nsurface, leaving a non-gapped segment known as Fermi arc around the diagonal of\nthe Brillouin zone. Starting from the $t$-$J$ model, in this paper we present a\nmicroscopic approach to investigate physical properties of the pseudogap phase\nin the framework of a novel renormalization scheme called PRM.

Simple arguments show that the location of the\nlength-scale r_c, marking the transition from positive to negative\ncorrelations, is the same for any class of objects as for the full matter\ndistribution, i.e. it is invariant under biasing. This scale is predicted by\nmodels to be at about the same distance of the scale signaling the baryonic\nacoustic oscillation scale r_{bao}.

To investigate the\norigin of these differences we consider in detail the propagation of errors on\nthe sample density into the estimation of the correlation function.

We\nconclude that, in the newest SDSS samples, the large scale behavior of the\ngalaxy correlation function is affected by intrinsic errors andv\nolume-dependent systematic effects which make the detection of correlations to\nbe only an estimate of a lower limit of their amplitude, spatial extension and\nstatistical errors.

We find that Altair's corona with an\nX-ray luminosity of L_X =1.4 x 10^27 erg/s and a very low activity level of log\nL_X/L_bol = -7.4, is located predominantly at low latitude regions. The X-ray\nemission is dominated by cool plasma (1-4 MK) at low density, and elemental\nabundances exhibit a solar-like FIP effect and Ne/O ratio. The X-ray brightness\nvaries by 30 % over the observation, most likely due to rotational modulation\nand minor activity; in contrast, no strong flares or significant amounts of hot\nplasma were detected. The X-ray activity level of Altair is apparently close to\nthe saturation level, which is reduced by roughly four orders of magnitude when\ncompared to late-type stars. With its fast rotation, Altair provides an\ninefficient, but very stable dynamo that mainly operates in convective layers\nbelow its 'cooler' surface areas around the equator.

We evaluate the types of chains that occur based on the\nMAC interactions between different links using realistic propagation and packet\nforwarding models. We discover that the presence of destructive interactions,\ndue to different forms of hidden terminals, does not impact the throughput of\nan isolated chain significantly.

We compute the off-critical statistics of the source\nin the Loewner equation describing the two dimensional interfaces. In these two\ncases we show that ratios of massive by massless partition functions,\nexpressible as ratios of regularised determinants of massive and massless\nLaplacians, are (local) martingales for the massless interfaces. The\noff-critical drifts in the stochastic source of the Loewner equation are\nproportional to the logarithmic derivative of these ratios.
