Identifying the main processes of galaxy assembly at high redshifts\nis still a major issue to understand galaxy formation and evolution at early\nepochs in the history of the Universe. Aims. This work aims to provide a first\ninsight into the dynamics and mass assembly of galaxies at redshifts 1.2<z<1.6,\nthe early epoch just before the sharp decrease of the cosmic star formation\nrate. Methods. We use the near-infrared integral field spectrograph SINFONI on\nthe ESO-VLT under 0.65 seeing to obtain spatially resolved spectroscopy on nine\nemission line galaxies with 1.2<z<1.6 from the VIMOS VLT Deep Survey. We derive\nthe velocity fields and velocity dispersions on kpc scales using the Halpha\nemission line. Results. Out of the nine star-forming galaxies, we find that\ngalaxies distribute in three groups: two galaxies can be well reproduced by a\nrotating disk, three systems can be classified as major mergers and four\ngalaxies show disturbed dynamics and high velocity dispersion. We argue that\nthere is evidence for hierarchical mass assembly from major merger, with most\nmassive galaxies with M>10^11Msun subject to at least one major merger over a 3\nGyr period as well as for continuous accretion feeding strong star formation.\nConclusions. These results point towards a galaxy formation and assembly\nscenario which involves several processes, possibly acting in parallel, with\nmajor mergers and continuous gas accretion playing a major role. Well\ncontrolled samples representative of the bulk of the galaxy population at this\nkey cosmic time are necessary to make further progress.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2009 20:20:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 7 Mar 2009 15:45:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2009 13:28:25 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2009 13:33:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

In paper I of the series we show how to derive excursion set\ntheory from a path integral formulation. This allows us both to derive\nrigorously the absorbing barrier boundary condition, that in the usual\nformulation is just postulated, and to deal analytically with the non-markovian\nnature of the random walk. Such a non-markovian dynamics inevitably enters when\neither the density is smoothed with filters such as the top-hat filter in\ncoordinate space (which is the only filter associated to a well defined halo\nmass) or when one considers non-Gaussian fluctuations. In these cases, beside\n``markovian'' terms, we find ``memory'' terms that reflect the non-markovianity\nof the evolution with the smoothing scale. We develop a general formalism for\nevaluating perturbatively these non-markovian corrections, and in this paper we\nperform explicitly the computation of the halo mass function for gaussian\nfluctuations, to first order in the non-markovian corrections due to the use of\na tophat filter in coordinate space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2009 17:36:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 7 Mar 2009 00:52:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2009 08:29:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

However, N-body\nsimulations show that dark matter halos grow through a mixture of smooth\naccretion, violent encounters and fragmentations, and modeling halo collapse as\nspherical, or even as ellipsoidal, is a significant oversimplification.

A reanalysis of the Swift XRT light curve together\nwith the three detections by Chandra in 2007 reveals a break at about 1.0 Ms\nafter the burst with a slight steepening of the decay slope from alpha = 1.32\nto 1.61.

Both\nlow-mass (~8-11M_sun) and normal (~12-25M_sun) SNe II produce neutron stars,\nwhich have intense neutrino-driven winds in their nascent stages. These winds\nproduce elements such as Sr, Y, and Zr through charged-particle reactions\n(CPR). Such elements are often called the light r-process elements, but are\nconsidered here as products of CPR and not the r-process. The observed absence\nof production of the low-A elements (Na through Zn including Fe) when the true\nr-process elements (Ba and above) are produced requires that only low-mass SNe\nII be the site if the r-process occurs in SNe II. Normal SNe II produce the CPR\nelements in addition to the low-A elements. This results in a two-component\nmodel that is quantitatively successful in explaining the abundances of all\nelements relative to hydrogen for -3<[Fe/H]<-1.5.

The two phenomena\nare clearly related and crystal defects, particularly dislocations, appear to\nbe involved in both. We have studied the effects of annealing and the effects\nof applying large stresses on the elastic properties of solid 4He, using both\nacoustic resonances and direct low-frequency and low-amplitude measurements of\nthe shear modulus. Both annealing and stressing affect the shear modulus, as\nexpected if dislocations are responsible. However, it is the high temperature\nmodulus which is affected; the low temperature behavior is unchanged and\nappears to reflect the intrinsic modulus of solid helium. We interpret this\nbehavior in terms of dislocations which are pinned by isotopic 3He impurities\nat low temperatures and so have no effect on the shear modulus. At higher\ntemperatures they become mobile and weaken the solid. Stressing the crystal at\nlow temperatures appears to introduce new defects or additional pinning sites\nfor the dislocation network but these effects can be reversed by heating the\ncrystal above 500 mK.

Over the last\ndecade, this has moved from an archeological question to a live investigation:\nthere is now a broad picture of the evolution of galaxies in dark matter halos:\ntheir masses, stars, metals and supermassive blackholes. Galaxies have been\nfound and studied in which these formation processes are taking place most\nvigorously, all the way back in cosmic time to when the intergalactic medium\n(IGM) was still largely neutral. However, the details of how and why the\ninterstellar medium (ISM) in distant galaxies cools, is processed, recycled and\nenriched in metals by stars, and fuels active galactic nuclei (AGNs) remain\nuncertain. In particular, the cooling of gas to fuel star formation, and the\nchemistry and physics of the most intensely active regions is hidden from view\nat optical wavelengths, but can be seen and diagnosed at mid- & far-infrared\n(IR) wavelengths. Rest-frame IR observations are important first to identify\nthe most luminous, interesting and important galaxies, secondly to quantify\naccurately their total luminosity, and finally to use spectroscopy to trace the\nconditions in the molecular and atomic gas out of which stars form. In order to\nmap out these processes over the full range of environments and large-scale\nstructures found in the universe - from the densest clusters of galaxies to the\nemptiest voids - we require tools for deep, large area surveys, of millions of\ngalaxies out to z~5, and for detailed follow-up spectroscopy.

SN 2008S exhibited slow\nphotometric evolution and almost no spectral variability during the first nine\nmonths, implying a high density CS medium. The light curve is similar in shape\nto that of SN 1998S and SN 1979C, although significantly fainter at maximum\nlight. Our quasi-bolometric lightcurve extends to 300 days and shows a tail\nphase decay rate consistent with that of ^{56}Co. We propose that this is\nevidence for an explosion and formation of ^{56}Ni (0.0015 +/- 0.0004 M_Sun).\nThe large MIR flux detected shortly after explosion can be explained by a light\necho from pre-exisiting dust. The late NIR flux excess is plausibly due to a\ncombination of warm newly-formed ejecta dust together with shock-heated dust in\nthe CS environment. We reassess the progenitor object detected previously in\nSpitzer archive images, supplementing this discussion with a model of the MIR\nspectral energy distribution. This supports the idea of a dusty, optically\nthick shell around SN 2008S with an inner radius of nearly 90AU and outer\nradius of 450AU, and an inferred heating source of 3000 K and luminosity of L ~\n10^{4.6} L_Sun. The combination of our monitoring data and the evidence from\nthe progenitor analysis leads us to support the scenario of a weak electron\ncapture supernova explosion in a super-AGB progenitor star (of initial mass 6-8\nM_sun) embedded within a thick CS gaseous envelope. We suggest that all of main\nproperties of the electron capture SN phenomenon are observed in SN 2008S and\nfuture observations may allow a definitive answer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2009 20:44:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 Mar 2009 21:16:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 18 May 2009 17:10:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

It is easy to see that sos-convexity is a sufficient\ncondition for convexity of $p(x)$. Moreover, the problem of deciding\nsos-convexity of a polynomial can be cast as the feasibility of a semidefinite\nprogram, which can be solved efficiently.

It is found that after a brief initial stage of flux\nemergence during which the two polarities of the bipolar region become\nseparated and the tubes intersecting the photosphere become vertical,\nsignificant rotational motion sets in within each polarity. The rotational\nmotions of the two polarities are found to twist up the inner field lines of\nthe emerged fields such that they change their orientation into an inverse\nconfiguration (i.e. pointing from the negative polarity to the positive\npolarity over the neutral line). As a result, a flux rope with sigmoid-shaped,\ndipped core fields form in the corona, and the center of the flux rope rises in\nthe corona with increasing velocity as the twisting of the flux rope footpoints\ncontinues. The rotational motion in the two polarities is a result of\npropagation of non-linear torsional Alfv\\'en waves along the flux tube, which\ntransports significant twist from the tube's interior portion towards its\nexpanded coronal portion. This is a basic process whereby twisted flux ropes\nare developed in the corona with increasing twist and magnetic energy, leading\nup to solar eruptions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2009 21:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-15"}

Some pictures are drawn by using the parametric equations we found.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Mar 2009 15:31:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-21"}
