In particular, the early stages of massive star formation remain poorly\nunderstood. Our goal is to produce a large-scale, systematic database of\nmassive pre- and proto-stellar clumps in the Galaxy, to understand how and\nunder what conditions star formation takes place. A well characterized sample\nof star-forming sites will deliver an evolutionary sequence and a mass function\nof high-mass, star-forming clumps. This systematic survey at submm wavelengths\nalso represents a preparatory work for Herschel and ALMA. The APEX telescope is\nideally located to observe the inner Milky Way. The Large APEX Bolometer Camera\n(LABOCA) is a 295-element bolometer array observing at 870 microns, with a beam\nsize of 19\". Taking advantage of its large field of view (11.4') and excellent\nsensitivity, we started an unbiased survey of the Galactic Plane, with a noise\nlevel of 50-70 mJy/beam: the APEX Telescope Large Area Survey of the Galaxy\n(ATLASGAL). As a first step, we covered 95 sq. deg. These data reveal 6000\ncompact sources brighter than 0.25 Jy, as well as extended structures, many of\nthem filamentary. About two thirds of the compact sources have no bright\ninfrared counterpart, and some of them are likely to correspond to the\nprecursors of (high-mass) proto-stars or proto-clusters. Other compact sources\nharbor hot cores, compact HII regions or young embedded clusters. Assuming a\ntypical distance of 5 kpc, most sources are clumps smaller than 1 pc with\nmasses from a few 10 to a few 100 M_sun. In this introductory paper, we show\npreliminary results from these ongoing observations, and discuss the\nperspectives of the survey.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Mar 2009 21:14:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 May 2009 10:08:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

This expansion identifies that\nthe pilot overhead, as well as the spectral efficiency penalty with respect to\na reference system with genie-aided CSI (channel state information) at the\nreceiver, depend on the square root of the normalized Doppler frequency.\nFurthermore, it is shown that the widely-used block fading model is only a\nspecial case of more accurate continuous fading models in terms of the\nachievable pilot-based spectral efficiency, and that the overhead optimization\nfor multiantenna systems is effectively the same as for single-antenna systems\nwith the normalized Doppler frequency multiplied by the number of transmit\nantennas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Mar 2009 00:36:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

The higher\ndimensional gauge theory is chosen to be the one that the Heterotic string\ntheory suggests: (i) it is defined in ten dimensions, (ii) it is based on the\nE(8) x E(8) symmetry group and (iii) it is N=1 globally supersymmetric. The\nsearch of all four-dimensional gauge theories resulting from the aforementioned\ndimensional reduction, is restricted only to models which are potentially\ninteresting from a phenomenological point of view. This requirement constrain\nthese models to come from one of the known Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) in an\nintermediate stage of the spontaneous symmetry breaking. Main result of my\nstudy is that extensions of the Standard Model (SM) which are based on the\nPati-Salam group structure can be obtained in four dimensions. I furthermore\nreview some interesting noncommutative generalizations of the above ideas and\nverify an important conclusion of a previous research work, namely that the\nparticle physics models resulting from this particular dimensional reduction\nare renormalizable. Finally, assuming noncommutative characteristics for the\nfour-dimensional Minkowski space, M^{4}, I examine a particular approach of\nnoncommutative gravity. It turns out that the Ricci curvature tensor receives\nnon-trivial contributions due to the noncommutative structure of the algebra\ndescribing the space, This conclusion suggests a possible fundamental\nconnection between the noncommutative geometry and the theory of gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Mar 2009 11:13:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-15"}

The early-time emission in the $\\gamma$-ray and X-ray\nbands can be explained by a central engine active for at least 250 s, while at\nlate times the X-ray light curve displays a simple power-law decay. In\ncontrast, the observed behaviour in the optical band is complex (from 10$^2$ up\nto 10$^6$ s). We investigate the light curve behaviour in the context of the\nstandard forward/reverse shock model; associating the peak in the optical light\ncurve at $\\sim$450 s with the fireball deceleration time results in a Lorenz\nfactor $\\Gamma \\approx 350$ at this time. In contrast, the shallow optical\ndecay between 450 and 1500 s remains problematic, requiring a reverse shock\ncomponent whose typical frequency is above the optical band at the optical peak\ntime for it to be explained within the standard model. This predicts an\nincreasing flux density for the forward shock component until t $\\sim$ 4\n$\\times$ 10$^6$ s, inconsistent with the observed decay of the optical emission\nfrom t $\\sim$ 10$^4$ s. A highly magnetized fireball is also ruled out due to\nunrealistic microphysic parameters and predicted light curve behaviour that is\nnot observed. We conclude that a long-lived central engine with a finely tuned\nenergy injection rate and a sudden cessation of the injection is required to\ncreate the observed light curves - consistent with the same conditions that are\ninvoked to explain the plateau phase of canonical X-ray light curves of GRBs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Mar 2009 12:40:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
