Earlier work has suggested that large-scale dynamos can reach and\nmaintain equipartition field strengths on a dynamical time scale only if\nmagnetic helicity of the fluctuating field can be shed from the domain through\nopen boundaries. Aims. Our aim is to test this scenario in convection-driven\ndynamos by comparing results for open and closed boundary conditions. Methods.\nThree-dimensional numerical simulations of turbulent compressible convection\nwith shear and rotation are used to study the effects of boundary conditions on\nthe excitation and saturation of large-scale dynamos. Open (vertical-field) and\nclosed (perfect-conductor) boundary conditions are used for the magnetic field.\nThe shear flow is such that the contours of shear are vertical, crossing the\nouter surface, and are thus ideally suited for driving a shear-induced magnetic\nhelicity flux. Results. We find that for given shear and rotation rate, the\ngrowth rate of the magnetic field is larger if open boundary conditions are\nused. The growth rate first increases for small magnetic Reynolds number, Rm,\nbut then levels off at an approximately constant value for intermediate values\nof Rm. For large enough Rm, a small-scale dynamo is excited and the growth rate\nof the field in this regime increases as Rm^(1/2). Regarding the nonlinear\nregime, the saturation level of the energy of the total magnetic field is\nindependent of Rm when open boundaries are used. In the case of perfect\nconductor boundaries, the saturation level first increases as a function of Rm,\nbut then decreases proportional to Rm^(-1) for Rm > 30, indicative of\ncatastrophic quenching. These results suggest that the shear-induced magnetic\nhelicity flux is efficient in alleviating catastrophic quenching when open\nboundaries are used. The horizontally averaged mean field is still weakly\ndecreasing as a function of Rm even for open boundaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2009 20:44:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2011 19:51:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-08"}

While their key-distribution scheme\nuses quantum entanglement, its security only relies on the impossibility of\nsuperluminal signaling, rather than the correctness and completeness of quantum\ntheory.

We use the broad-band data to test whether the most popular\ntheoretical models for gamma-ray burst emission can accommodate the\nobservations for this burst. We first attempt to explain the soft-to-hard\nspectral evolution associated with the delayed onset of a GeV tail with the\nhypothesis that the prompt burst and the high energy tail both originate from a\nsingle process, namely synchrotron emission from internal shocks.\nConsiderations on the compactness of the source imply that the high-energy tail\nshould be produced in a late-emitted shell, characterized by a Lorentz factor\ngreater than the one generating the prompt burst. However, in this hypothesis,\nthe predicted evolution of the synchrotron peak frequency does not agree with\nthe observed soft-to-hard evolution. Given the difficulties of a\nsingle-mechanism hypothesis, we test two alternative double-component\nscenarios. In the first, the prompt burst is explained as synchrotron radiation\nfrom internal shocks, and the high energy emission (up to about 1 s following\nthe trigger) as internal shock synchrotron-self-Compton. In the second\nscenario, in view of its long duration (\\sim 100 s), the high energy tail is\ndecoupled from the prompt burst and has an external shock origin. In this case,\nwe show that a reasonable choice of parameters does indeed exist to accommodate\nthe optical-to-GeV data, provided the Lorentz factor of the shocked shell is\nsufficiently high. Finally, we attempt to explain the chromatic break observed\naround \\sim 1e3 s with a structured jet model.

A general formulation of this approach, that can be\napplied both to the impurity and to the lattice Anderson Hamiltonian, was\ndeveloped in a previous work (arXiv:0903.0139v1 [cond-mat.str-el]). The method\nstarts from the cumulant expansion of the periodic Anderson model (PAM),\nemploying the hybridization as perturbation. The atomic Anderson limit is\nanalytically solved and its sixteen eigenenergies and eigenstates are obtained.\nThis atomic Anderson solution, which we call the (AAS), has all the fundamental\nexcitations that generate the Kondo effect, and in the atomic approach is\nemployed as a seed to generate the approximate solutions for finite U. The\nwidth of the conduction band is reduced to zero in the AAS, and we choose its\nposition so that the Friedel sum rule (FSR) be satisfied, close to the chemical\npotential.\n  We perform a complete study of the density of states of the SIAM in all the\nrelevant range of parameters: the empty dot, the intermediate valence\n(IV-regime),the Kondo and the magnetic regime. In the Kondo regime we obtain a\ndensity of states that characterizes well the structure of the Kondo peak. To\nshown the usefulness of the method we have calculated the conductance of a\nquantum dot, side coupled to a conduction band.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2009 18:37:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-24"}

This approach assumes that the network is infinite and weakly\nconnected, yet furthermore approximates a dynamic cascading process as a static\npercolation event. In this paper we propose a dynamic Markov model formulation\nthat assumes a finite network with arbitrary average nodal degree. We apply it\nto the case where cascades follow a threshold rule, that is, that a node will\nchange state (\"flip\") only if a fraction, exceeding a given threshold, of its\nneighbors has changed state previously. The corresponding state transition\nmatrix, recalculated after each step, records the probability that a node of\ndegree k has i flipped neighbors after j steps in the cascade's evolution. This\ntheoretical model reproduces a number of behaviors observed in simulations but\nnot yet reported in the literature. These include the ability to predict\ncascades in a domain previously predicted to forbid cascades without assuming\nthat the network is locally tree-like, and, due to the dynamic nature of the\nmodel, a \"near death\" behavior in which cascades initially appear about to die\nbut later explode. Cascades in the \"no cascades\" region require a sufficiently\nlarge seed of initially flipped nodes whose size scales with the size of the\nnetwork or else the cascade will die out. Our theory also predicts the well\nknown properties of cascades, for instance that a single node seed can start a\nglobal cascade in the appropriate regime regardless of the (finite) size of the\nnetwork. The theory and simulations developed here are compared with a\nfoundational paper by Watts which used generating function theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2009 21:44:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2009 14:26:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

The source was observed in V, R and i-bands\nusing the Faulkes Telescopes North and South. The light curve is dominated by\nlong-term variations which are correlated (at the > 3 sigma level) with the\nRXTE ASM soft X-ray flux. The variations span one magnitude in all three\nfilters. We find no evidence for periodicities in our light curves, contrary to\na previous short-timescale optical study in which the flux varied on a 9.3-hour\nsinusoidal period by a smaller amplitude. The optical spectral energy\ndistribution is blue and typical of LMXBs in outburst, as is the power law\nindex of the correlation beta = 0.5, where F_{nu,OPT} propto F_X^beta. The\ndiscrete cross-correlation function reveals a peak at an X-ray lag of 2 - 14\ndays, which could be the viscous timescale. However, adopting the least squares\nmethod the strongest correlation is at a lag of 0 +/- 4 days, consistent with\nX-ray reprocessing on the surface of the disc. We therefore constrain the\noptical lag behind X-ray to be between -14 and +4 days. In addition, we use the\noptical - X-ray luminosity diagram for LMXBs as a diagnostic tool to constrain\nthe nature of the compact object in 4U 1957+11, since black hole (BH) and\nneutron star (NS) sources reside in different regions of this diagram. If the\nsystem contains a BH (as is the currently favoured hypothesis), its distance\nmust exceed ~ 20 kpc for the optical and X-ray luminosities to be consistent\nwith other soft state BH systems. For distances < 20 kpc, the data lie in a\nregion of the diagram populated only by NS sources. 4U 1957+11 is unique: it is\neither the only BH LMXB to exist in an apparent persistent soft state, or it is\na NS LMXB which behaves like a black hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2009 22:09:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

This result is yet to be robustly contradicted, or confirmed, by\nmeasurements on other telescopes and spectrographs; it remains crucial to do\nso. It is also important to consider new possible instrumental systematic\neffects which may explain the Keck/HIRES results. Griest et al. (2009,\narXiv:0904.4725v1) recently identified distortions in the echelle order\nwavelength scales of HIRES with typical amplitudes +/-250m/s. Here we\ninvestigate the effect such distortions may have had on the Keck/HIRES varying\nalpha results. We demonstrate that they cause a random effect on da/a from\nabsorber to absorber because the systems are at different redshifts, placing\nthe relevant absorption lines at different positions in different echelle\norders. The typical magnitude of the effect on da/a is ~0.4x10^{-5} per\nabsorber which, compared to the median error on da/a in the sample,\n~1.9x10^{-5}, is relatively small. Consequently, the weighted mean value\nchanges by less than 0.05x10^{-5} if the corrections we calculate are applied.\nNevertheless, we urge caution, particularly for analyses aiming to achieve high\nprecision da/a measurements on individual systems or small samples, that a much\nmore detailed understanding of such intra-order distortions and their\ndependence on observational parameters is important if they are to be avoided\nor modelled reliably.

From an HI study of a complete sample of classical\nlow-power radio galaxies we find that the host galaxies of extended Fanaroff &\nRiley type-I radio sources are generally HI poor (< 10E8 M_sun) and show no\nindications for gas-rich galaxy mergers or ongoing gas-rich interactions. In\ncontrast, the host galaxies of a significant fraction of low-power compact\nradio sources contain enormous discs/rings of HI gas (with sizes up to 190 kpc\nand masses up to 2 x 10E10 M_sun). This segregation in HI mass with radio\nsource size likely indicates that these compact radio sources are either\nconfined by large amounts of gas in the central region, or that their fueling\nis inefficient and different from the fueling process of classical FR-I radio\nsources. To a first order, the overall HI properties of our complete sample\n(detection rate, mass and morphology) appear similar to those of radio-quiet\nearly-type galaxies. If confirmed by better statistics, this would imply that\nlow-power radio-AGN activity may be a short phase that occurs at some point\nduring the lifetime of many early-type galaxies. We discuss how upcoming HI\nsurveys (e.g. with ASKAP and Apertif) are essential for studying in a\nstatistical way the the connection between the presence and morphology of a\nradio-loud AGN and the properties of the cold HI gas associated with its host\ngalaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2009 03:21:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-25"}

In the case of the small cavity\ncorresponding to the rotational period ~ 3 days, all of the simulated planets\nlose all of their gas even in circular orbits.

Results are generalized to the case of\nspinful particles as well to Green functions at different spatial points\n(relevant to the problem of dephasing in Luttinger liquid interferometers). For\ndouble-step distributions, the dephasing rates are oscillatory functions of the\ninteraction strength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2009 07:19:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-25"}

The Australia Telescope low-brightness survey (ATLBS) at 1388\nMHz covers 8.42 sq deg of the sky in an observing mode designed to yield images\nwith exceptional surface brightness sensitivity and low confusion. The ATLBS\nradio images, made with 0.08 mJy/beam rms noise and 50\" beam, detect a total of\n1094 sources with peak flux exceeding 0.4 mJy/beam. The ATLBS source counts\nwere corrected for blending, noise bias, resolution, and primary beam\nattenuation; the normalized differential source counts are consistent with no\nupturn down to 0.6 mJy. The percentage integrated polarization Pi_0 was\ncomputed after corrections for the polarization bias in integrated polarized\nintensity; Pi_0 shows an increasing trend with decreasing flux density.\nSimultaneous visibility measurements made with longer baselines yielded images,\nwith 5\" beam, of compact components in sources detected in the survey. The\nobservations provide a measurement of the complexity and diffuse emission\nassociated with mJy and sub-mJy radio sources. 10% of the ATLBS sources have\nmore than half of their flux density in extended emission and the fractional\nflux in diffuse components does not appear to vary with flux density, although\nthe percentage of sources that have complex structure increases with flux\ndensity.

This\nperiodicity has an elusive and enigmatic character, since it usually appears\nonly near the maxima of solar cycles, and seems to be related with a periodic\nemergence of strong magnetic flux at the solar surface. Therefore, it is\nprobably connected with the tachocline, a thin layer located near the base of\nthe solar convection zone, where strong dynamo magnetic field is stored. We\nstudy the dynamics of Rossby waves in the tachocline in the presence of a\ntoroidal magnetic field and latitudinal differential rotation.

Here we present Gemini North\nALTAIR/NIFS laser-guide star adaptive-optics assisted K-band integral-field\nspectroscopy of W33A and its inner reflection nebula. In our data we make the\nfirst detections of a rotationally-flattened outer envelope and fast bi-polar\njet of a massive YSO at near-infrared wavelengths. The predominant spectral\nfeatures observed are Br-gamma, H_2, and a combination of emission and\nabsorption from CO gas. We perform a 3-D spectro-astrometric analysis of the\nline emission, the first study of its kind. We find that the object's Br-gamma\nemission reveals evidence for a fast bi-polar jet on sub-milliarcsecond scales,\nwhich is aligned with the larger-scale outflow. The hybrid CO features can be\nexplained as a combination of hot CO emission arising in a disk close to the\ncentral star, while cold CO absorption originates in the cooler outer envelope.\nKinematic analysis of these features reveals that both structures are rotating,\nand consistent with being aligned perpendicularly to both the ionised jet and\nthe large-scale outflow. Assuming Keplerian rotation, we find that the\ncircumstellar disk orbits a central mass of >10Msun, while the outer envelope\nencloses a mass of ~15Msun. Our results suggest a scenario of a central star\naccreting material from a circumstellar disk at the centre of a cool extended\nrotating torus, while driving a fast bi-polar wind. These results therefore\nprovide strong supporting evidence for the hypothesis that the formation\nmechanism for high-mass stars is qualitatively similar to that of low-mass\nstars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2009 10:23:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The heavy energetic ions of the Jovian plasma (H+, O+,\nS+, C+) can erode the surface of Europa via ion sputtering (IS), ejecting up to\n1000 H2O molecules per ion. UV Photons impinging the Europa's surface can also\nresult in neutral atom release via photon-stimulated desorption (PSD) and\nchemical change (photolysis). In this work, we study the efficiency of the IS\nand PSD processes for ejecting water molecules, simulating the resulting\nneutral H2O density. We also estimate the contribution to the total neutral\natom release by the Ion Backscattering (IBS) process. Moreover, we estimate the\npossibility of detecting the sputtered high energy atoms, in order to\ndistinguish the action of the IS process from other surface release mechanisms.\nOur main results are: 1) The most significant sputtered-particle flux and the\nlargest contribution to the neutral H2O-density come from the incident S+ ions;\n2) The H2O density produced via PSD is lower than that due to sputtering by\n~1.5 orders of magnitude; 3) In the energy range below 1 keV, the IBS can be\nconsidered negligible for the production of neutrals, whereas in the higher\nenergy range it becomes the dominant neutral emission mechanism; 4) the total\nsputtering rate for Europa is 2.0\\cdot 1027 H2O s-1; 5) the fraction of\nescaping H2O via IS is 22% of the total sputtered population, while the escape\nfraction for H2O produced by PSD is 30% of the total PSD population. Since the\nPSD exosphere is lower than the IS one, the major agent for Europa's surface\nerosion is IS on both the non-illuminated and illuminated side. Lastly, the\nexospheric neutral density, estimated from the Galileo electron density\nmeasurements appears to be higher than that calculated for H2O alone; this\nfavours the scenario of the presence of O2 produced by radiolysis and\nphotolysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2009 11:25:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2010 12:23:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2010 08:28:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Such changes in colour can be correlated\nwith the oxygen vacancy type defects. No significant change in the grain size\nof the irradiated samples, as revealed from the x-ray diffraction (XRD) line\nwidth broadening, has been observed. Increase of surface roughness due to\nsputtering is clearly visible in scanning electron micrographs (SEM) with\nhighest fluence of irradiation. Room temperature Photoluminescence (PL)\nspectrum of the unirradiated sample shows intense ultra-violet (UV) emission (~\n3.27 eV) and less prominent defect level emissions (2-3 eV). The overall\nemission is largely quenched due to initial irradiation fluence. But with\nincreasing fluence UV emission is enhanced along with prominent defect level\nemissions. Remarkably, the resistivity of the irradiated sample with highest\nfluence is reduced by four orders of magnitude compared to that of the\nunirradiated sample. This indicates increase of donor concentration as well as\ntheir mobility due to irradiation.

Three major\nmechanisms are believed to dominate the radiation process: emission from\nneutral hydrogen surrounding the ionized bubbles of first galaxies and/or\nquasars, emission from neutral hydrogen inside minihalos, and absorption of\ndiffuse neutral hydrogen against the cosmic microwave background. In the\npresent work, by simply combining the existing analytic models for the three\nmechanisms, we investigate the contribution of cross-correlation between these\nthree components to the total 21cm angular power spectrum, in the sense that\nneutral hydrogen associated with different radiation processes traces the\nlarge-scale structures of underlying density perturbations. While the overall\n21cm power spectrum remains almost unchanged with the inclusion of the\ncross-correlations, the cross-correlation may play a key role in the\ndetermination of the 21cm power spectrum during the transition of 21cm\nradiation from emission-dominated phase to absorption-dominated phase at\nredshift z~20. A significant suppression in the 21cm angular power spectrum\nduring this transition is anticipated as the result of negative contribution of\nthe cross-correlation between the absorption of diffuse neutral hydrogen and\nthe emission components. Therefore, an accurate prediction of the cosmic 21cm\npower spectrum should take the cross-correlation into account especially at the\ntransition phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2009 12:47:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

In the relativistic treatment there\nexists a limiting configuration, reached when the Wigner-Seitz cell radius\nequals the radius of the nucleus, with a maximum value of the electron Fermi\nenergy $(E_e^F)_{max}$, here expressed analytically in the ultra-relativistic\napproximation. The corrections given by the relativistic Thomas-Fermi-Dirac\nexchange term are also evaluated and shown to be generally small and negligible\nin the relativistic high density regime. The dependence of the relativistic\nelectron Fermi energies by compression for selected nuclei are compared and\ncontrasted to the non-relativistic ones and to the ones obtained in the uniform\napproximation.

The paper summarizes the theory\nunderlying the control algorithm, which stems from the integral representation\nof the scattered pressure, and presents the successive experiments which have\nbeen conducted with it: control of terminal reflections in a duct, control of\nthe noise scattered by a parallelepiped in an anechoic room, estimation of the\nnoise reflections on the walls of a small room.

Facilities\nallowing such an accurate estimation of the scattered noise are suggested for a\nfuture anechoic room where active devices would deal with the wall reflections\nin the 20-100Hz frequency range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2009 15:03:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-25"}

In this paper, we present a reactive tabu\nsearch (RTS) algorithm, a heuristic based combinatorial optimization technique,\nto achieve low-complexity near-maximum likelihood (ML) signal detection in\nlinear vector channels with large dimensions. Two practically important\nlarge-dimension linear vector channels are considered: i) multiple-input\nmultiple-output (MIMO) channels with large number (tens) of transmit and\nreceive antennas, and ii) severely delay-spread MIMO inter-symbol interference\n(ISI) channels with large number (tens to hundreds) of multipath components.\nThese channels are of interest because the former offers the benefit of\nincreased spectral efficiency (several tens of bps/Hz) and the latter offers\nthe benefit of high time-diversity orders. Our simulation results show that,\nwhile algorithms including variants of sphere decoding do not scale well for\nlarge dimensions, the proposed RTS algorithm scales well for signal detection\nin large dimensions while achieving increasingly closer to ML performance for\nincreasing number of dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2009 15:04:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-25"}
