The profiles represent the most\nextensive spectroscopic radial coverage for any dE galaxy, extending to a\nprojected distance of eight half-light radii (8 r_eff = 14'). We achieve this\ncoverage via Keck/DEIMOS multislit spectroscopic observations of 520 and 442\nmember red giant branch stars in NGC 147 and NGC 185, respectively. In contrast\nto previous studies, we find that both dEs have significant internal rotation.\nWe measure a maximum rotational velocity of 17+/-2 km/s for NGC 147 and 15+/-5\nkm/s for NGC 185. The velocity dispersions decrease gently with radius with an\naverage dispersion of 16+/-1 km/s for NGC 147 and 24+/-1 km/s for NGC 185. Both\ndEs have internal metallicity dispersions of 0.5 dex, but show no evidence for\na radial metallicity gradient. We construct two-integral axisymmetric dynamical\nmodels and find that the observed kinematical profiles cannot be explained\nwithout modest amounts of non-baryonic dark matter. We measure central\nmass-to-light ratios of ML_V = 4.2+/-0.6 and ML_V = 4.6+/-0.6 for NGC 147 and\nNGC 185, respectively. Both dE galaxies are consistent with being primarily\nflattened by their rotational motions, although some anisotropic velocity\ndispersion is needed to fully explain their observed shapes. The velocity\nprofiles of all three Local Group dEs (NGC 147, NGC 185 and NGC 205) suggest\nthat rotation is more prevalent in the dE galaxy class than previously assumed,\nbut is often manifest only at several times the effective radius. Since all dEs\noutside the Local Group have been probed to only inside the effective radius,\nthis opens the door for formation mechanisms in which dEs are transformed or\nstripped versions of gas-rich rotating progenitor galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2009 16:17:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 16 Jan 2010 18:53:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

In the\nfirst, we discuss the task of coin tossing, principally in order to highlight\nthe effect different physical theories have on security in a straightforward\nmanner, but, also, to introduce a new protocol for non-relativistic strong coin\ntossing. This protocol matches the security of the best protocol known to date\nwhile using a conceptually different approach to achieve the task.\n  In the second part variable bias coin tossing is introduced. This is a\nvariant of coin tossing in which one party secretly chooses one of two biased\ncoins to toss. It is shown that this can be achieved with unconditional\nsecurity for a specified range of biases, and with cheat-evident security for\nany bias. We also discuss two further protocols which are conjectured to be\nunconditionally secure for any bias.\n  The third section looks at other two-party secure computations for which,\nprior to our work, protocols and no-go theorems were unknown. We introduce a\ngeneral model for such computations, and show that, within this model, a wide\nrange of functions are impossible to compute securely. We give explicit\ncheating attacks for such functions.\n  In the final chapter we discuss the task of expanding a private random\nstring, while dropping the usual assumption that the protocol's user trusts her\ndevices. Instead we assume that all quantum devices are supplied by an\narbitrarily malicious adversary. We give two protocols that we conjecture\nsecurely perform this task.

Relative distances between dIs and larger galaxies of the\ngroup can be computed in 3D since most of them have now fairly accurately known\ndistances. We find that the dI star formation rates do not depend on local\nenvironment, and in particular they do not show any correlation with the\ndistance of the dI to the nearest large galaxy of the group. There is a clear\nmorphology-density relation in the Centaurus A Group, similarly to the Sculptor\nand Local Groups, in the sense that dEs/dSphs tend to be at small distances\nfrom the more massive galaxies of the group, while dIs are on average at larger\ndistances.

Interestingly the transition dwarfs have an average\ndistance to the more massive galaxies which is intermediate between those of\nthe dEs/dSphs and dIs, and which is quite large: 0.54 +- 0.31 Mpc. This large\ndistance poses some difficulty for the most popular scenarios proposed for\ntransforming a dI into a dE/dSph (ram-pressure with tidal stripping or galaxy\nharassment). If the observed transition dwarfs are indeed missing links between\ndIs and dE/dSphs, their relative isolation makes it less likely to have been\nproduced by these mechanisms. We propose that an inhomogeneous IGM containing\nhigher density clumps would be able to ram-pressure stripped the dIs at such\nlarge distances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2009 19:54:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-02"}

However, in infrared-bright composite systems where a starburst\ncoexists with an active galactic nucleus (AGN), it is unclear whether the\nstarburst, the AGN, or both are driving the outflows. The present paper\ndescribes the results from a search for outflows in 35 infrared-faint Seyferts\nwith 10^9.9 < L_IR/L_sun < 10^11, or, equivalently, star formation rates (SFR)\nof ~0.4 -- 9 solar masses per year, to attempt to isolate the source of the\noutflow. We find that the outflow detection rates for the infrared-faint\nSeyfert 1s (6%) and Seyfert 2s (18%) are lower than previously reported for\ninfrared-luminous Seyfert 1s (50%) and Seyfert 2s (45%). The outflow kinematics\nof infrared-faint and infrared-bright Seyfert 2 galaxies resemble those of\nstarburst galaxies, while the outflow velocities in Seyfert 1 galaxies are\nsignificantly larger. Taken together, these results suggest that the AGN does\nnot play a significant role in driving the outflows in most infrared-faint and\ninfrared-bright systems, except the high-velocity outflows seen in Seyfert 1\ngalaxies. Another striking result of this study is the high rate of detection\nof inflows in infrared-faint galaxies (39% of Seyfert 1s, 35% of Seyfert 2s),\nsignificantly larger than in infrared-luminous Seyferts (15%). This inflow may\nbe contributing to the feeding of the AGN in these galaxies, and potentially\nprovides more than enough material to power the observed nuclear activity over\ntypical AGN lifetimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2009 21:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Dec 2009 18:11:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

X-shooter is the first second-generation instrument to become\noperative at the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT). It is a broad-band\nmedium-resolution spectrograph designed with gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow\nspectroscopy as one of its main science drivers.\n  Aims. During the first commissioning night on sky with the instrument fully\nassembled, X-shooter observed the afterglow of GRB 090313 as a demonstration of\nthe instrument's capabilities.\n  Methods. GRB 090313 was observed almost two days after the burst onset, when\nthe object had already faded to R~21.6. Furthermore, the 90% illuminated Moon\nwas just 30 degrees away from the field. In spite of the adverse conditions, we\nobtained a spectrum that, for the first time in GRB research, covers\nsimultaneously the range from 5700 to 23000 Angstroms.\n  Results. The spectrum shows multiple absorption features at a redshift of\n3.3736, the redshift of the GRB. These features are composed of 3 components\nwith different ionisation levels and velocities. Some of the features have\nnever been observed before in a GRB at such a high redshift. Furthermore, we\ndetect two intervening systems at redshifts of 1.8005 and 1.9597.\n  Conclusions. These results demonstrate the potential of X-shooter in the GRB\nfield, as it was capable of observing a GRB down to a magnitude limit that\nwould include 72% of long GRB afterglows 2 hours after the burst onset.

As a result, the magnetic field geometry along the line of sight, and\nin many cases even the location of the rotating material, is poorly\nconstrained. Frequently, interpretations of Faraday rotation observations are\ndependent upon underlying models of the magnetic field being probed (e.g.,\nuniform, turbulent, equipartition).

We used the standard diagnostic diagrams\n[OIII]/Hbeta versus [NII]/Halpha and ([OIII]/Hbeta versus [SII]/Halpha) to\nisolate AGN in the redshift range 0.15<z<0.45 and the diagnostic diagram\n[OIII]/Hbeta versus [OII]/Hbeta to extend the selection to higher redshift\n(0.5<z<0.92). Combining our sample with one drawn from SDSS, we found that the\nbest description of the evolution of type-2 AGN is a luminosity-dependent\ndensity evolution model. Moreover, using the type-1 AGN LF we were able to\nconstrain the fraction of type-2 AGN to the total (type-1 + type-2) AGN\npopulation. We found that the type-2 fraction decreases with luminosity, in\nagreement with the most recent results, and shows signs of a slight increase\nwith redshift. However, the trend with luminosity is visible only after\ncombining the SDSS+zCOSMOS samples. From the COSMOS data points alone, the\ntype-2 fraction seems to be quite constant with luminosity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2009 21:14:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Wall showed that this property is not true\nof signatures on manifolds with boundary and that the difference from\nadditivity could be described as a certain Maslov triple index. Perverse\nsignatures are signatures defined for any stratified pseudomanifold, using the\nintersection homology groups of Goresky and MacPherson. In the case of Witt\nspaces, the middle perverse signature is the same as the Witt signature. This\npaper proves a generalization to perverse signatures of Wall's non-additivity\ntheorem for signatures of manifolds with boundary. Under certain topological\nconditions on the dividing hypersurface,Novikov additivity for perverse\nsignatures may be deduced as a corollary.

In this paper, using the same approach, we concentrate\non a single regime of impact energy, the so-called catastrophic threshold\nusually designated by Q*D, which results in the escape of half of the target's\nmass. Thanks to our recent implementation of a model of fragmentation of porous\nmaterials, we can characterize Q*D for both porous and non-porous targets with\na wide range of diameters. We can then analyze the potential influence of\nporosity on the value of Q*D, and by computing the gravitational phase of the\ncollision in the gravity regime, we can characterize the collisional outcome in\nterms of the fragment size and ejection speed distributions, which are the main\noutcome properties used by collisional models to study the evolutions of the\ndifferent populations of small bodies. We also check the dependency of Q*D on\nthe impact speed of the projectile. In the strength regime, which corresponds\nto target sizes below a few hundreds of meters, we find that porous targets are\nmore difficult to disrupt than non-porous ones. In the gravity regime, the\noutcome is controlled purely by gravity and porosity in the case of porous\ntargets. In the case of non-porous targets, the outcome also depends on\nstrength. We then propose some power-law relationships between Q*D and both\ntarget's size and impact speed that can be used in collisional evolution\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2009 23:57:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

This question has been resolved (at\nleast for $H^1$ data) if $M[u]E[u]\\leq M[Q]E[Q]$, where $M[u]$ and $E[u]$\ndenote the mass and energy of $u$, and $Q$ denotes the ground state solution to\n$-Q+\\Delta Q +|Q|^2Q=0$.

NAND\nflash is currently the most widely used type of flash memory. In a NAND flash\nmemory, every block of cells consists of numerous pages; rewriting even a\nsingle page requires the whole block to be erased and reprogrammed. Block\nerasures determine both the longevity and the efficiency of a flash memory.\nTherefore, when data in a NAND flash memory are reorganized, minimizing the\ntotal number of block erasures required to achieve the desired data movement is\nan important goal. This leads to the flash data movement problem studied in\nthis paper. We show that coding can significantly reduce the number of block\nerasures required for data movement, and present several optimal or nearly\noptimal data-movement algorithms based upon ideas from coding theory and\ncombinatorics. In particular, we show that the sorting-based (non-coding)\nschemes require at least O(nlogn) erasures to move data among n blocks, whereas\ncoding-based schemes require only O(n) erasures. Furthermore, coding-based\nschemes use only one auxiliary block, which is the best possible, and achieve a\ngood balance between the number of erasures in each of the n+1 blocks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2009 09:01:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-23"}

The azimuthal distribution of polarized flux seems to be\nintimately related to the kinematic orientation of galaxies, such that in\nface-on galaxies the lowest level of polarized flux is detected along the\nkinematic major axis.

Here, this effect is investigated for general systems whose dynamics is\ndescribed by a master equation. To carry out a detailed analysis, the limit of\nsmall perturbations in which linear response theory applies is considered.

Interferometers such as the EVLA,\nASKAP, ATA, MeerKAT, and APERTIF will provide a combination of larger field of\nview and increased simultaneous bandwidth, while maintaining good collecting\narea and angular resolution. They will achieve a survey speed 10-50 times\nlarger at 1-2 GHz than the current possibilities, allowing for the first time\noptical-like all-sky extra-galactic surveys at these frequencies.\n  Significant progress will be made in many fields of radio astronomy. In this\nconference we focused on research into the evolution of galaxies over the past\nfew Gyr. In particular, wide-field observations at 1-2 GHz will provide an\nunprecedented panoramic view of the gas properties and star formation in\ngalaxies, embedded in their environment, from z~0.2-0.5 to the present. Within\nthe framework of our current knowledge of the galaxy population at z<0.5, we\ndiscussed: the key science questions that the new telescopes will permit us to\nanswer in combination with complimentary work at other wavelengths; the\nobserving modes and analysis strategies which will allow us to most efficiently\nexploit the data; and the techniques for most effectively coping with the huge\nvolume of survey products, so far unusual for the radio community. Emphasis was\nplaced on the complementarity of the upcoming facilities and on their role in\npaving the way for the technological development and science goals of the\nSquare Kilometre Array.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2009 11:15:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-23"}

We have secured observational data in a complete wavelength range in\norder to pin down the abundances of half a dozen elements in the nebula. The\nabundances are obtained via detailed photoionization modelling taking into\naccount all the observational constraints (including geometry and aperture\neffects) using the pseudo-3D photoionization code Cloudy_3D. The spectral\nenergy distribution of the ionizing radiation is taken from appropriate model\natmospheres. Both stellar components contribute to the ionization: the ``cool''\none provides the bulk of hydrogen ionization, and the ``hot'' one is\nresponsible for the presence of the most highly charged ions, which explains\nwhy previous attempts to model the nebula experienced difficulties. The nebular\nabundances of C, N, O, and Ne are found to be respectively, 1/3.5, 1/4.2, 1/70,\nand 1/11 of the Solar value, with uncertainties of a factor 2. Thus the extreme\nO deficiency of this object is confirmed. The abundances of S and Ar are less\nthan 1/30 of Solar. Standard models of stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis\ncannot explain the abundance pattern observed in the nebula. To obtain an\nextreme oxygen deficiency in a star whose progenitor has an initial mass of\nabout 1 msun requires an additional mixing process, which can be induced by\nstellar rotation and/or by the presence of the close companion. We have\ncomputed a stellar model with initial mass of 1 msun, appropriate metallicity,\nand initial rotation of 100 kms, and find that rotation greatly improves the\nagreement between the predicted and observed abundances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2009 11:34:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Developed to evaluate the\nrisk of hedge funds, the SVaR appears to be applicable to a wide range of\ninvestments. Its principle is to use the fairly short and sparse history of the\nhedge fund returns to identify relevant risk factors among a very broad set of\npossible risk sources. This risk profile is obtained by calibrating a\ncollection of nonlinear single-factor models as opposed to a single\nmulti-factor model. We then use the risk profile and the very long and rich\nhistory of the factors to asses the possible impact of known past crises on the\nfunds, unveiling their hidden risks and so called \"black swans\".\n  In backtests using data of 1060 hedge funds we demonstrate that the SVaR has\nbetter or comparable properties than several common VaR measures - shows less\nVaR exceptions and, perhaps even more importantly, in case of an exception, by\nsmaller amounts.\n  The ultimate test of the StressVaR however, is in its usage as a fund\nallocating tool.

However, the efforts to improve IPSec\nare still under way; one aspect of this improvement is to take Quality of\nService (QoS) requirements into account. QoS is the ability of the network to\nprovide a service at an assured service level while optimizing the global usage\nof network resources. The QoS level that a flow receives depends on a six-bit\nidentifier in the IP header; the so-called Differentiated Services code point\n(DSCP). Basically, Multi-Field classifiers classify a packet by inspecting\nIP/TCP headers, to decide how the packet should be processed. The current IPSec\nstandard does hardly offer any guidance to do this, because the existing IPSec\nESP security protocol hides much of this information in its encrypted payloads,\npreventing network control devices such as routers and switches from utilizing\nthis information in performing classification appropriately. To solve this\nproblem, we propose a QoS-friendly Encapsulated Security Payload (Q-ESP) as a\nnew IPSec security protocol that provides both security and QoS supports.

In the\nprevious paper we presented the sample, the data and the spectral synthesis\nmodelling while in this paper, we carry out a detailed analysis of the\nmodelling results. We find that the star formation histories of ULIRGs are\ncomplex, with at least two epochs of star formation activity and that the\ncharcteristic timescale of the star formation acivity is <100Myr. These results\nare consistent with models that predict an epoch of enhanced star formation\ncoinciding with the first pass of the merging nuclei, along with a further,\nmore intense, episode of star formation occurring as the nuclei finally merge\ntogether. It is also found that the young stellar populations (YSPs) tend to be\nyounger and more reddened in the nuclear regions of the galaxies. This is in\ngood agreement with the merger simulations, which predict that the bulk of the\nstar formation activity in the final stages of mergers will occur in the\nnuclear regions of the merging galaxies. In addition, our results show that\nULIRGs have total stellar masses that are similar to, or smaller than, the\nbreak of the galaxy mass function (m* = 1.4 x 10^{11} Msolar). Finally, we find\nno significant differences between the ages of the YSP in ULIRGs with and\nwithout optically detected Seyfert nuclei, nor between those with warm and cool\nmid- to far-IR colours. While this results do not entirely rule out the idea\nthat cool ULIRGs with HII/LINER spectra evolve into warm ULIRGs with\nSeyfert-like spectra, it is clear that the AGN activity in local Seyfert-like\nULIRGs has not been triggered a substantial period (>=100 Myr) after the major\nmerger-induced starbursts in the nuclear regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2009 15:12:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

For each of these solutions, we compute the spectrum of\nfluctuations using two techniques, known as the algebraic curve approach and\nthe world-sheet approach. If we use the same prescription for adding\nfluctuation frequencies that was used for type IIB string theory in AdS5 x S5,\nthen we find that the world-sheet spectrum gives convergent one-loop\ncorrections but the algebraic curve spectrum gives divergent ones.
