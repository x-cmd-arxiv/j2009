We\nconsider three extensions of this fundamental problem that are motivated by\npractical considerations in real-world, time-critical identification tasks such\nas emergency response. First, we consider the problem where the objects are\npartitioned into groups, and the goal is to identify only the group to which\nthe object belongs. Second, we address the situation where the queries are\npartitioned into groups, and an algorithm may suggest a group of queries to a\nhuman user, who then selects the actual query. Third, we consider the problem\nof query learning in the presence of persistent query noise, and relate it to\ngroup identification. To address these problems we show that a standard\nalgorithm for query learning, known as the splitting algorithm or generalized\nbinary search, may be viewed as a generalization of Shannon-Fano coding. We\nthen extend this result to the group-based settings, leading to new algorithms.\nThe performance of our algorithms is demonstrated on simulated data and on a\ndatabase used by first responders for toxic chemical identification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2009 19:53:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-25"}

Using the Spitzer IRAC and MIPS photometry, we estimate the\ntotal infrared luminosity, L_IR (8--1000 microns), by finding the best fit\ntemplate from several different template libraries. The long wavelength 70 and\n160 micron data allow us to obtain a reliable estimate of L_IR, accurate to\nwithin 0.2 and 0.05 dex, respectively.

The full sample spans a wide range in L_IR, L_IR ~ 10^8-10^14\nL_sun, with a median luminosity of 10^11.4 L_sun. We identify a total of 687\nluminous, 303 ultraluminous, and 31 hyperluminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs,\nULIRGs, and HyLIRGs) over the redshift range 0.01<z<3.5 with a median redshift\nof 0.5.

SN 2008iy showed an unprecedentedly long rise time of\n~400 days, making it the first SN to take significantly longer than 100 days to\nreach peak optical luminosity. The peak absolute magnitude of SN 2008iy was M_r\n~ -19.1 mag, and the total radiated energy over the first ~700 days was ~2 x\n10^50 erg. Spectroscopically, SN 2008iy is very similar to the Type IIn SN\n1988Z at late times, and, like SN 1988Z, it is a luminous X-ray source (both\nsupernovae had an X-ray luminosity L_ X > 10^41 erg/s). The Halpha emission\nprofile of SN 2008iy shows a narrow P Cygni absorption component, implying a\npre-SN wind speed of ~100 km/s. We argue that the luminosity of SN 2008iy is\npowered via the interaction of the SN ejecta with a dense, clumpy circumstellar\nmedium. The ~400 day rise time can be understood if the number density of\nclumps increases with distance over a radius ~1.7 x 10^16 cm from the\nprogenitor. This scenario is possible if the progenitor experienced an episodic\nphase of enhanced mass-loss < 1 century prior to explosion or the progenitor\nwind speed increased during the decades before core collapse. We favour the\nformer scenario, which is reminiscent of the eruptive mass-loss episodes\nobserved for luminous blue variable (LBV) stars. The progenitor wind speed and\nincreased mass-loss rates serve as further evidence that at least some, and\nperhaps all, Type IIn supernovae experience LBV-like eruptions shortly before\ncore collapse.

Quantum algorithms for hidden\nshift problems usually have a slightly different flavor from hidden subgroup\nalgorithms, as they use the Fourier transform to perform a correlation with a\ngiven reference function, instead of sampling from the Fourier spectrum\ndirectly. In this paper we show that hidden shifts can be extracted efficiently\nfrom Boolean functions that are quadratic forms. We also show how to identify\nan unknown quadratic form on n variables using a linear number of queries, in\ncontrast to the classical case were this takes Theta(n^2) many queries to a\nblack box. What is more, we show that our quantum algorithm is robust in the\nsense that it can also infer the shift if the function is close to a quadratic,\nwhere we consider a Boolean function to be close to a quadratic if it has a\nlarge Gowers U_3 norm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2009 21:07:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Most of\nthe spectra we assembled are from the archives of the FUSE satellite, but for\nnine stars wavelength coverage above 1188A was taken from high-resolution IUE\nor echelle HST/STIS spectra. To represent the tenth star at type B0.2 V we used\nthe Copernicus atlas of tau Sco. We made extensive line identifications in the\nregion 949A to 1225A of all atomic features having published oscillator\nstrengths at types B0, B2, and B8. These are provided as a supplementary data\nproduct - hence the term detailed atlas. Our list of found features totals\n2288, 1612, and 2469 lines, respectively. We were able to identify 92%, 98%,\nand 98% of these features with known atomic transitions with varying degrees of\ncertainty in these spectra. The remaining lines do not have published\noscillator strengths. Photospheric lines account for 94%, 87%, and 91%,\nrespectively, of all our iden- tifications, with the remainder being due to\ninterstellar (usually molecular H2) lines. We also discuss the numbers of lines\nwith respect to the distributions of various ions for these three most studied\nspectral subtypes. A table is also given of 167 least blended lines that can be\nused as possible diagnostics of physical conditions in B star atmospheres.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 2009 02:10:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 Jan 2010 01:29:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

Transmitters and receivers are nodes of a small scale\nwireless network and are assumed to be randomly scattered on a disk. The\ntransmit nodes transmit uncorrelated waveforms.

Assuming that\nthe targets are sparsely located in the angle- Doppler space, based on the\nsamples forwarded by the receive nodes the fusion center formulates an\nl1-optimization problem, the solution of which yields target angle and Doppler\ninformation. The proposed approach achieves the superior resolution of MIMO\nradar with far fewer samples than required by other approaches. This implies\npower savings during the communication phase between the receive nodes and the\nfusion center.

Since the\nquasiclassical and isotropic approximations break down close to interfaces, the\nUsadel equations have to be supplemented with boundary conditions for isotropic\nGreen's functions (BCIGF), which are not derivable within the quasiclassical\ndescription. For a long time, the BCIGF were available only for spin-degenerate\ntunnel contacts, which posed a serious limitation on the applicability of the\nUsadel description to modern structures containing ferromagnetic elements. In\nthis article, we close this gap and derive spin-dependent BCIGF for a contact\nencompassing superconducting and ferromagnetic correlations. This finally\njustifies several simplified versions of the spin-dependent BCIGF, which have\nbeen used in the literature so far. In the general case, our BCIGF are valid as\nsoon as the quasiclassical isotropic approximation can be performed. However,\ntheir use require the knowledge of the full scattering matrix of the contact,\nan information usually not available for realistic interfaces. In the case of a\nweakly polarized tunnel interface, the BCIGF can be expressed in terms of a few\nparameters, i.e. the tunnel conductance of the interface and five\nconductance-like parameters accounting for the spin-dependence of the interface\nscattering amplitudes. In the case of a contact with a ferromagnetic insulator,\nit is possible to find explicit BCIGF also for stronger polarizations. The\nBCIGF derived in this article are sufficienly general to describe a variety of\nphysical situations and may serve as a basis for modelling realistic\nnanostructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 2009 08:52:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2011 08:43:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-19"}

One of the main challenges in compressed\nsensing is to find the support of a sparse signal. In the literature, several\nbounds on the scaling law of the number of measurements for successful support\nrecovery have been derived where the main focus is on random Gaussian\nmeasurement matrices. In this paper, we investigate the noisy support recovery\nproblem from an estimation theoretic point of view, where no specific\nassumption is made on the underlying measurement matrix. The linear\nmeasurements are perturbed by additive white Gaussian noise. We define the\noutput of a support estimator to be a set of position values in increasing\norder. We set the error between the true and estimated supports as the\n$\\ell_2$-norm of their difference. On the one hand, this choice allows us to\nuse the machinery behind the $\\ell_2$-norm error metric and on the other hand,\nconverts the support recovery into a more intuitive and geometrical problem.\nFirst, by using the Hammersley-Chapman-Robbins (HCR) bound, we derive a\nfundamental lower bound on the performance of any \\emph{unbiased} estimator of\nthe support set. This lower bound provides us with necessary conditions on the\nnumber of measurements for reliable $\\ell_2$-norm support recovery, which we\nspecifically evaluate for uniform Gaussian measurement matrices. Then, we\nanalyze the maximum likelihood estimator and derive conditions under which the\nHCR bound is achievable. This leads us to the number of measurements for the\noptimum decoder which is sufficient for reliable $\\ell_2$-norm support\nrecovery. Using this framework, we specifically evaluate sufficient conditions\nfor uniform Gaussian measurement matrices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 2009 15:27:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-26"}

We study the effects of\nthe presence of a boundary on dynamical friction by studying analytically the\ninteraction of perturber with uniform rectilinear motion in a uniform\nhomogeneous medium with a reflecting planar boundary. Wake reflection at a\nmedium's boundary may occur at the edges of truncated disks perturbed by\nplanetary or stellar companions as well as in numerical simulations of\nplanet-disk interaction with no-outflow boundary conditions. In this paper, we\nshow that the presence of the boundary modifies the behaviour of dynamical\nfriction significantly. We find that perturbers are invariably pushed away from\nthe boundary and reach a terminal subsonic velocity near Mach 0.37 regardless\nof initial velocity. Dynamical friction may even be reversed for Mach numbers\nless than 0.37 thereby accelerating instead of decelerating the perturber.\nPerturbers moving parallel to the boundary feel additional friction orthogonal\nto the direction of motion that is much stronger than the standard friction\nalong the direction of motion. These results indicate that the common use of\nthe standard Chandrasekhar formula as a short hand estimate of dynamical\nfriction may be inadequate as observed in various numerical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 2009 15:59:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 2010 14:25:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-17"}

The considered model reproduces the\nconventional Brownian motion when the two particles are far apart and induces\nan effective interaction between them, depending on the choice of the spectral\nfunction of the bath. The coupling between the system and the environment\nguarantees the translational invariance of the system in the absence of an\nexternal potential. The entanglement between the particles is measured by the\nlogarithmic negativity, which is shown to monotonically decrease with the\nincrease of the temperature. A range of finite temperatures is found in which\nentanglement is still induced by the reservoir.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 2009 15:56:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-05"}
