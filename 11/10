We fit\nstellar population synthesis models to the SEDs to derive mean redshifts,\nstellar masses, and ages. The z~7 galaxies are best characterized by\nsubstantial ages (>100 Myr) and M/L_V~0.2. The main trend with decreasing\nluminosity is that of bluing of the far-UV slope from beta~-2.0 to beta~-3.0.\nThis can be explained by decreasing metallicity, except for the lowest\nluminosity galaxies (0.1 L*{z=3}), where low metallicity and smooth SFHs fail\nto match the blue far-UV and moderately red H-[3.6] color.

In the literature of Information Theory, this configuration\nis known as the diamond channel. In this setup, four transmission modes are\npresent, namely: 1) S transmits, and R1 and R2 listen (broadcast mode), 2) S\ntransmits, R1 listens, and simultaneously, R2 transmits and D listens. 3) S\ntransmits, R2 listens, and simultaneously, R1 transmits and D listens. 4) R1,\nR2 transmit, and D listens (multiple-access mode). Assuming a constant power\nconstraint for all transmitters, a parameter $\\Delta$ is defined, which\ncaptures some important features of the channel. It is proven that for\n$\\Delta$=0 the capacity of the channel can be attained by successive relaying,\ni.e, using modes 2 and 3 defined above in a successive manner. This strategy\nmay have an infinite gap from the capacity of the channel when $\\Delta\\neq$0.\nTo achieve rates as close as 0.71 bits to the capacity, it is shown that the\ncases of $\\Delta$>0 and $\\Delta$<0 should be treated differently.

Despite the fact this settles the LU-LC conjecture, a\nsufficient condition for stabilizer states that violate the LU-LC conjecture is\nmissing. In this paper, we investigate further the properties of stabilizer\nstates with respect to local equivalence. Our first result shows that there\nexist infinitely many stabilizer states which violate the LU-LC conjecture. In\nparticular, we show that for all numbers of qubits $n\\geq 28$, there exist\ndistance two stabilizer states which are counterexamples to the LU-LC\nconjecture. We prove that for all odd $n\\geq 195$, there exist stabilizer\nstates with distance greater than two which are LU equivalent but not LC\nequivalent. Two important classes of stabilizer states that are of great\ninterest in quantum computation are the cluster states and stabilizer states of\nthe surface codes. To date, the status of these states with respect to the\nLU-LC conjecture was not studied. We show that, under some minimal\nrestrictions, both these classes of states preclude any counterexamples. In\nthis context, we also show that the associated surface codes do not have any\nencoded non-Clifford transversal gates. We characterize the CSS surface code\nstates in terms of a class of minor closed binary matroids. In addition to\nmaking connection with an important open problem in binary matroid theory, this\ncharacterization does in some cases provide an efficient test for CSS states\nthat are not counterexamples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2009 18:18:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Apr 2010 17:06:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-30"}

The analysis of\ntheir synchrotron spectra showed that the source components have steep spectral\nindices, suggesting that no supply/re-acceleration of fresh particles is\ncurrently taking place in any region of the source. By assuming the\nequipartition magnetic field of 4 mG, we found that only electrons with\n$\\gamma$ < 600, are still contributing to the radio spectrum, while electrons\nwith higher energies have been almost completed depleted. The source radiative\nlifetime we derived is 2700+/-600 years. Considering the best fit to the\noverall spectrum, we find that the time in which the nucleus has not been\nactive represents almost 20% of the whole source lifetime, indicating that the\nsource was 2150+/-500 years old when the radio emission switched off.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2009 16:48:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Three important and non-linear\nelectrostatic effects induced by these interfaces are taken into account:\nsurface charge induced electrostatic field, solvation energies due to the ionic\ncloud, and image charge repulsion. Our variational equations thus go beyond the\nmean-field theory. The influence of salt concentration, ion valency, dielectric\njumps, and surface charge is studied in two geometries. i) A single neutral\nair-water interface with an asymmetric electrolyte. A charge separation and\nthus an electrostatic field gets established due to the different image charge\nrepulsions for coions and counterions. Both charge distributions and surface\ntension are computed and compared to previous approximate calculations. For\nsymmetric electrolyte solutions close to a charged surface, two zones are\ncharacterized.

For small surface charge, the\ncounterion partition coefficient decreases with increasing pore size up to a\ncritical pore size, contrary to neutral membranes.

Icy dust grains play an important role in the formation of complex\ninter- and circumstellar molecules. Observational studies show that polycyclic\naromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are abundantly present in the ISM in the gas\nphase. It is likely that these non-volatile species freeze out onto dust grains\nas well and participate in the astrochemical solid-state network, but\nexperimental PAH ice studies are largely lacking. Methods. Near UV/VIS\nspectroscopy is used to track the in situ VUV driven photochemistry of pyrene\ncontaining ices at temperatures ranging from 10 to 125 K. Results. The main\nphotoproducts of VUV photolyzed pyrene ices are spectroscopically identified\nand their band positions are listed for two host ices, \\water and CO. Pyrene\nionisation is found to be most efficient in \\water ices at low temperatures.\nThe reaction products, triplet pyrene and the 1-hydro-1-pyrenyl radical are\nmost efficiently formed in higher temperature water ices and in low temperature\nCO ice. Formation routes and band strength information of the identified\nspecies are discussed. Additionally, the oscillator strengths of Py, Py^+ and\nPyH are derived and a quantitative kinetic analysis is performed by fitting a\nchemical reaction network to the experimental data. Conclusions. Pyrene is\nefficiently ionised in water ice at temperatures below 50 K. Hydrogenation\nreactions dominate the chemistry in low temperature CO ice with trace amounts\nof water. The results are put in an astrophysical context by determining the\nimportance of PAH ionisation in a molecular cloud. The photoprocessing of a\nsample PAH in ice described in this manuscript indicates that PAH\nphotoprocessing in the solid state should also be taken into account in\nastrochemical models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2009 19:08:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Precise observations of orbital\nmotion near candidate black holes have the potential to determine if they have\nthe spacetime structure that general relativity demands. As a means of\nformulating measurements to test the black hole nature of these objects,\nCollins and Hughes introduced \"bumpy black holes\": objects that are almost, but\nnot quite, general relativity's black holes. The spacetimes of these objects\nhave multipoles that deviate slightly from the black hole solution, reducing to\nblack holes when the deviation is zero. In this paper, we extend this work in\ntwo ways. First, we show how to introduce bumps which are smoother and lead to\nbetter behaved orbits than those in the original presentation. Second, we show\nhow to make bumpy Kerr black holes -- objects which reduce to the Kerr solution\nwhen the deviation goes to zero. This greatly extends the astrophysical\napplicability of bumpy black holes. Using Hamilton-Jacobi techniques, we show\nhow a spacetime's bumps are imprinted on orbital frequencies, and thus can be\ndetermined by measurements which coherently track a small orbiting body's\norbital phase. We find that weak-field orbits of bumpy black holes are modified\nexactly as expected from a Newtonian analysis of a body with a prescribed\nmultipolar structure, reproducing well-known results from the celestial\nmechanics literature. The impact of bumps on strong-field orbits is especially\nstrong, suggesting that this framework will allow observations to set robust\nlimits on the extent to which a spacetime's multipoles deviate from the black\nhole expectation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2009 19:44:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2009 19:24:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-06"}

Kleinberg and Tardos\nproved a sharp algorithmic characterization of such outcomes, but left open the\nproblem of how the actual bargaining process converges to them. A partial\nanswer was provided by Azar et al. who proposed a distributed algorithm for\nconstructing Nash bargaining solutions, but without polynomial bounds on its\nconvergence rate. In this paper, we introduce a simple and natural model for\nthis process, and study its convergence rate to Nash bargaining solutions. At\neach time step, each player proposes a deal to each of her neighbors. The\nproposal consists of a share of the potential profit in case of agreement. The\nshare is chosen to be balanced in Nash's sense as far as this is feasible (with\nrespect to the current best alternatives for both players). We prove that,\nwhenever the Nash bargaining solution is unique (and satisfies a positive gap\ncondition) this dynamics converges to it in polynomial time.

Posing the expression for the marginal likelihood as a Lebesgue\nintegral, we may convert the harmonic mean approximation from a sample\nstatistic to a quadrature rule. As a quadrature, the harmonic mean\napproximation suffers from enormous truncation error as consequence . In\naddition, I demonstrate that the integral expression for the harmonic-mean\napproximation converges slowly at best for high-dimensional problems with\nuninformative prior distributions. These observations lead to two\ncomputationally-modest families of quadrature algorithms that use the full\ngenerality sample posterior but without the instability.

The second algorithm uses the posterior sample to assign\nprobability to a partition of the sample space and performs the marginal\nlikelihood integral directly. This eliminates convergence issues.

We make use of the optical photometry of this OA obtained by the\n0.5 m telescope of AI AS CR, supplemented by the data obtained by other\nobservers, and the X-ray Swift/XRT data.\n  The optical emission peaked at ~ 17.5 mag (R) at t-T0 ~ 500 s.

The goal of this study is to assess the extent to which metal-poor\nstars in the halo reflect the star formation conditions that occurred in halo\nprogenitor galaxies at high redshift, before and during the epoch of\nreionization. Simple prescriptions that translate dark-matter halo mass into\nbaryonic gas budgets and star formation histories yield models that resemble\nthe observed Milky Way halo in its total stellar mass, metallicity\ndistribution, and the luminosity function and chemical enrichment of dwarf\nsatellite galaxies. These model halos in turn allow an exploration of how the\npopulations of interest for probing the epoch of reionization are distributed\nin physical and phase space, and of how they are related to lower-redshift\npopulations of the same metallicity. The fraction of stars dating from before a\nparticular time or redshift depends strongly on radius within the galaxy,\nreflecting the \"inside-out\" growth of cold-dark-matter halos, and on\nmetallicity, reflecting the general trend toward higher metallicity at later\ntimes. These results suggest that efforts to discover stars from z > 6 - 10\nshould select for stars with [Fe/H] <~ -3 and favor stars on more tightly bound\norbits in the stellar halo, where the majority are from z > 10 and 15 - 40% are\nfrom z > 15. The oldest, most metal-poor stars - those most likely to reveal\nthe chemical abundances of the first stars - are most common in the very center\nof the Galaxy's halo: they are in the bulge, but not of the bulge. These models\nhave several implications for the larger project of constraining the properties\nof the first stars and galaxies using data from the local Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2009 21:39:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

The parameters we vary are the Mach number of the inflow\nvelocity of the streams, Msinf, the rms Mach number of the initial background\nturbulence in the WNM, and the total mass contained in the colliding gas\nstreams, Minf. Because the SFE is a function of time, we define two estimators\nfor it, the \"absolute\" SFE, measured at t = 25 Myr into the simulation's\nevolution (sfeabs), and the \"relative\" SFE, measured 5 Myr after the onset of\nstar formation in each simulation (sferel). The latter is close to the \"star\nformation rate per free-fall time\" for gas at n = 100 cm^-3. We find that both\nestimators decrease with increasing Minf, although by no more than a factor of\n2 as Msinf increases from 1.25 to 3.5. Increasing levels of background\nturbulence similarly reduce the SFE, because the turbulence disrupts the\ncoherence of the colliding streams, fragmenting the cloud, and producing\nsmall-scale clumps scattered through the numerical box, which have low SFEs.\nFinally, the SFE is very sensitive to the mass of the inflows, with sferel\ndecreasing from ~0.4 to ~0.04 as the the virial parameter in the colliding\nstreams increases from ~0.15 to ~1.5. This trend is in partial agreement with\nthe prediction by Krumholz & McKee (2005), since the latter lies within the\nsame range as the observed efficiencies, but with a significantly shallower\nslope. We conclude that the observed variability of the SFE is a highly\nsensitive function of the parameters of the cloud formation process, and may be\nthe cause of significant scatter in observational determinations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2009 22:05:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

As in\nprevious work (Gonzalez et al. 2004a, 2004b), we assume here an interacting,\nnonspherical multiple-phase wind scenario to explain the shape and the\nkinematics of both Homunculi, but adopt a more realistic parametrization of the\nphases of the wind.

We also comment on the condition under\nwhich linear instability of the scalar graviton does not show up.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2009 01:35:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2010 07:41:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-06"}

The adaptive-wave model, representing 'controlled Brownian\nbehavior' of financial markets, is formally defined by adaptive nonlinear\nSchr\\\"odinger (NLS) equations, defining the option-pricing wave function in\nterms of the stock price and time. The model includes two parameters:\nvolatility (playing the role of dispersion frequency coefficient), which can be\neither fixed or stochastic, and adaptive market potential that depends on the\ninterest rate. The wave function represents quantum probability amplitude,\nwhose absolute square is probability density function. Four types of analytical\nsolutions of the NLS equation are provided in terms of Jacobi elliptic\nfunctions, all starting from de Broglie's plane-wave packet associated with the\nfree quantum-mechanical particle. The best agreement with the Black-Scholes\nmodel shows the adaptive shock-wave NLS-solution, which can be efficiently\ncombined with adaptive solitary-wave NLS-solution. Adjustable 'weights' of the\nadaptive market-heat potential are estimated using either unsupervised Hebbian\nlearning, or supervised Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.

The\nother resonance seems to be the $|1{D_2}'>_H$, i.e. the high-mass state in the\n$1^1D_2$-$1^3D_2$ mixing with $J^P=2^-$, of which the $D^*K$ channel is its key\ndecay mode. We also discuss implications arising from these assignments and\ngive predictions for their partner states such as $|(SD)'>_H$, $|2{P'_1}>_H$,\n$2^3P_0$ and $2^3P_2$, which could be helpful for the search for these new\nstates in future experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2009 08:45:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Jan 2010 08:56:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-06"}

We find that for low mass\nhaloes, their residing central galaxies are less massive at high redshift than\nthose at low redshift. For high mass haloes, central galaxies in these haloes\nat high redshift are a bit more massive than the galaxies at low redshift.\nSatellite galaxies are less massive at earlier times, for any given mass of\nhosting haloes.

Because of the heterogeneity of the\nrational agents' expectations, there is a synchronization problem for the\noptimal exit times determined by these arbitrageurs, which leads to the\nsurvival of the bubble almost all the way to its theoretical end time. The\nexplicit exact analytical solutions of the two models provide nonlinear\ntransformations which allow us to develop novel tests for the presence of\nbubbles in financial time series. Avoiding the difficult problem of parameter\nestimation of the stochastic differential equation describing the price\ndynamics, the derived operational procedures allow us to diagnose bubbles that\nare in the making and to forecast their termination time. The tests performed\non three financial markets, the US S&P500 index from 1 February 1980 to 31\nOctober 2008, the US NASDAQ composite index from 1 January 1980 to 31 July 2008\nand the Hong Kong Hang Seng index from 1 December 1986 to 30 November 2008,\nsuggest the feasibility of advance bubble warning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2009 15:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

In this paper, we present six new candidates for (very)\nlow-mass objects in the Taurus star-forming region one of which was recently\ndiscovered in parallel by Luhman et al. (2009). The underlying data we use is\npart of a new database from a deep near-infrared survey at the Calar Alto\nobservatory. The survey is more than four magnitudes deeper than the 2MASS\nsurvey and covers currently ~1.5 square degree. Complementary optical\nphotometry from SDSS were available for roughly 1.0 square degree. After\nselection of the candidates using different color indices, additional\nphotometry from Spitzer/IRAC was included in the analysis. In greater detail we\nfocus on two very faint objects for which we obtained J-band spectra. Based on\ncomparison with reference spectra we derive a spectral type of L2+/-0.5 for one\nobject, making it the object with the latest spectral type in Taurus known\ntoday. From models we find the effective temperature to be 2080+/-140 K and the\nmass 5-15 Jupiter masses. For the second source the J-band spectrum does not\nprovide a definite proof of the young, low-mass nature of the object as the\nexpected steep water vapor absorption at 1.33 micron is not present in the\ndata. We discuss the probability that this object might be a background giant\nor carbon star. If it were a young Taurus member, however, a comparison to\ntheoretical models suggests that it lies close to or even below the deuterium\nburning limit (<13 Jupiter masses) as well. A first proper motion analysis for\nboth objects shows that they are good candidates for being Taurus members.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2009 15:28:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

In these\nexperimental setups it is possible to study coherent time evolution of isolated\nquantum systems. These dynamics reveal new physics beyond the low-energy\nproperties usually relevant in solid-state many-body systems. In this paper we\nstudy the time evolution of antiferromagnetic order in the Heisenberg chain\nafter a sudden change of the anisotropy parameter, using various numerical and\nanalytical methods. As a generic result we find that the order parameter, which\ncan show oscillatory or non-oscillatory dynamics, decays exponentially except\nfor the effectively non-interacting case of the XX limit. For weakly ordered\ninitial states we also find evidence for an algebraic correction to the\nexponential law. The study is based on numerical simulations using a numerical\nmatrix product method for infinite system sizes (iMPS), for which we provide a\ndetailed description and an error analysis. Additionally, we investigate in\ndetail the exactly solvable XX limit. These results are compared to\napproximative analytical approaches including an effective description by the\nXZ-model as well as by mean-field, Luttinger-liquid and sine-Gordon theories.\nThis reveals which aspects of non-equilibrium dynamics can as in equilibrium be\ndescribed by low-energy theories and which are the novel phenomena specific to\nquantum quench dynamics. The relevance of the energetically high part of the\nspectrum is illustrated by means of a full numerical diagonalization of the\nHamiltonian.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2009 15:38:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-04"}

Distance between\nestimate and observation is measured at every vertex in the $L_2$ norm, and\nroughness is penalized on every edge in the $L_1$ norm. Thus the ideas of\ntotal-variation penalization can be extended to a graph. The resulting\nminimization problem presents special computational challenges, so we describe\na new, fast algorithm and demonstrate its use with examples.\n  Further examples include a graphical approach that gives an improved estimate\nof the baseline in spectroscopic analysis, and a simulation applicable to\ndiscrete spatial variation.
