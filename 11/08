Such twisted derivations include regular\nderivations, difference and $q$-difference operators and superderivatives as\nspecial cases. Remarkably, the formulae for the iteration of Darboux\ntransformations are identical with those in the standard case of a regular\nderivation and are expressed in terms of quasideterminants. As an example, we\nrevisit the Darboux transformations for the Manin-Radul super KdV equation,\nstudied in Q.P. Liu and M. Ma\\~nas, Physics Letters B \\textbf{396} 133--140,\n(1997). The new approach we take enables us to derive a unified expression for\nsolution formulae in terms of quasideterminants, covering all cases at once,\nrather than using several subcases. Then, by using a known relationship between\nquasideterminants and superdeterminants, we obtain expressions for these\nsolutions as ratios of superdeterminants. This coincides with the results of\nLiu and Ma\\~nas in all the cases they considered but also deals with the one\nsubcase in which they did not obtain such an expression. Finally, we obtain\nanother type of quasideterminant solutions to the Main-Radul super KdV equation\nconstructed from its binary Darboux transformations. These can also be\nexpressed as ratios of superdeterminants and are a substantial generalization\nof the solutions constructed using binary Darboux transformations in earlier\nwork on this topic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Nov 2009 02:25:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Practical situations where the generalized model potentially\nleads to more accurate variance estimates are identified as: clustering of\nparticles, differences in densities or sizes of the particles or repulsive\ninter-particle forces. Two general approaches for estimating an input parameter\nfor the generalized model are discussed. The first approach consists of\nmodelling based on physical properties of particles such as size, density and\nelectrostatic forces between particles. The second approach uses image analysis\nof actual samples. Further research into both methods is proposed and a\nsuggestion is made to use line-intercept sampling combined with Markov Chain\nmodelling in the second approach.\n  It is concluded that although, at the moment, it is too early for a routine\napplication of the generalized theory, the generalization has the potential of\nproviding more accurate variance estimates than are possible in the theory of\nGy. Therefore, further research into the development and expansion of the\ngeneralized theory is worthwhile.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Nov 2009 22:29:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We perform many\ndirect $N$-body simulations with various initial conditions and two different\nchoices of IMFs. One is a standard Kroupa IMF without any mass segregation. The\nother is a radially dependent IMF, as presently observed in the Arches. We find\nthat it is unlikely for the Arches to have attained the observed degree of mass\nsegregation at its current age starting from a standard non-segregated Kroupa\nIMF. We also study the possibility of a collisional runaway developing in the\nfirst $\\sim 2-3 \\rm{Myr}$ of dynamical evolution. We find that the evolution of\nthis cluster is dramatically different depending on the choice of IMF: if a\nprimordially mass segregated IMF is chosen, a collisional runaway should always\noccur between $2-3 \\rm{Myr}$ for a broad range of initial concentrations. In\ncontrast, for a standard Kroupa IMF no collisional runaway is predicted. We\nargue that if Arches was created with a mass segregated IMF similar to what is\nobserved today then at the current cluster age a very unusual, high-mass star\nshould be created. However, whether a collisional runaway leads to the\nformation of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) depends strongly on the\nmass loss rate via winds from massive stars. Growth of stellar mass through\ncollisions can be quenched by strong wind mass loss. In that case, the\ninter-cluster as well as intra-cluster medium are expected to have a\nsignificant Helium enrichment which may be observed via Helium recombination\nlines. The excess amount of gas lost in winds may also be observed via X-ray\nobservations as diffused X-ray sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Nov 2009 03:02:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The origin of such extended emission (found in about a quarter of Swift\nshort GRBs) is still unclear and may provide some clues to the identity of the\nelusive progenitors of short GRBs. The extended emission from GRB 080503 is\nfollowed by a rapid decay phase (RDP) that is detected over an unusually large\ndynamical range (one decade in time and ~3.5 decades in flux). We model the\nbroad envelope of extended emission and the subsequent RDP using a physical\nmodel (Genet & Granot 2009), in which the prompt emission (and its tail) is the\nsum of its individual pulses (and their tails). For GRB 080503, a single pulse\nfit is found to be unacceptable. The RDP displays very strong spectral\nevolution and shows some evidence for the presence of two spectral components\nwith different temporal behaviour, likely arising from distinct physical\nregions. A two pulse fit provides a much better fit to the data. The shallow\ngamma-ray and steep hard X-ray decays are hard to account for simultaneously,\nand require the second pulse to deviate from the simplest version of the model\nwe use. Therefore, while high latitude emission is a viable explanation for the\nRDP in GRB080503, it is quite plausible that another mechanism is at work here.\nFinally, we note that the properties of the RDP following the extended emission\nof short GRBs appear to have different properties than that following the\nprompt emission of long GRBs. However, a larger sample of short GRBs with\nextended emission is required before any strong conclusion can be drawn.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Nov 2009 09:56:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2010 13:10:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The MHD calculations use the stratified shearing-box approach and\ninclude grain settling and the feedback from the changing dust abundance on the\nresistivity of the gas. The two-decade spread in accretion rates among T Tauri\nstars is too large to result solely from variety in the grain size and stellar\nX-ray luminosity, but can be produced by varying these together with the disk\nmagnetic flux. The diversity in the silicate bands can come from the coupling\nof grain settling to the distribution of the magneto-rotational turbulence,\nthrough three effects: (1) Recombination on grains yields a magnetically\ninactive dead zone extending above two scale heights, while turbulence in the\nmagnetically active disk atmosphere overshoots the dead zone boundary by only\nabout one scale height. (2) Grains deep in the dead zone oscillate vertically\nin waves driven by the turbulent layer above, but on average settle at the\nlaminar rates, so the interior of the dead zone is a particle sink and the disk\natmosphere becomes dust-depleted. (3) With sufficient depletion, the dead zone\nis thinner and mixing dredges grains off the midplane. The MHD results also\nshow that the magnetic activity intermittently lifts clouds of dust into the\natmosphere. The photosphere height changes by up to one-third over a few\norbits, while the extinction along lines of sight grazing the disk surface\nvaries by factors of two over times down to 0.1 orbit.
