Evidently, having a distinct sub-THz\ncomponent requires either a distinct emission mechanism (compared to the GS\none), or different properties of electrons and location, or both. We find,\nhowever, that the list of possible emission mechanisms is incomplete. This\nLetter proposes a more complete list of emission mechanisms, capable of\nproducing a sub-THz component, both well-known and new in this context and\ncalculates a representative set of their spectra produced by a) free-free\nemission, b) gyrosynchrotron emission, c) synchrotron emission from\nrelativistic positrons/electrons, d) diffusive radiation, and e) Cherenkov\nemission. We discuss the possible role of the mechanisms in forming the sub-THz\nemission and emphasize their diagnostics potential for flares.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Nov 2009 23:49:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2009 01:51:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

[1] one of the authors proposed postulates for axiomatizing Quantum\nMechanics as a \"fair operational framework\", namely regarding the theory as a\nset of rules that allow the experimenter to predict future events on the basis\nof suitable tests, having local control and low experimental complexity. In\naddition to causality, the following postulates have been considered: PFAITH\n(existence of a pure preparationally faithful state), and FAITHE (existence of\na faithful effect). These postulates have exhibited an unexpected theoretical\npower, excluding all known nonquantum probabilistic theories. Later in Ref. [2]\nin addition to causality and PFAITH, postulate LDISCR (local discriminability)\nand PURIFY (purifiability of all states) have been considered, narrowing the\nprobabilistic theory to something very close to Quantum Mechanics. In the\npresent paper we test the above postulates on some nonquantum probabilistic\nmodels. The first model, \"the two-box world\" is an extension of the\nPopescu-Rohrlich model, which achieves the greatest violation of the CHSH\ninequality compatible with the no-signaling principle. The second model \"the\ntwo-clock world\" is actually a full class of models, all having a disk as\nconvex set of states for the local system. One of them corresponds to the \"the\ntwo-rebit world\", namely qubits with real Hilbert space. The third model--\"the\nspin-factor\"--is a sort of n-dimensional generalization of the clock. Finally\nthe last model is \"the classical probabilistic theory\". We see how each model\nviolates some of the proposed postulates, when and how teleportation can be\nachieved, and we analyze other interesting connections between these postulate\nviolations, along with deep relations between the local and the non-local\nstructures of the probabilistic theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Nov 2009 18:34:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2009 13:23:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-12"}

In equilibrium we find\nexcellent agreement with NRG results for the linear conductance at finite gate\nvoltage, magnetic field, and temperature. In nonequilibrium, our results for\nthe current agree well with TD-DMRG. For the nonlinear conductance as function\nof the bias voltage, we propose reliable results at finite magnetic field and\nfinite temperature. Furthermore, we demonstrate the exponentially small scale\nof the Kondo temperature to appear in the second order derivative of the\nself-energy. We show that the approximation is, however, not able to reproduce\nthe scaling of the effective mass at large interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2009 11:01:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 May 2010 10:26:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-28"}

This touches upon the issue\nof the number of degrees of freedom contained by one such network. Using the\nmetabolic network of Escherichia coli as a model system, here we address this\nquestion theoretically by exploring not only reaction deletions, but also a\ncontinuum of all possible reaction expression levels.

In particular, a relevant fraction of the metabolic\nreactions exhibits canalizing interactions, in that the specification of one\nreaction flux determines cellular growth as well as the fluxes of most other\nreactions in optimal steady states. The activity of individual reactions can\nthus be used as surrogates to monitor and possibly control cellular growth and\nother whole-cell behaviors.

Finally, while 133P's trail appears shorter and weaker in 2007 than\nin 2002, other measures of activity strength such as dust velocity and coma\ncontamination of nucleus photometry are found to remain approximately constant.\nWe attribute changes in trail strength to the timing of observations and\nprojection effects, thus finding no evidence of any substantial decrease in\nactivity strength between 2002 and 2007.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Nov 2009 22:26:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

We discuss quantum effects of the strong fields on the\ndisk, and use the MHD conservation equations to describe the behavior of the\ndisk flow coupled with a large scale field, which is generated by the star-disk\ninteraction. In general, stronger fields give higher disk densities, pressures,\ntemperatures and neutrino luminosity, and change the electron fraction and\ndegeneracy state significantly. A magnetized disk is always viscously stable\noutside the Alfv\\'{e}n radius, but will be thermally unstable near the\nAlfv\\'{e}n radius where the magnetic field plays a more important role in\ntransferring the angular momentum and heating the disk than the viscous stress.\nThe funnel accretion process will be only important for an extremely strong\nfield, which creates a magnetosphere inside the Alfv\\'{e}n radius and truncates\nthe plane disk. Because of higher temperature and more concentrated neutrino\nemission of the magnetar surface ring-like belt region covered by funnel\naccretion, the neutrino annihilation rate from the accreting magnetars can be\nmuch higher than that from accreting neutron stars without fields.

The La luminosity in our simulations is\npowered by the release of gravitational energy as gas flows from the\nintergalactic medium into the halo potential wells. The UV background\ncontributes only <20% to the gas heating. The La emissivity is due primarily to\nelectron-impact excitation cooling radiation in gas ~2x10^4K. We calculate the\nLa emissivities assuming collisional ionisation equilibrium (CIE) at all gas\ntemperatures. The simulated streams are self-shielded against the UV\nbackground, so photoionisation and recombination contribute negligibly to the\nLa line formation. We produce theoretical maps of the La surface brightnesses,\nassuming that ~85% of the La photons are directly observable. We find that\ntypical haloes of mass Mv~10^12-13 Msun at z~3 emit as La blobs (LABs) with\nluminosities 10^43-44 erg/s. Most of the La comes from the extended narrow,\npartly clumpy, inflowing, cold streams that feed the growing galaxies. The\npredicted LAB morphology is therefore irregular, with dense clumps and\nelongated extensions. The linewidth is expected to range from 10^2 to more than\n10^3 km/s with a large variance. The typical La surface brightness profile is\nproportional to r^-1.2 where r is the distance from the halo centre. Our\nsimulated LABs are similar in luminosity, morphology and extent to the observed\nLABs, with distinct kinematic features. The predicted La luminosity function is\nconsistent with observations, and the predicted areas and linewidths roughly\nrecover the observed scaling relations. This mechanism for producing LABs\nappears inevitable in many high-z galaxies. Some of the LABs may thus be\nregarded as direct detections of the cold streams that drove galaxy evolution\nat high z.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2009 08:02:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2010 16:34:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-07"}

The\nbackground from single or two electromagnetic subcascdes is concentrated at\nenergies below 200 GeV. Finally the number of background events is compared to\nthe number of VHE gamma-ray excess events from the Crab Nebula. The\ninvestigated background survives simple cuts for sizes below 250 p.e. and thus\nthe experiment's sensitivity deteriorates at lower energies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2009 08:54:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

In this paper, we analyze the light curves of microlensing events\nOGLE-2007-BLG-137/MOA-2007-BLG-091, OGLE-2007-BLG-355/MOA-2007-BLG-278, and\nMOA-2007-BLG-199/OGLE-2007-BLG-419, for all of which exhibit short-term\nperturbations near the peaks of the light curves.

From close examination of the light curves\ncombined with the underlying physical geometry of the lens system obtained from\nmodeling, we find that the short time-scale caustic-crossing feature occurring\nat a low or a moderate base magnification with an additional secondary\nperturbation is a typical feature of binary-lens events and thus can be used\nfor the discrimination between the binary and planetary interpretations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2009 08:59:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The number of particles becoming unbounded depends on\norbital configuration, with hyperbolic encounters producing a larger luminous\nintracluster population than parabolic encounters. Furthermore, in simulations\nwith identical orbital parameters, a lower M_T/M_L of the colliding galaxies\nproduces a larger fraction of unbounded luminous particles.

When small-amplitude particles are removed, the\nremaining ones therefore have a larger transverse emittance. This effect,\ncalled core depletion, may cause a decrease in luminosity. An approximate\nanalytic model is developed to study the effect and benchmarked against a\nmultiparticle tracking simulation. Finally, the time evolution of the intensity\nand emittances of a Pb bunch in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN is\ncalculated, taking into account also other processes than collisions. The\nresults show that integrated luminosity drops by 3--4% if core depletion is\ntaken into account.

We have proposed a new method to calibrate GRB\ndistance indicators with Type Ia supernova (SNe Ia) data in a completely\ncosmology-independent way to avoid the circularity problem that had limited the\ndirect use of GRBs to probe cosmology [N. Liang, W. K. Xiao, Y. Liu, and S. N.\nZhang, Astrophys. J. 685, 354 (2008).]. In this paper, a simple method is\nprovided to combine GRB data into the joint observational data analysis to\nconstrain cosmological models; in this method those SNe Ia data points used for\ncalibrating the GRB data are not used to avoid any correlation between them. We\nfind that the $\\Lambda$CDM model is consistent with the joint data in the\n1-$\\sigma$ confidence region, using the GRB data at high redshift calibrated\nwith the interpolating method, the Constitution set of SNe Ia, the cosmic\nmicrowave background radiation from Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe five\nyear observation, the baryonic acoustic oscillation from the spectroscopic\nSloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 galaxy sample, the x-ray baryon mass\nfraction in clusters of galaxies, and the observational Hubble parameter versus\nredshift data. Comparing to the joint constraints with GRBs and without GRBs,\nwe find that the contribution of GRBs to the joint cosmological constraints is\na slight shift in the confidence regions of cosmological parameters to better\nenclose the $\\Lambda$CDM model. Finally, we reconstruct the acceleration\nhistory of the Universe up to $z>6$ with the distance moduli of SNe Ia and GRBs\nand find some features that deviate from the $\\Lambda$CDM model and seem to\nfavor oscillatory cosmology models; however further investigations are needed\nto better understand the situation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2009 14:46:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2009 13:56:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 17 Mar 2010 10:29:06 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 20 Apr 2010 07:14:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-22"}

Methods: We derive near-infrared dust extinction maps for 23 molecular\ncloud complexes, using the \"nicest\" colour excess mapping technique and data\nfrom the 2MASS archive. The extinction maps are then used to examine the column\ndensity PDFs in the clouds. Results: The column density PDFs of most molecular\nclouds are well-fitted by log-normal functions at low column densities (0.5 mag\n< A_v < 3-5 mag). However, at higher column densities prominent, power-law-like\nwings are common. In particular, we identify a trend among the PDFs: active\nstar-forming clouds always have prominent non-log-normal wings. In contrast,\nclouds without active star formation resemble log-normals over the whole\nobserved column density range, or show only low excess of higher column\ndensities. This trend is also reflected in the cumulative PDFs, showing that\nthe fraction of high column density material is significantly larger in\nstar-forming clouds. These observations are in agreement with an evolutionary\ntrend where turbulent motions are the main cloud-shaping mechanism for\nquiescent clouds, but the density enhancements induced by them quickly become\ndominated by gravity (and other mechanisms) which is strongly reflected by the\nshape of the column density PDFs. The dominant role of the turbulence is\nrestricted to the very early stages of molecular cloud evolution, comparable to\nthe onset of active star formation in the clouds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2009 14:14:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

This\nis partly due to uncertainties about their existence. Are there galaxies\nisolated enough to be interesting? Do they exist in sufficient numbers to be\nstatistically useful? Most attempts to compile isolated galaxy lists were\nmarginally successful--too small number and not very isolated galaxies. If\nreally isolated galaxies do exist then their value becomes obvious in a\nUniverse where effects of interactions and environment (i.e. nurture) are\nimportant. They provide a means for better quantifying effects of nurture. The\nCatalog of Isolated Galaxies (CIG) compiled by Valentina Karachentseva appeared\nnear the beginning of the review period. It becomes the focus of this review\nbecause of its obvious strengths and because the AMIGA project has increased\nits utility through a refinement (a vetted CIG). It contains almost 1000\ngalaxies with nearest neighbor crossing times of 1-3Gyr. It is large enough to\nserve as a zero-point or control sample. The galaxies in the CIG (and the\ndistribution of galaxy types) may be significantly different than those in even\nslightly richer environments. The AMIGA-CIG, and future iterations, may be able\nto tell us something about galaxy formation. It may also allow us to better\ndefine intrinsic (natural) correlations like e.g. Fisher-Tully and FIR-OPTICAL.\nCorrelations can be better defined when the dispersion added by external\nstimuli (nurture) is minimized or removed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2009 15:07:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-01"}

In the present study we\nartificially engineer short-range order by depositing Pd-capped Mg/Ti\nmultilayers with different periodicities and characterize them both\nstructurally and optically. Notwithstanding the large lattice parameter\nmismatch between Mg and Ti, the as-deposited metallic multilayers show good\nstructural coherence. Upon exposure to H2 gas a two-step hydrogenation process\noccurs, with the Ti layers forming the hydride before Mg. From in-situ\nmeasurements of the bilayer thickness L at different hydrogen pressures, we\nobserve large out-of-plane expansions of the Mg and Ti layers upon\nhydrogenation, indicating strong plastic deformations in the films and a\nconsequent shortening of the coherence length. Upon unloading at room\ntemperature in air, hydrogen atoms remain trapped in the Ti layers due to\nkinetic constraints. Such loading/unloading sequence can be explained in terms\nof the different thermodynamic properties of hydrogen in Mg and Ti, as shown by\ndiffusion calculations on a model multilayered systems. Absorption isotherms\nmeasured by hydrogenography can be interpreted as a result of the elastic\nclamping arising from strongly bonded Mg/Pd and broken Mg/Ti interfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2009 15:35:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

In the zircon-structured oxides we found evidence\nof a reversible pressure-induced structural phase transformation from zircon to\na monazite-type structure. The onset of the transition is near 17-20 GPa. In\nLaPO4 a non-reversible transition is found around 26 GPa, being a barite-type\nstructure proposed for the high-pressure phase. In the other three monazites,\nthis structure is found to be stable up to highest pressure reached in the\nexperiments. No additional phase transitions or evidences of chemical\ndecomposition are found in the experiments. The equations of state and axial\ncompressibility for the different phases are also determined. In particular, we\nfound that in a given compound the monazite structure is less compressible than\nzircon structure, being this fact related to the larger packing efficiency of\nmonazite compared with zircon. The differential bond compressibility of\ndifferent polyhedra is also reported and related the anisotropic\ncompressibility of both structures.
