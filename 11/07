Most of the morphological evolution from z=1 to z=0.2 takes\nplace at masses 5e10 - 1e11 Msol, where: (i) The fraction of spirals\nsubstantially drops and the contribution of early-types increases. This\nincrease is mostly produced by the growth of bulge-dominated disks, which vary\ntheir contribution from ~10% at z=1 to >30% at z=0.2 (cf. the elliptical\nfraction grows from ~15% to ~20%). Thus, at these masses, transformations from\nlate- to early-types result in disk-less elliptical morphologies with a\nstatistical frequency of only 30% - 40%. Otherwise, the processes which are\nresponsible for the transformations either retain or produce a non-negligible\ndisk component. (ii) The bulge-less disk galaxies, which contribute ~15% to the\nintermediate-mass galaxy population at z=1, virtually disappear by z=0.2. The\nmerger rate since z=1 is too low to account for the disappearance of these\nmassive bulge-less disks, which most likely grow a bulge via secular evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2009 20:14:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The\nexcitation energy vanishes algebraically for long ramp times with an exponent\nthat depends on whether the ramp takes place within the metallic phase, within\nthe insulating phase, or across the Mott transition line. For ramps within\nmetallic or insulating phase the exponents are in agreement with a perturbative\nanalysis for small ramps. The perturbative expression quite generally shows\nthat the exponent depends explicitly on the spectrum of the system in the\ninitial state and on the smoothness of the ramp protocol. This explains the\nqualitatively different behavior of gapless (e.g., metallic) and gapped (e.g.,\nMott insulating) systems. For gapped systems the asymptotic behavior of the\nexcitation energy depends only on the ramp protocol and its decay becomes\nfaster for smoother ramps. For gapless systems and sufficiently smooth ramps\nthe asymptotics are ramp-independent and depend only on the intrinsic spectrum\nof the system. However, the intrinsic behavior is unobservable if the ramp is\nnot smooth enough. This is relevant for ramps to small interaction in the\nfermionic Hubbard model, where the intrinsic cubic fall-off of the excitation\nenergy cannot be observed for a linear ramp due to its kinks at the beginning\nand the end.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2009 18:03:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-01"}

The Coronagraphic Low Order Wavefront Sensor (CLOWFS)\nproduces a defocused image of a reflective focal plane ring to measure low\norder aberrations. Even for small levels of wavefront aberration, the proposed\nscheme produces large intensity signals which can be easily measured, and\ntherefore does not require highly accurate calibration of either the detector\nor optical elements.

We find that,\nalthough such systems can remain stable at low relative inclinations ($\\lesssim\n40^\\circ$), high relative inclinations are likely to lead to instabilities.\nThis can be avoided if the planets are placed in a \\emph{Kozai-stable zone}\nwithin which mutual gravitational perturbations can suppress the Kozai\nmechanism.\n  We investigate the possibility of inducing Kozai oscillations in the inner\norbit by a weak coupling mechanism between the planets in which the coplanarity\nis broken due to a differential nodal precession. Propagating perturbations\nfrom the stellar companion through a planetary system in this manner can have\ndramatic effects on the dynamical evolution of planetary systems, especially in\ntight binaries and can offer a reasonable explanation for eccentricity trends\namong planets observed in binary systems. We find that inducing such\noscillations into the orbit of a hot Jupiter is more likely in tight binaries\nand an upper limit can be set on the binary separation above which these\noscillations are not observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2009 19:45:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

This implies the existence of a\npurely photometric scaling law obtained by projecting such a line onto the\nlog(Re), SBe plane. Such photometric quantities are readily available for large\nsamples of clusters, as opposed to stellar velocity dispersion data. We study a\nsample of 129 Galactic and extragalactic clusters on such photometric plane in\nthe V-band. We look for a linear relation between SBe and log(Re) and study how\nthe scatter around it is influenced by age and dynamical environment. We\ninterpret our results as a test on the evolutionary versus primordial origin of\nthe Fundamental Line. We perform a detailed analysis of surface brightness\nprofiles, which allows us to present a catalogue of structural properties,\nwithout relying on a given dynamical model. We find a linear relation between\nSBe and log(Re), in the form SBe = (5.25 +- 0.44) log(Re) + (15.58 +- 0.28),\nwhere SBe is measured in mag/arcsec^2 and Re in parsec. Both young and old\nclusters lie on the scaling law, with a scatter of approximately 1 mag in SBe.\nHowever, young clusters display more scatter and a clear trend of such scatter\nwith age, which old clusters do not. Such trend becomes tighter if cluster age\nis measured in units of the cluster half-light relaxation time. Two-body\nrelaxation therefore plays a major role, together with passive stellar\npopulation evolution, in shaping the relation between SBe, log(Re), and cluster\nage. We argue that the log(Re)-SBe relation and hence the Fundamental Line\nscaling law is not primordially set at cluster formation, but rather is the\nresult of combined stellar evolution and collisional dynamical evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2009 21:36:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2010 18:25:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Instead, the long-lived capture orbits subsequently evolve inward\ndue to interactions with a tenuous circumplanetary gas disk.\n  We focus on the capture by Jupiter, which, due to its large mass, provides\nthe most stringent test of our model.

Such spot-sensing applications approximate the\nphysical condition of the entire region of interest by the measurements made at\nonly the points where the sensor nodes are located. Given a certain density of\nnodes in a region, a more spatially uniform distribution of the nodes leads to\na better approximation of the physical condition of the region. This report\nconsiders the error in this approximation and seeks to improve the quality of\nrepresentation of the physical condition of the points in the region in the\ndata collected by the sensor network. We develop two essential metrics which\ntogether allow a rigorous quantitative assessment of the quality of\nrepresentation achieved: the average representation error and the unevenness of\nrepresentation error, the latter based on a well-accepted measure of inequality\nused in economics. We present the rationale behind the use of these metrics and\nderive relevant theoretical bounds on them in the common scenario of a planar\nregion of arbitrary shape covered by a sensor network deployment. A simple new\nheuristic algorithm is presented for each node to determine if and when it\nshould sense or sleep to conserve energy while also preserving the quality of\nrepresentation.

We first discuss the breakdown of\naffine assumptions that underlies the rich mechanics near jamming. We then\nextensively discuss jamming of frictionless soft spheres.

Finally we discuss current explorations of jamming of\nfrictional and non-spherical (ellipsoidal) particles. Both friction and\nasphericity tune the contact number at jamming away from the isostatic limit,\nbut in opposite directions. This allows one to disentangle distance to jamming\nand distance to isostaticity. The picture that emerges is that most quantities\nare governed by the contact number and scale with distance to isostaticity,\nwhile the contact number itself scales with distance to jamming.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Nov 2009 02:12:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

A detailed presentation of this analysis is dicussed\nin Wu et al. (2009).\n  We find that on average, the 15-30micron slope of the continuum is\n-0.85+/-0.61 for Seyfert 1s and -1.53+/-0.84 for Seyfert 2s, and there is\nsubstantial scatter in each type. Moreover, nearly 32% of Seyfert 1s, and 9% of\nSeyfert 2s, display a peak in the mid-infrared spectrum at 20micron, which is\nattributed to an additional hot dust component. The Polycyclic Aromatic\nHydrocarbon (PAH) equivalent width decreases with increasing dust temperature,\nas indicated by the global infrared color of the host galaxies. However, no\nstatistical difference in PAH equivalent width is detected between the two\nSeyfert types, 1 and 2, of the same bolometric luminosity. Finally, we propose\na new method to estimate the AGN contribution to the integrated 12micron galaxy\nemission, by subtracting the \"star formation\" component in the Seyfert\ngalaxies, making use of the tight correlation between PAH 11.2micron luminosity\nand 12micron luminosity for star forming galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Nov 2009 15:38:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}
