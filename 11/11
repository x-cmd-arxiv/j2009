The novelty is that these 2-D mean field dynamo models\nincorporate scaling laws deduced from 3-D hydrodynamical simulations for the\ninfluence of rotation rate on the amplitude and profile of the meridional\ncirculation. These models make also use of observational scaling laws for the\nvariation of differential rotation with rotation rate.

We use the recently developed disk code ProDiMo to calculate the\nphysico-chemical structure of protoplanetary disks and apply the Monte-Carlo\nline radiative transfer code RATRAN to predict observable line profiles and\nfluxes. We consider a series of Herbig Ae type disk models ranging from 10^-6\nM_Sun to 2.2 10^-2 M_Sun (between 0.5 and 700 AU) to discuss the dependency of\nthe line fluxes and ratios on disk mass for otherwise fixed disk parameters.\nResults. We find the [CII] 157.7 mum line to originate in LTE from the surface\nlayers of the disk, where Tg > Td . The total emission is dominated by surface\narea and hence depends strongly on disk outer radius. The [OI] lines can be\nvery bright (> 10^-16 W/m^2) and form in slightly deeper and closer regions\nunder non-LTE conditions. The high-excitation [OI] 145.5 mum line, which has a\nlarger critical density, decreases more rapidly with disk mass than the 63.2\nmum line. Therefore, the [OI] 63.2 mum/145.5 mum ratio is a promising disk mass\nindicator, especially as it is independent of disk outer radius for Rout > 200\nAU. CO is abundant only in deeper layers A_V >~ 0.05. For too low disk masses\n(M_disk <~10^-4 M_Sun) the dust starts to become transparent, and CO is almost\ncompletely photo-dissociated.

Using a variety of statistical tests, we find\nthat Lya equivalent width and age, SFR, and dust extinction, respectively, are\nsignificantly correlated in the sense that objects with strong Lya emission\nalso tend to be older, lower in star formation rate, and less dusty than\nobjects with weak Lya emission, or the line in absorption. We accordingly\nconclude that, within the LBG sample, objects with strong Lya emission\nrepresent a later stage of galaxy evolution in which supernovae-induced\noutflows have reduced the dust covering fraction.

However,\nsimple null models often show much less clustering than their real-world\ncounterparts. In this paper, we study a model where clustering is enhanced by\nmeans of a fugacity term as in the Strauss (or \"triangle\") model, but where the\ndegree sequence is strictly preserved -- thus maintaining the quenched\nheterogeneity of nodes found in the original degree sequence. Similar models\nhad been proposed previously in [R. Milo et al., Science 298, 824 (2002)]. We\nfind that our model exhibits phase transitions as the fugacity is changed. For\nregular graphs (identical degrees for all nodes) with degree k > 2 we find a\nsingle first order transition. For all non-regular networks that we studied\n(including Erdos - Renyi and scale-free networks) we find multiple jumps\nresembling first order transitions, together with strong hysteresis. The latter\ntransitions are driven by the sudden emergence of \"cluster cores\": groups of\nhighly interconnected nodes with higher than average degrees.

It has been cited as evidence for a mass outflow\nfrom our GC region, which has inspired diverse models for its origin. However,\nmost work has focused on the morphology of the GC lobe, which has made it\ndifficult to draw strong conclusions about its nature. Here, I present a\ncoherent, multiwavelength analysis of new and archival observations of the GC\nlobe. Radio continuum emission shows that the GC lobe has a magnetized layer\nwith a diameter of 110 pc and an equipartition field strength ranging from 40\nto 100 $\\mu$G. Recombination line emission traces an ionized shell nested\nwithin the radio continuum with diameter of 80 pc and height 165 pc.\nMid-infrared maps at 8 and 15 $\\mu$m show that the GC lobe has a third layer of\nwarm dust and PAH-emission that surrounds the radio continuum shell with a\ndiameter of 130 pc. Assuming adiabatic expansion of the gas in the GC lobe, its\nformation required an energy input of about $5\\times10^{52}$ ergs. I compare\nthe physical conditions of the GC lobe to several models and find best\nagreement with the canonical starburst outflow model. The formation of the GC\nlobe is consistent with the currently observed pressure and star formation rate\nin the central tens of parsecs of our Galaxy. Outflows of this scale are more\ntypical of dwarf galaxies and would not be easily detected in nearby spiral\ngalaxies. Thus, the existence of such an outflow in our own Galaxy may indicate\nthat it is relatively common phenomenon in the nuclei of spiral galaxies.\n(Abridged)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2009 06:09:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

Since there is $^3$P$_2$ neutron superfluid in neutron\nstar interior, it can be treated as a system of magnetic dipoles. Under the\npresence of background magnetic field, the magnetic dipoles tend to align in\nthe same direction. Below a critical temperature, there is a phase transition\nfrom paramagnetism to ferromagnetism. And this gives a convenient explanation\nof the strong magnetic field of magnetars. In our point of view, there is an\nupper limit for the magnetic field strength of magnetars. The maximum field\nstrength of magnetars is about $(3.0-4.0)\\times 10^{15}$ G. This can be tested\ndirectly by further investigations.\n  Magnetars are instable due to the ultra high Fermi energy of electrons. The\nLandau column becomes a very long cylinder along the magnetic field, but it is\nvery narrow and the Fermi energy of electron gas is given as\n$E_F(e)\\approx40(B/B_{cr})^{1/4}$ when $B\\gg B_{cr}$. $E_F(e)\\approx90MeV$ When\n$B\\sim10^{15}$ G. Hence, the electron capture process $e^-+p\\to n+\\nu_e$ will\nbe happen rapidly. Thus the $^3$P$_2$ Cooper pairs will be destroyed quickly by\nthe outgoing neutrons with high energy. It will cause the isotropic superfluid\ndisappear and then the magnetic field induced by the $^3$P$_2$ Cooper pairs\nwill be also disappear. These energy will immediately be transmitted into\nthermal energy and then transformed into the radiation energy with X-ray - soft\n$\\gamma$-ray. We may get a conclusion that the activity of magnetars originates\nfrom instability caused by the high Fermi energy of electrons in extra strong\nmagnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2009 07:14:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-12"}

In particular, we found that the\nphilosophy underlying current empirical network designing and engineering fails\nto meet the cost-effective and evolvable requirements of network designing. We\ndemonstrated that the efficient routing combined with effective betweenness\nbased link bandwidth allocation scheme is a cost-effective and scalable design\nfor BA-like scale-free networks, whereas if other designing choices cannot be\ndetermined beforehand, ER network is a markedly good candidate for\ncost-effective and scalable design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2009 08:09:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-12"}

By mollifying the density of\nstates we obtain an approximate free energy and an adaptive bias potential that\nis computed directly from the population along the coordinates of the free\nenergy. Because of the mollifier, the bias potential is \"nonlocal\" and its\ngradient admits a simple analytic expression. A single observation of the\nreaction coordinate can thus be used to update the approximate free energy at\nevery point within a neighborhood of the observation. This greatly reduces the\nequilibration time of the adaptive bias potential. This approximation\nintroduces two parameters: strength of mollification and the zero of energy of\nthe bias potential. While we observe that the approximate free energy is a very\ngood estimate of the actual free energy for a large range of mollification\nstrength, we demonstrate that the errors associated with the mollification may\nbe removed via deconvolution. The zero of energy of the bias potential, which\nis easy to choose, influences the speed of convergence but not the limiting\naccuracy. This method is simple to apply to free energy or mean force\ncomputation in multiple dimensions and does not involve second derivatives of\nthe reaction coordinates, matrix manipulations nor on-the-fly adaptation of\nparameters. For the alanine dipeptide test case, the new method is found to\ngain as much as a factor of ten in efficiency as compared to two common\nadaptive biasing force formulations and it is shown to be as efficient as\nwell-tempered metadynamics with the post-process deconvolution giving a clear\nadvantage to the mollified density of states method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2009 09:37:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2010 13:29:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-29"}

The upper bound on the choice number\nof $G$ obtained via their method, was later coined the \\emph{Alon-Tarsi number\nof $G$} and was denoted by $AT(G)$. They have provided a combinatorial\ninterpretation of this parameter in terms of the eulerian subdigraphs of an\nappropriate orientation of $G$. Their characterization can be restated as\nfollows. Let $D$ be an orientation of $G$. Assign a weight $\\omega_D(H)$ to\nevery subdigraph $H$ of $D$: if $H \\subseteq D$ is eulerian, then $\\omega_D(H)\n= (-1)^{e(H)}$, otherwise $\\omega_D(H) = 0$. Alon and Tarsi proved that $AT(G)\n\\leq k$ if and only if there exists an orientation $D$ of $G$ in which the\nout-degree of every vertex is strictly less than $k$, and moreover $\\sum_{H\n\\subseteq D} \\omega_D(H) \\neq 0$. Shortly afterwards, for the special case of\nline graphs of $d$-regular $d$-edge-colorable graphs, Alon gave another\ninterpretation of $AT(G)$, this time in terms of the signed $d$-colorings of\nthe line graph. In this paper we generalize both results. The first\ncharacterization is generalized by showing that there is an infinite family of\nweight functions (which includes the one considered by Alon and Tarsi), each of\nwhich can be used to characterize $AT(G)$. The second characterization is\ngeneralized to all graphs (in fact the result is even more general -- in\nparticular it applies to hypergraphs). We then use the second generalization to\nprove that $\\chi(G) = ch(G) = AT(G)$ holds for certain families of graphs $G$.\nSome of these results generalize certain known choosability results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2009 10:23:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-12"}

However, such a theory has been proved to be hard to attain\ndue to i) conceptual difficulties present in both the component theories\n(General Relativity (GR) and Quantum Theory); ii) lack of experimental\nevidence, since the regimes at which quantum gravity is expected to be\napplicable are far beyond the range of conceivable experiments. Despite these\ndifficulties, various approaches for a theory of Quantum Gravity have been\ndeveloped.\n  In this thesis we focus on two such approaches: Loop Quantum Gravity and the\nTopos theoretic approach. The choice fell on these approaches because, although\nthey both reject the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory, their\nunderpinning philosophical approach to formulating a quantum theory of gravity\nare radically different. In particular LQG is a rather conservative scheme,\ninheriting all the formalism of both GR and Quantum Theory, as it tries to\nbring to its logical extreme consequences the possibility of combining the two.\nOn the other hand, the Topos approach involves the idea that a radical change\nof perspective is needed in order to solve the problem of quantum gravity,\nespecially in regard to the fundamental concepts of `space' and `time'. Given\nthe partial successes of both approaches, the hope is that it might be possible\nto find a common ground in which each approach can enrich the other.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2009 13:40:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-12"}

Two important\nman-made classes of materials have emerged to mold the flow of electromagnetic\nwaves. Firstly, photonic crystals are dielectric nanostructures that can be\nused to confine and slow down light and control its emission. They act\nprimarily on the electric component of the light field. More recently, a novel\nclass of metallo-dielectric nanostructures has emerged. These so-called\nmetamaterials enable fascinating phenomena, such as negative refraction,\nsuper-focusing and cloaking. This second class of materials realizes light\ncontrol through effective interactions with both electric and magnetic\ncomponent.

The paper\nbegins by describing a nonlinear mechanism of oscillatory mode mixing\nexplaining such behaviors and establishes a generic dynamical scenario with\nextraordinary oscillatory possibilities, including expansive growing\nscalability. The relation of the scenario to the oscillatory behaviors of\nturbulent fluids and living brains is discussed. Finally, by considering the\nscenario as a dynamic substrate underlying generic aspects of both the\nfunctioning and the genesis of complexity in a supposedly deterministic world,\na theoretical framework covering the evolutionary development of structural\ntransformations in the time evolution of that world is built up.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2009 15:09:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2010 14:07:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 27 Jul 2010 12:04:48 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2011 15:03:11 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 9 May 2012 15:14:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-26"}

At large scales (astrophysical and cosmological scales) the\nattempts to match it with the today observational data lead to invoke Dark\nEnergy and Dark Matter as the bulk components of the cosmic fluid. Since no\nfinal evidence, at fundamental level, exists for such ingredients, it is clear\nthat General Relativity presents shortcomings at infrared scales. On the other\nhand, the attempts to formulate theories more general than the Einstein one\ngive rise to mathematical difficulties that need workarounds which, in turn,\ngenerate problems from the interpretative viewpoint. We present here a\ncompletely new approach to the mathematical objects in terms of which a theory\nof Gravitation may be written in a first-order `a la Palatini formalism, and\nintroduce the concept of Dark Metric which could completely bypass the\nintroduction of disturbing concepts as Dark Energy and Dark Matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2009 15:18:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

A Monte Carlo algorithm that performs importance\nsampling using a simple random resampling step is proposed as a general-purpose\nnumerical method which is both efficient and easy to implement. Alternative\ntechniques complementing this method are presented. These include the\ncomputation of the generalised Lyapunov exponents by solving numerically an\neigenvalue problem, and some asymptotic results corresponding to high-order\nmoments of the matrix products. Taken together, the techniques discussed in\nthis paper provide a suite of methods which should prove useful for the\nevaluation of the generalised Lyapunov exponents in a broad range of\napplications. Their usefulness is demonstrated on particular products of random\nmatrices arising in the study of scalar mixing by complex fluid flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2009 15:38:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2010 19:59:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2011 15:35:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-22"}
