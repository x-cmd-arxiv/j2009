The model describes a partially ionized magnetofluid OH that\ncouples a neutral hydrogen fluid with a plasma primarily through\ncharge-exchange interactions. Charge-exchange interactions are ubiquitous in\nwarm heliospheric plasma, and the strength of the interaction depends largely\non the relative speed between the plasma and the neutral fluid. Unlike\nsmall-length scale linear collisional dissipation in a single fluid,\ncharge-exchange processes introduce channels that can be effective on a variety\nof length scales that depend on the neutral and plasma densities, temperature,\nrelative velocities, charge-exchange cross section, and the characteristic\nlength scales. We find, from scaling arguments and nonlinear coupled fluid\nsimulations, that charge-exchange interactions modify spectral transfer\nassociated with large-scale energy-containing eddies. Consequently, the\nturbulent cascade rate prolongs spectral transfer among inertial range\nturbulent modes. Turbulent spectra associated with the neutral and plasma\nfluids are therefore steeper than those predicted by Kolmogorov's\nphenomenology. Our work is important in the context of the global heliospheric\ninteraction, the energization and transport of cosmic rays, gamma-ray bursts,\ninterstellar density spectra, etc. Furthermore, the plasma-neutral coupling is\ncrucial in understanding the energy dissipation mechanism in molecular clouds\nand star formation processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2009 18:06:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The ionised gas emission is most extended\nalong the known ionisation bi-cone at position angle PA=60-240deg, but is\nobserved also along its equatorial plane. This indicates that the AGN ionizes\ngas beyond the borders of the bi-cone, within a sphere with 1arcsec radius\naround the nucleus. The ionised gas has three kinematic components: (1) one\nobserved at the systemic velocity and interpreted as originating in the galaxy\ndisk; (2) one outflowing along the bi-cone, with line-of-sight velocities\nbetween -600 and 600 km/s and strongest emission at +/-(100-300)km/s; (3) and\nanother component due to the interaction of the radio jet with ambient gas. The\nmass outflow rate, estimated to be 1 M_Sun/yr along each cone, exceeds the\ninferred black hole accretion rate by a factor of 100. There is no evidence in\nour data for the gradual acceleration followed by gradual deceleration proposed\nby previous modelling of the [OIII] emitting gas. The molecular gas exhiibits\ndistinct kinematics relative to the ionised gas. Its emission arises in\nextended regions approximately perpendicular to the axis of the bi-cone and\nalong the axis of the galaxy's stellar bar, avoiding the innermost ionised\nregions. It does not show an outflowing component, being observed only at\nvelocities very close to systemic, and is thus consistent with an origin in the\ngalaxy plane. This hot molecular gas may only be the tracer of a larger\nreservoir of colder gas which represents the AGN feeding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2009 19:59:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

If a rigorous steady\nstate is assumed, then the system is infinite and is described by a universal\ndistribution function given the self-similar index. The steady logarithmic\npotential case is exceptional and yields the familiar Gaussian for an infinite\nsystem with an inverse-square density profile. We show subsequently that for\ntime-dependent radial self-similar infall, the logarithmic case is accurately\ndescribed by the Fridmann and Polyachenko distribution function. The system in\nthis case is finite but growing. We are able to embed a central mass in the\nuniversal steady distribution only by iteration, except in the case of massless\nparticles. The iteration yields logarithmic corrections to the massless\nparticle case and requires a `renormalization' of the central mass. A central\nspherical mass may be accurately embedded in the Fridmann and Polyachenko\ngrowing distribution however.

Yet, models based on the CDM scenario invariably\nform galaxies with dense spheroidal stellar \"bulges\" and steep central DM\nprofiles, as low angular momentum baryons and DM sink to the center of galaxies\nthrough accretion and repeated mergers. Processes that decrease the central\ndensity of CDM halos have been identified, but have not yet reconciled theory\nwith observations of present day dwarfs. This failure is potentially\ncatastrophic for the CDM model, possibly requiring a different DM particle\ncandidate. This Letter presents new hydrodynamical simulations in a Lambda$CDM\nframework where analogues of dwarf galaxies, bulgeless and with a shallow\ncentral DM profile, are formed. This is achieved by resolving the inhomogeneous\ninterstellar medium, resulting in strong outflows from supernovae explosions\nwhich remove low angular momentum gas. This inhibits the formation of bulges\nand decreases the dark-matter density to less than half within the central\nkiloparsec. Realistic dwarf galaxies are thus shown to be a natural outcome of\ngalaxy formation in the CDM scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2009 23:13:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Measurements of the\nlocation of the inner edge (Rin) can be made using iron emission lines that\narise due to fluorescence of iron in the disk, and these indicate that Rin is\nvery close to the black hole at high and moderate luminosities (near 1% of the\nEddington luminosity, Ledd).

While high-mass blue-sequence E/S0s often\nresemble young merger or interaction remnants likely to fade to the red\nsequence, we focus on blue-sequence E/S0s with lower stellar masses (< a few\n10^10 M_sun), which are characterized by fairly regular morphologies and\nlow-density field environments where fresh gas infall is possible. This\npopulation may provide an evolutionary link between early-type galaxies and\nspirals through disk regrowth. Focusing on atomic gas reservoirs, we present\nnew GBT HI data for 27 E/S0s on both sequences as well as a complete tabulation\nof archival HI data for other galaxies in the Nearby Field Galaxy Survey.\nNormalized to stellar mass, the atomic gas masses for 12 of the 14\nblue-sequence E/S0s range from 0.1 to >1.0. These gas-to-stellar mass ratios\nare comparable to those of spiral and irregular galaxies and have a similar\ndependence on stellar mass. Assuming that the HI is accessible for star\nformation, we find that many of our blue-sequence E/S0s can increase in stellar\nmass by 10-60% in 3 Gyr in both of two limiting scenarios, exponentially\ndeclining star formation and constant star formation. In a constant star\nformation scenario, about half of the blue-sequence E/S0s require fresh gas\ninfall on a timescale of <3 Gyr to avoid exhausting their atomic gas reservoirs\nand evolving to the red sequence. We present evidence that star formation in\nthese galaxies is bursty and likely involves externally triggered gas inflows.\nOur analysis suggests that most blue-sequence E/S0s are indeed capable of\nsubstantial stellar disk growth on relatively short timescales.

We identify quite different dielectric response in\neither case; while InN shows a significant shift in the absorption edge due to\nn-type doping, this is masked for GaN due to efficient cancellation of the\nBurstein-Moss effect by the band gap renormalization. For high doping levels\nthe intraband absorption becomes significant in InN. Furthermore, we observe\nthat the free-carrier plasma contribution to refractive index change becomes\nmore important than both band filling and the band gap renormalization for\nelectron densities above 10$^{19}$~cm$^{-3}$ in GaN, and 10$^{20}$~cm$^{-3}$ in\nInN. As a result of the two different characteristics mentioned above, the\noverall change in the refractive index due to n-type doping is much higher in\nInN compared to GaN, which in the former exceeds 4\\% for a doping of\n10$^{19}$~cm$^{-3}$ at 1.55~$\\mu$m wavelength.

In this paper we solve this\nproblem for complete systems, which are special finite circular splicing\nsystems. We show that a circular language L is generated by a complete system\nif and only if the set Lin(L) of all words corresponding to L is a pure unitary\nlanguage generated by a set closed under the conjugacy relation.

As a direct consequence, we characterize (regular)\ncircular languages generated by complete systems. We can also decide whether\nthe language generated by a complete system is regular. Finally, we point out\nthat complete systems have the same computational power as finite simple\nsystems, an easy type of circular splicing system defined in the literature\nfrom the very beginning, when only one rule is allowed.

Third, we supplement the O(\\alpha)\ncorrections by universal electroweak effects of higher order, such as universal\ntwo-loop contributions from \\Delta\\alpha and \\Delta\\rho, and the leading\ntwo-loop corrections in the high-energy Sudakov regime as well as multi-photon\nradiation off muons in the structure-function approach. Finally, we present\nresults on the complete next-to-leading order electroweak and QCD corrections\nwithin the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2009 09:07:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2010 14:29:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

The\nfocus of Cove is not so much on the software product, but on the fundamental\nconcepts that make quantum computing practical for common developers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2009 05:36:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
