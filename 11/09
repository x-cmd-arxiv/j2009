Most of these\nclusters are confined to a narrow age range centred around 10 Myr because of\nobservational constraints. At this age the cluster light is dominated by\nluminous evolved stars, such as red supergiants, with initial masses of ~13-22\nMsun for which (primordial) binarity is high. In this study we investigate to\nwhat extent the observed excess velocity dispersion is the result of the\norbital motions of binaries. We demonstrate that estimates for the dynamical\nmass of young star clusters, derived from the observed velocity dispersion,\nexceed the photometric mass by up-to a factor of 10 and are consistent with a\nconstant offset in the square of the velocity dispersion. This can be\nreproduced by models of virialised star clusters hosting a massive star\npopulation of which ~25 is in binaries, with typical mass ratios of ~0.6 and\nperiods of ~1000 days.

The mean-square current quadrupole moment associated with\nvorticity fluctuations in high-Reynolds-number turbulence in a differentially\nrotating neutron star is calculated analytically, as are the amplitude and\ndecoherence time of the resulting, stochastic gravitational wave signal. The\ncalculation resolves the subtle question of whether the signal is dominated by\nthe smallest or largest turbulent eddies: for the Kolmogorov-like power\nspectrum observed in superfluid spherical Couette simulations, the wave strain\nis controlled by the largest eddies, and the decoherence time approximately\nequals the maximum eddy turnover time. For a neutron star with spin frequency\n$\\nu_s$ and Rossby number $Ro$, at a distance $d$ from Earth, the\nroot-mean-square wave strain reaches $h_{RMS} \\approx 3\\times 10^{-24} Ro^3\n(\\nu_s / 30 Hz)^3 (d/1 kpc)^{-1}$. A cross-correlation search can detect such a\nsource in principle, because the signal decoheres over the time-scale $\\tau_c\n\\approx 10^{-3} Ro^{-1} (\\nu_s / 30 Hz)^{-1} s$, which is adequately sampled by\nexisting long-baseline interferometers. Hence hydrodynamic turbulence imposes a\nfundamental noise floor on gravitational wave observations of neutron stars,\nalthough its polluting effect may be muted by partial decoherence in the\nhectohertz band, where current continuous-wave searches are concentrated, for\nthe highest frequency (and hence most powerful) sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2009 09:09:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

In particular, $d$-wave correlations decay as $c r^{-3}$ (\"free\nelectron\" behaviour), if separation $r$ exceeds 2-3 lattice constants. However,\nthe Hubbard-I approximation underestimates coefficient $c$ by a factor of about\nthree. We conclude that the Hubbard-I approximation, despite its simplicity and\nartefacts, captures the qualitative behaviour of the two-particle propagator\nfor the Hubbard model, at least for moderate values of $r$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2009 12:35:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Jan 2011 12:26:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-18"}

These properties are direct consequences of momentum and mass\nconservation respectively, and agree with recent X-ray observations of fast\noutflows from AGN. Because the wind is significantly subluminal, it can persist\nlong after the AGN is observed to have become sub--Eddington. The wind creates\na strong cooling shock as it interacts with the interstellar medium of the host\ngalaxy, and this cooling region may be observable in an inverse Compton\ncontinuum and lower--excitation emission lines associated with lower\nvelocities. The shell of matter swept up by the (`momentum--driven') shocked\nwind must propagate beyond the black hole's sphere of influence on a timescale\n$\\la 3\\times 10^5$ yr.

Our aim is to make a survey of clumps around a\nsample of HH objects, and to use the results to make an estimate of the\nclumpiness in molecular clouds. All known cold, dense, and quiescent clumps\nnear HH objects are anomalously strong HCO+ emitters. Our method is, therefore,\nto search for strong HCO+ emission as an indicator of a clump near to an HH\nobject. The searches were made using JCMT and SEST in the HCO+ 3-2 and also\nH13CO+ 1-0 lines, with some additional searches for methanol and sulphur\nmonoxide lines. The sources selected were a sample of 22 HH objects in which no\nprevious HCO+ emission had been detected. We find that half of the HH objects\nhave clumps detected in the HCO+ 3-2 line and that all searches in H13CO$+ 1-0\nlines show evidence of clumpiness. All condensations have narrow linewidths and\nare evidently unaffected dynamically by the HH jet shock. We conclude that the\nmolecular clouds in which these HH objects are found must be highly\nheterogeneous on scales of less than 0.1 pc.

For the quantization, we follow [BHW] (with a\nsimplified approach) and build a star product *_red on M_red from a strongly\ninvariant star product * on M. The new questions which are addressed in this\npaper concern the existence of natural *-involutions on the reduced quantum\nalgebra and the representation theory for such a reduced *-algebra. We assume\nthat * is Hermitian and we show that the choice of a formal series of smooth\ndensities on the embedded coisotropic submanifold C = J^{-1}(0), with some\nequivariance property, defines a *-involution for *_red on the reduced space.\nLooking into the question whether the corresponding *-involution is the complex\nconjugation (which is a *-involution in the Marsden-Weinstein context) yields a\nnew notion of quantized unimodular class.

X-ray spectroscopy, based on XMM-Newton and Swift\ndata, allowed us to model the significant excess in photoelectric absorption\nwith respect to the Galactic value as due to a large column density (about\n6.5E+22 cm^-2) in the GRB host, located at z=4.2.

We first\nderive a rigorous equation of motion for the reference density and,\nsubsequently, simplify this equation on the basis of the Markov approximation.\nThe temperature which appears in the canonical distribution is determined by\nthe requirement that, at each time t, the reference density should correctly\nreproduce the mean excitation energy at given values of the shape parameters.\nThe resulting equation for the \"local\" temperature must be solved together with\nthe equations of motion obtained for the reduced density matrix.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2009 13:24:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-17"}

However, their application in\nsafety-critical domains such as the railways, avionics, and automotive\nindustries requires some form of assurance for the results, as the solvers can\n(and sometimes do) have bugs. Unfortunately, the complexity of modern, highly\noptimized SAT solvers renders impractical the development of direct formal\nproofs of their correctness. This paper presents an alternative approach where\nan untrusted, industrial-strength, SAT solver is plugged into a trusted,\nformally certified, SAT proof checker to provide industrial-strength certified\nSAT solving. The key novelties and characteristics of our approach are (i) that\nthe checker is automatically extracted from the formal development, (ii), that\nthe combined system can be used as a standalone executable program independent\nof any supporting theorem prover, and (iii) that the checker certifies any SAT\nsolver respecting the agreed format for satisfiability and unsatisfiability\nclaims. The core of the system is a certified checker for unsatisfiability\nclaims that is formally designed and verified in Coq. We present its formal\ndesign and outline the correctness proofs.

Our result immediately applies to the k-QSAT problem: For instance\nwe show that any collection of rank 1 projectors with the property that each\nqubit appears in at most $2^k/(e \\cdot k)$ of them, has a joint satisfiable\nstate.\n  We then apply our results to the recently studied model of random k-QSAT.\nRecent works have shown that the satisfiable region extends up to a density of\n1 in the large k limit, where the density is the ratio of projectors to qubits.\nUsing a hybrid approach building on work by Laumann et al. we greatly extend\nthe known satisfiable region for random k-QSAT to a density of\n$\\Omega(2^k/k^2)$. Since our tool allows us to show the existence of joint\nsatisfying states without the need to construct them, we are able to penetrate\ninto regions where the satisfying states are conjectured to be entangled,\navoiding the need to construct them, which has limited previous approaches to\nproduct states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2009 15:07:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-10"}

Whereas much is known about how to define and calculate\ncharge gaps in density-functional theory (DFT), and about the relation between\nthese gaps and derivative discontinuities of the exchange-correlation\nfunctional, much less is know about spin gaps. In this paper we give\ndensity-functional definitions of spin-conserving gaps, spin-flip gaps and the\nspin stiffness in terms of many-body energies and in terms of single-particle\n(Kohn-Sham) energies. Our definitions are as analogous as possible to those\ncommonly made in the charge case, but important differences between spin and\ncharge gaps emerge already on the single-particle level because unlike the\nfundamental charge gap spin gaps involve excited-state energies. Kohn-Sham and\nmany-body spin gaps are predicted to differ, and the difference is related to\nderivative discontinuities that are similar to, but distinct from, those\nusually considered in the case of charge gaps. Both ensemble DFT and\ntime-dependent DFT (TDDFT) can be used to calculate these spin discontinuities\nfrom a suitable functional. We illustrate our findings by evaluating our\ndefinitions for the Lithium atom, for which we calculate spin gaps and spin\ndiscontinuities by making use of near-exact Kohn-Sham eigenvalues and,\nindependently, from the single-pole approximation to TDDFT. The many-body\ncorrections to the Kohn-Sham spin gaps are found to be negative, i.e., single\nparticle calculations tend to overestimate spin gaps while they underestimate\ncharge gaps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2009 15:52:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}
