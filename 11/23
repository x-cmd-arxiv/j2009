It has long been observed that sunspots\nsuppress p-mode amplitude, but its implications on travel times has not been\nfully investigated so far. It has been found in test measurements using a\n'masking' procedure, in which the solar Doppler signal in a localized quiet\nregion of the Sun is artificially suppressed by a spatial function, and using\nnumerical simulations that the amplitude modulations in combination with the\nphase-speed filtering may cause systematic shifts of acoustic travel times. To\nunderstand the properties of this procedure, we derive an analytical expression\nfor the cross-covariance of a signal that has been modulated locally by a\nspatial function that has azimuthal symmetry, and then filtered by a phase\nspeed filter typically used in time-distance helioseismology. Comparing this\nexpression to the Gabor wavelet fitting formula without this effect, we find\nthat there is a shift in the travel times, that is introduced by the amplitude\nmodulation. The analytical model presented in this paper can be useful also for\ninterpretation of travel time measurements for non-uniform distribution of\noscillation amplitude due to observational effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Nov 2009 21:52:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The key\nto this emergence is the proliferation of redundant information throughout the\nenvironment where observers can then intercept it. We study this process for a\npurely decohering interaction when the environment, E, is in a non-ideal (e.g.,\nmixed) initial state. In the case of good decoherence, that is, after the\npointer states have been unambiguously selected, the mutual information between\nthe system, S, and an environment fragment, F, is given solely by F's entropy\nincrease. This demonstrates that the environment's capacity for recording the\nstate of S is directly related to its ability to increase its entropy.\nEnvironments that remain nearly invariant under the interaction with S, either\nbecause they have a large initial entropy or a misaligned initial state,\ntherefore have a diminished ability to acquire information. To elucidate the\nconcept of good decoherence, we show that - when decoherence is not complete -\nthe deviation of the mutual information from F's entropy change is quantified\nby the quantum discord, i.e., the excess mutual information between S and F is\ninformation regarding the initial coherence between pointer states of S. In\naddition to illustrating these results with a single qubit system interacting\nwith a multi-qubit environment, we find scaling relations for the redundancy of\ninformation acquired by the environment that display a universal behavior\nindependent of the initial state of S. Our results demonstrate that Quantum\nDarwinism is robust with respect to non-ideal initial states of the\nenvironment: the environment almost always acquires redundant information about\nthe system but its rate of acquisition can be reduced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Nov 2009 23:02:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2010 11:42:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-15"}

We used Dziembowski's pulsation code to compute nonadiabatic\nfrequencies of radial and nonradial modes. Observation of two radial modes and\nan avoided crossing of dipole modes put strong constraints on the models. A\ntwo-parametric overshooting routine is utilized to determine the efficiency of\nelement mixing in the overshoot layer above the convective core.\n  Results. We find that pulsation models in the post-MS contraction phase\nsuccessfully reproduce the observed frequency range, as well as the frequency\nvalues of all individual radial and nonradial modes. The theoretical\nfrequencies of the mixed modes at 7.79 c/d and 9.58 c/d are in better agreement\nwith the observations if efficient element mixing in a small overshoot layer is\nassumed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2009 08:52:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Using numerical data from a\nthree-dimensional deflagration model for type Ia supernovae, the intermittency\nof the turbulent velocity field and its implications on the probability of a\ndeflagration-to-detonation (DDT) transition are investigated. From structure\nfunctions of the turbulent velocity fluctuations, we determine intermittency\nparameters based on the log-normal and the log-Poisson models.

Following Pan et al., we computed probability density functions for a\nDDT for the different distributions. Assuming that a DDT can occur in the\nstirred flame regime, as proposed by Woosley et al., the log-normal model would\nimply a delayed detonation between 0.7 and 0.8 seconds after the beginning of\nthe deflagration phase for the multi-spot ignition scenario used in the\nsimulation. However, the probability drops to virtually zero if a DDT is\nfurther constrained by the requirement that the turbulent velocity fluctuations\nreach about 500 km/s. Under this condition, delayed detonations are only\npossible if the distribution of the velocity fluctuations is not log-normal.\n  From our calculations follows that the distribution obtained by Roepke allow\nfor multiple DDTs around 0.8 seconds after ignition at a transition density\nclose to 1x10^7 g/cm^3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2009 09:55:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

To explain the deficiency, we discuss PAH\ndestruction by photons assuming that the star has beside its photospheric\nemission also a FUV, an EUV and an X-ray component with fractional luminosity\nof 1%, 0.1% and 0.025%, respectively. As PAH destruction process we consider\nunimolecular dissociation and present a simplified scheme to estimate the\nlocation from the star where the molecules become photo-stable. We find that\nsoft photons with energies below ~20eV dissociate PAHs only up to short\ndistances from the star (r < 1AU); whereas dissociation by hard photons (EUV\nand X-ray) is so efficient that it would destroy all PAHs (from regions in the\ndisk where they could be excited). As a possible path for PAH survival we\nsuggest turbulent motions in the disk. They can replenish PAHs or remove them\nfrom the reach of hard photons. For standard disk models, where the surface\ndensity changes like 1/r and the mid plane temperature like 1/r^{0.5}, the\ncritical vertical velocity for PAH survival is proportional to r^{-3/4} and\nequals ~5m/s at 10AU which is in the range of expected velocities in the\nsurface layer. The uncertainty in the parameters is large enough to explain\nboth detection and non-detection of PAHs. Our approximate treatment also takes\ninto account the presence of gas which, at the top of the disk, is ionized and\nat lower levels neutral.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2009 10:53:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-24"}

The observations cover a range of spatial resolutions between 3 and 12\nmilli-arcseconds, with a spectral resolution of ~30. With a total of 1481\nvisibilities and 432 closure phases, they result in the best (u,v) coverage\nachieved on a young star so far. The circumstellar material is resolved at the\nsub-AU spatial scale and closure phase measurements indicate a small but\nsignificant deviation from point-symmetry. We discuss the results assuming that\nthe near-infrared excess in HD163296 is dominated by the emission of a\ncircumstellar disk. A successful fit to the spectral energy distribution,\nnear-infrared visibilities and closure phases is found with a model where a\ndominant contribution to the H and K band emissions arises from an optically\nthin, smooth and point-symmetric region extending from about 0.1 to 0.45 AU. At\nthe latter distance from the star, silicates condense, the disk becomes\noptically thick and develops a puffed-up rim, whose skewed emission can account\nfor the non-zero closure phases. We discuss the nature of the inner disk\nemission and tentatively rule out dense molecular gas as well as optically thin\natomic or ionized gas as its possible origin. We propose instead that the inner\nemission traces the presence of very refractory grains in a partially cleared\nregion, extending at least to 0.5 AU. If so, we may be observing the disk of\nHD163296 just before it reaches the transition disk phase. However, we note\nthat the nature of the refractory grains or even the possibility for any grain\nto survive at the very high temperatures we require (~2100-2300 K at 0.1 AU\nfrom the star) is unclear and should be investigated further.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2009 11:09:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2009 10:25:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Just one\nHalo star had been detected in CO before this work. Infrared observations show\nthat these stars are red (J-K $>$3), due to the presence of large dusty\ncircumstellar envelopes. Radiative transfer models indicates that these stars\nare losing mass with rather large dust mass-loss rates in the range 1--3.3\n$\\times$$10^{-8}$M$_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, similar to what can be observed in the\nGalactic disc.

The wind\nexpansion velocities of the observed stars are low compared to carbon stars in\nthe thin disc and are lower for the stars in the Halo and the Sgr dSph stream\nthan in the thick disc. We discuss the possibility that the low expansion\nvelocities result from the low metallicity of the Halo carbon stars. This\nimplies that metal-poor carbon stars lose mass at a rate similar to metal-rich\ncarbon stars, but with lower expansion velocities, as predicted by recent\ntheoretical models. This result implies that the current estimates of mass-loss\nrates from carbon stars in Local Group galaxies will have to be reconsidered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2009 11:43:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-21"}

Most studies in collective\nanimal behaviour have aimed to understand how a globally ordered state may\nemerge from simple behavioural rules. Less effort has been devoted to\nunderstanding the origin of collective response, namely the way the group as a\nwhole reacts to its environment. Yet collective response is the adaptive key to\nsurvivor, especially when strong predatory pressure is present. Here we argue\nthat collective response in animal groups is achieved through scale-free\nbehavioural correlations. By reconstructing the three-dimensional position and\nvelocity of individual birds in large flocks of starlings, we measured to what\nextent the velocity fluctuations of different birds are correlated to each\nother. We found that the range of such spatial correlation does not have a\nconstant value, but it scales with the linear size of the flock. This result\nindicates that behavioural correlations are scale-free: the change in the\nbehavioural state of one animal affects and is affected by that of all other\nanimals in the group, no matter how large the group is. Scale-free correlations\nextend maximally the effective perception range of the individuals, thus\ncompensating for the short-range nature of the direct inter-individual\ninteraction and enhancing global response to perturbations. Our results suggest\nthat flocks behave as critical systems, poised to respond maximally to\nenvironmental perturbations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2009 13:00:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-10"}

The model parameters are constrained by comparing its\noutput with observations of the total surface magnetic flux and with a\nreconstruction of the open magnetic flux based on the geomagnetic indexes. A\nmethod to compute the Sun's total magnetic flux and the sunspot number during\nthe Holocene, starting from the open flux obtained from cosmogenic isotopes\nrecords, is also presented. By considering separately a rapdly evolving and a\nslowly evolving component of the open flux the model reproduces the Sun's open\nflux, as reconstructed based on the aa-index, much better and a reasonable\ndescription of the radial component of interplanetary magnetic field data are\nobtained. The greatest improvement is in the reproduction of the cyclic\nvariation of the open flux, including the amplitudes of individual cycles.\nFurthermore, we found that approximately 25% of the modeled open flux values\nsince the end of the Maunder Minimum are lower than the averaged value during\nthe current low minimum. The same proportion is observed in reconstructions of\nthe open flux during the Holocene based on cosmogenic isotopes, which suggests\nthat the present solar minimum conditions are below average, but not\nexceptional in terms of the magnetic flux.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2009 13:17:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-24"}

We aim to explore the photosphere of the very cool late-type star VX\nSgr and in particular the existence and characterization of molecular layers\nabove the continuum forming photosphere. Methods. We obtained interferometric\nobservations with the VLTI/AMBER interferometer using the fringe tracker FINITO\nin the spectral domain 1.45-2.50 micron with a spectral resolution of about 35\nand baselines ranging from 15 to 88 meters.We perform independent image\nreconstruction for different wavelength bins and fit the interferometric data\nwith a geometrical toy model.We also compare the data to 1D dynamical models of\nMiras atmosphere and to 3D hydrodynamical simulations of red supergiant (RSG)\nand asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. Results. Reconstructed images and\nvisibilities show a strong wavelength dependence. The H-band images display two\nbright spots whose positions are confirmed by the geometrical toy model. The\ninhomogeneities are qualitatively predicted by 3D simulations. At about 2,00\nmicron and in the region 2,35 - 2,50 micron, the photosphere appears extended\nand the radius is larger than in the H band. In this spectral region, the\ngeometrical toy model locates a third bright spot outside the photosphere that\ncan be a feature of the molecular layers. The wavelength dependence of the\nvisibility can be qualitatively explained by 1D dynamical models of Mira\natmospheres. The best-fitting photospheric models show a good match with the\nobserved visibilities and give a photospheric diameter of theta = 8,82+-0,50\nmas.

In these models, since\nthe source node also receives signals, its encoder has the option of computing\nits output based on the signals it received in the past. On the other hand,\nfrom a practical point of view, it would also be desirable to identify the\ncases where such an encoder design may not improve communication rates. This\nquestion is particularly interesting for the case where the transmitted\nmessages and the feedback signals are subject to eavesdropping. In this work,\nwe investigate the question of how much impact the feedback has on the secrecy\ncapacity by studying two fundamental models. First, we consider the Gaussian\ntwo-way wiretap channel and derive an outer bound for its secrecy capacity\nregion. We show that the secrecy rate loss can be unbounded when feedback\nsignals are not utilized except for a special case we identify, and thus\nconclude that utilizing feedback can be highly beneficial in general. Second,\nwe consider a half-duplex Gaussian two-way relay channel where the relay node\nis also an eavesdropper, and find that the impact of feedback is less\npronounced compared to the previous scenario. Specifically, the loss in secrecy\nrate, when ignoring the feedback, is quantified to be less than 0.5 bit per\nchannel use when the relay power goes to infinity. This achievable rate region\nis obtained with simple time sharing along with cooperative jamming, which,\nwith its simplicity and near optimum performance, is a viable alternative to an\nencoder that utilizes feedback signals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2009 15:54:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-24"}
