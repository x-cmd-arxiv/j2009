We study a toy model where the flow behind a planar\nstationary accretion shock is adiabatically decelerated by an external\npotential. Two magnetic field geometries are considered: parallel or\nperpendicular to the shock. The entropy-vorticity wave, which is simply\nadvected in the unmagnetized limit, separates into five different waves: the\nentropy perturbations are advected, while the vorticity can propagate along the\nfield lines through two Alfven waves and two slow magnetosonic waves. The two\ncycles existing in the unmagnetized limit, advective-acoustic and purely\nacoustic, are replaced by up to six distinct MHD cycles. The phase differences\namong the cycles play an important role in determining the total cycle\nefficiency and hence the growth rate. Oscillations in the growth rate as a\nfunction of the magnetic field strength are due to this varying phase shift. A\nvertical magnetic field hardly affects the cycle efficiency in the regime of\nsuper-Alfvenic accretion that is considered. In contrast, we find that a\nhorizontal magnetic field strongly increases the efficiencies of the vorticity\ncycles that bend the field lines, resulting in a significant increase of the\ngrowth rate if the different cycles are in phase.

Unlike the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), the stop\nmasses can be very heavy. We then discuss possible CP violation in the Higgs\nsector, which can be both spontaneous and explicit, even at tree level.

However, in an expanding\nuniverse, consistently eliminating one of the \"unphysical\" states in the\ncovariant (Gupta-Bleuler) formalism turns out to be difficult to realize. In\nthis work we explore the possibility of quantization without subsidiary\nconditions. This implies that the theory would contain a third physical state.\nThe presence of such a new (temporal) electromagnetic mode on cosmological\nscales is shown to generate an effective cosmological constant which can\naccount for the accelerated expansion of the universe. This new polarization\nstate is completely decoupled from charged matter, but can be excited\ngravitationally. In fact, primordial electromagnetic quantum fluctuations\nproduced during electroweak scale inflation could naturally explain the\npresence of this mode and also the measured value of the cosmological constant.\nThe theory is compatible with all the local gravity tests, it is free from\nclassical or quantum instabilities and reduces to standard QED in the flat\nspace-time limit. Thus we see that, not only the true nature of dark energy can\nbe established without resorting to new physics, but also the value of the\ncosmological constant finds a natural explanation in the context of standard\ninflationary cosmology.

The approach is based on an\neffective Lagrangian which generates exchanges of scalar, pseudoscalar,\naxial-vector and tensor mesons. The specific role of mesons with different\nvalues for J(PC) is analyzed. We show that the pi(0) exchange amplitude and its\ninterference terms with eta(eta') and f1 exchanges dominate in the transverse\npart of the cross section sigmaT. The main role plays the pi(0) to rho(0) M1\nspin transition when coupling the virtual photons to the nucleon. In contrast,\nthe longitudinal cross section sigmaL is generated by a series of scalar meson\nexchanges.

We suggest\nthat the sectored heliospheric magnetic field, which results from the flapping\nof the heliospheric current sheet, piles up as it approaches the heliopause,\nnarrowing the current sheets that separate the sectors and triggering the onset\nof collisionless magnetic reconnection. Particle-in-cell simulations reveal\nthat most of the magnetic energy is released and most of this energy goes into\nenergetic ions with significant but smaller amounts of energy going into\nelectrons. The energy gain of the most energetic ions results from their\nreflection from the ends of contracting magnetic islands, a first order Fermi\nprocess. The energy gain of the ions in contracting islands increases their\nparallel (to the magnetic field ${\\bf B}$) pressure $p_\\parallel$ until the\nmarginal firehose condition is reached, causing magnetic reconnection and\nassociated particle acceleration to shut down. The model calls into question\nthe strong scattering assumption used to derive the Parker transport equation\nand therefore the absence of first order Fermi acceleration in incompressible\nflows. A simple 1-D model for particle energy gain and loss is presented in\nwhich the feedback of the energetic particles on the reconnection drive is\nincluded. The ACR differential energy spectrum takes the form of a power law\nwith a spectral index slightly above 1.5. The model has the potential to\nexplain several key Voyager observations, including the similarities in the\nspectra of different ion species.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2009 18:06:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The challenges in extracting this information must be overcome\nto make the most of a large experimental effort. Even after having converged to\na standard cosmological model (the LCDM model) we should keep in mind that this\nmodel is described by 10 or more physical parameters and if we want to study\ndeviations from it, the number of parameters is even larger.

If a stream\nof gas penetrates through it, a small-scale gravitational field created by the\nclumps disturbs the flow resulting in momentum exchange between the stream and\nthe dark matter. In this article, we perform an analysis of this effect, based\non the hierarchial halo model of the dark matter structure and\nNavarro-Frenk-White density profiles. We consider the clumps of various masses,\nfrom the smallest up to the highest ones $M\\ge 10^{9} M_\\odot$. It has been\nfound that in any event the effect grows with the mass of the clump: not only\nthe drag force $\\mathfrak F$ acting on the clump, but also its acceleration\n$w=\\mathfrak F/M$ increases.\n  We discuss various astrophysical systems. The mechanism proved to be\nineffective in the case of galaxy or galaxy cluster collisions. On the other\nhand, it played an important role during the process of galaxy formation. As a\nresult, the dark matter should have formed a more compact, oblate, and faster\nrotating substructure in the halo of our Galaxy. We have shown that this thick\ndisk should be more clumpy than the halo. This fact is very important for the\nindirect detection experiments since it is the clumps that give the main\ncontribution to the annihilation signal. Our calculations show that the\nmechanism of momentum exchange between the dark and baryon matter is\nineffective on the outskirts of the galactic halo.

Four combined catalogues have been\ncalculated: Two first of them provide a stochastic improvement of the ICRF, and\nlast two of them allow us to account also for systematic errors in the current\nICRF version.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2009 20:14:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-12"}

Similarly to standard semi-analytical\nmodels we trace galaxies inside dark-matter merger-trees. The formalism\nincludes treatment of feedback, star-formation, cooling, smooth accretion, gas\nstripping in satellite galaxies, and merger-induced star bursts. However,\nunlike in other models, each process is assumed to have an efficiency which\ndepends only on the host halo mass and redshift. This allows us to describe the\nvarious components of the model in a simple and transparent way. By allowing\nthe efficiencies to have any value for a given halo mass and redshift, we can\neasily encompass a large range of scenarios. To demonstrate this point, we\nexamine several different galaxy formation models, which are all consistent\nwith the observational data. Each model is characterized by a different unique\nfeature: cold accretion in low mass haloes, zero feedback, stars formed only in\nmerger-induced bursts, and shutdown of star-formation after mergers. Using\nthese models we are able to examine the degeneracy inherent in galaxy formation\nmodels, and look for observational data that will help to break this\ndegeneracy. We show that the full distribution of star-formation rates in a\ngiven stellar mass bin is promising in constraining the models. We compare our\napproach in detail to the semi-analytical model of De Lucia & Blaizot. It is\nshown that our formalism is able to produce a very similar population of\ngalaxies once the same median efficiencies per halo mass and redshift are being\nused.

We\ndescribe a method for measuring high-precision relative radial velocities of\nthese stars from K-band spectra. The method makes use of a glass cell filled\nwith ammonia gas to calibrate the spectrograph response similar to the \"iodine\ncell\" technique that has been used very successfully in the visible. Stellar\nspectra are obtained through the ammonia cell and modeled as the product of a\nDoppler-shifted template spectrum of the object and a spectrum of the cell,\nconvolved with a variable instrumental profile model. A complicating factor is\nthat a significant number of telluric absorption lines are present in the\nspectral regions containing useful stellar and ammonia lines. The telluric\nlines are modeled simultaneously as well using spectrum synthesis with a\ntime-resolved model of the atmosphere over the observatory. The free parameters\nin the complete model are the wavelength scale of the spectrum, the\ninstrumental profile, adjustments to the water and methane abundances in the\natmospheric model, telluric spectrum Doppler shift, and stellar Doppler shift.\nTests of the method based on the analysis of hundreds of spectra obtained for\nlate M dwarfs over six months demonstrate that precisions of ~5 m/s are\nobtainable over long timescales, and precisions of better than 3 m/s can be\nobtained over timescales up to a week.

This paper\nreports on the first study of Mrk841 soft X-ray spectrum at high spectral\nresolution. The availability of multiple exposures obtained by the Reflection\nGrating Spectrometer (RGS) cameras allows a thorough study of the complex\nabsorption and emission spectral features in the soft X-ray band.The three\ncombined exposures obtained in January 2001 and the two obtained in January and\nJuly 2005 were analysed using the SPEX software. We detect a two-phase warm\nabsorber: a medium ionisation component (logxi~1.5-2.2 ergs s cm^{-1}) is\nresponsible for a deep absorption feature in the Unresolved Transition Array of\nthe Fe M-shell and for several absorption lines in the OVI-VIII band; a higher\nionisation phase with logxi~3 ergs s cm^{-1} is required to fit absorption in\nthe NeIX-X band.

We\ninvestigate quantitatively the impact of such modelling inaccuracies on the\nsignificance of star formation history reconstructions obtained from optical\nintegrated spectra. To do so, we analyse the sample of spectra of galactic\nglobular clusters of Schiavon et al. with STECKMAP (Ocvirk et al.) and the\nstellar population models Vazdekis et al. and Bruzual & Charlot, and focus on\nthe reconstructed stellar age distributions. Firstly, we show that\nbackground/foreground contamination correlates with E(B-V), which allows us to\ndefine a clean subsample of uncontaminated GCs, on the basis of a E(B-V)\nfiltering.\n  We then identify a \"confusion zone\" where fake young bursts of star formation\npop up in the star formation history although the observed population is\ngenuinely old. These artifacts appear for 70-100% of cases depending on the\npopulation model used, and contribute up to 12% of the light in the optical.\nTheir correlation with the horizontal branch ratio indicates that the confusion\nis driven by HB morphology: red horizontal branch clusters are well fitted by\nold stellar population models while those with a blue HB require an additional\nhot component. The confusion zone extends over [Fe/H]=[-2,-1.2], although we\nlack the data to probe extreme high and low metallicity regimes. As a\nconsequence, any young starburst superimposed on an old stellar population in\nthis metallicity range could be regarded as a modeling artifact, if it weighs\nless than 12% of the optical light, and if no emission lines typical of an HII\nregion are present.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2009 21:03:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

These numbers are\nobtained using a density-estimation procedure that finds the frequencies of\nvarious values of local density within a simulated ring patch.\n  Application of our parameterization to a suite of N-body simulations implies\nthat the distribution of local optical depths is trimodal, rather than bimodal\nas previous authors have assumed. Rings dominated by self-gravity wakes appear\nto be mostly empty space.\n  The implications of this result for the analysis of occultation data are more\nconceptual than practical. The only adjustment needed is that the model\nparameter $\\tau_{gap}$ should be interpreted as representing the area-weighted\naverage optical depth within the gaps (or inter-wake regions).\n  The most significant consequence of our results applies to the question of\nwhy \"propeller\" structures observed in the mid-A ring are seen as\nrelative-bright features, even though the most prominent features of simulated\npropellers are regions of relatively low density. We find preliminary\nquantitative support for the hypothesis that propellers would be bright if they\ninvolve a local and temporary disruption of self-gravity wakes, flooding the\nregion with more \"photometrically active\" material (i.e., material that can\ncontribute to the rings' local optical depth) even though the overall density\nis lower, and thus raising their apparent brightnesses in agreement with\nobservations.

This new phase\nis stable between 19 and 89 GPa, can be quenched to ambient conditions, and has\na hitherto unknown structure (space group Pnnm, 28 atoms in the unit cell)\nconsisting of icosahedral B12 clusters and B2 pairs in a NaCl-type arrangement.\nWe find that the ionicity of the phase affects its electronic bandgap, infrared\nadsorption and dielectric constants, and that it arises from the different\nelectronic properties of the B2 pairs and B12 clusters and the resultant charge\ntransfer between them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2009 00:58:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2009 13:31:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-16"}

We first present a\nfast sublinear time distributed algorithm for performing random walks whose\ntime complexity is sublinear in the length of the walk. Our algorithm performs\na random walk of length $\\ell$ in $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{\\ell D})$ rounds (with high\nprobability) on an undirected network, where $D$ is the diameter of the\nnetwork. This improves over the previous best algorithm that ran in\n$\\tilde{O}(\\ell^{2/3}D^{1/3})$ rounds (Das Sarma et al., PODC 2009).

Unanticipated results driving this\ndevelopment include the fact that while for generic Chu spaces monics consist\nof an injective first and a surjective second component, in the extensional and\nbiextensional cases the surjectivity requirement can be dropped. Furthermore,\nthe desired colimits are only guaranteed to exist in the extensional case.\nFinally, not all finite Chu spaces (considered set-theoretically) are finite\nobjects in their categories. This study opens up opportunities for further\ninvestigations into recursively defined Chu spaces, as well as constructive\nmodels of linear logic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2009 06:27:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2010 23:45:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-01"}

Then most algorithmic approaches\nrely on the structure of these configurations. Such characterisations are said\ninternal. In order to apply algorithms detecting a structural property (like\nidentifying connected components) one may have first to transform the system in\norder to fit the description needed for the algorithm. The problem of internal\ncharacterisation is that it hides structural properties, and each solution\nbecomes ad hoc relatively to the form of the configurations.\n  On the contrary, external characterisations avoid explicit naming of the\nvertices.

However, these models have not yet been\nbroadly accepted. This fact is mainly due to its inherent complexity. In\nparticular, not only for being extremely complex information processing models,\nbut also because of a computational expensive learning phase. The most popular\ntraining method for these models is back-propagation through the structure.\nThis algorithm has been revealed not to be the most appropriate for structured\nprocessing due to problems of convergence, while more sophisticated training\nmethods enhance the speed of convergence at the expense of increasing\nsignificantly the computational cost. In this paper, we firstly perform an\nanalysis of the underlying principles behind these models aimed at\nunderstanding their computational power. Secondly, we propose an approximate\nsecond order stochastic learning algorithm. The proposed algorithm dynamically\nadapts the learning rate throughout the training phase of the network without\nincurring excessively expensive computational effort. The algorithm operates in\nboth on-line and batch modes. Furthermore, the resulting learning scheme is\nrobust against the vanishing gradients problem. The advantages of the proposed\nalgorithm are demonstrated with a real-world application example.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2009 13:17:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-18"}

In the mesogranulation range and up to a scale of\n25Mm, we find that the vertical velocity field amplitude decreases like\nL^{-3/2} with the horizontal scale L. This behaviour corresponds to a k^2\nspectral power law. Still in the mesoscale range, [2.5, 10]Mm, we find that\nintensity fluctuations in the blue continuum follow a power law in k^2. We show\nthat granule tracking cannot sample scales below 2.5Mm. We locate the\nsupergranulation energy peak around 30Mm and show that the emergence of a pore\nerases this spectral peak. Thanks to a scale height estimate, we find that\nsupergranular flows are shallow.

A description is\ngiven of the analysis methods developed to account for the highly-textured\nnature of the samples. The DFT calculations are shown to provide a good\ndescription of the general features of the experimental data. This is\nsignificant in light of a number of striking disagreements in the literature\nbetween other experiments and DFT on CaC$_6$. The results presented here\ndemonstrate that the disagreements are not due to any large inaccuracies in the\ncalculated phonon frequencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2009 15:44:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2010 17:28:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-25"}

The LLP may\npenetrate the atmosphere and decay into a pair of muons near/in the neutrino\ntelescope. Such muons can be treated as the detectable signal for neutrino\ntelescope. This study is motivated by recent cosmic electron/positron\nobservations which suggest the existence of $O(TeV)$ dark matter and new light\n$O(GeV)$ particle. It indicates that dark sector may be complicated, and there\nmay exist more than one light particles, for example the dark gauge boson $A'$\nand associated dark Higgs boson $h'$. In this work, we discuss the scenario\nwith $A'$ heavier than $h'$ and $h'$ is treated as LLP. Based on our numerical\nestimation, we find that the large volume neutrino telescope IceCube has the\ncapacity to observe several tens of di-muon events for favorable parameters if\nthe decay length of LLP can be comparable with the depth of atmosphere. The\nchallenge here is how to suppress the muon backgrounds induced by cosmic rays\nand atmospheric neutrinos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2009 15:57:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 Feb 2010 00:53:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

It has been shown also that inclusion of the\nGauss-Bonnet term in the bulk action modifies this picture via curvature\neffects. Here, based on the Lue-Starkman conjecture on the dynamical screening\nof the brane cosmological constant in the DGP setup, we extend this proposal to\na general DGP-inspired $f(R,\\phi)$ model that stringy effects in the\nultra-violet sector of the theory are taken into account by inclusion of the\nGauss-Bonnet term in the bulk action. We study cosmological dynamics of this\nsetup, especially its phantom-like behavior and possible crossing of the\nphantom divide line especially with a non-minimally coupled quintessence field\non the brane.

While the maximum occurs at some finite value of a\nparameter for $p \\leq 4$, it occurs at infinity of the parameter for $p=5$. As\na consequence, for fixed charge, there are two black D$p$-branes (for $p\\leq\n4$) at any given temperature less than its maximum value, and when the\ntemperature is maximum there is one black D$p$-brane. For $p=5$, there is only\none black D5-brane at a given temperature less than its maximum value, whereas,\nfor $p=6$, since there is no bound for the temperature, there is always a black\nD6-brane solution at a given temperature. Of the two black D$p$-branes (for\n$p\\leq 4$), one is large which is shown to be thermodynamically unstable and\nthe other is small which is stable. But for $p=5,6$, the black D$p$-branes are\nalways thermodynamically unstable. The stable, small black D$p$-brane, however,\nunder certain conditions, can become unstable quantum mechanically and decay\neither to a BPS D$p$-brane or to a Kaluza-Klein \"bubble of nothing\" through\nclosed string tachyon condensation. The small D5, D6 branes, although\nclassically unstable, have the same fate under similar conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2009 15:52:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 Nov 2009 17:34:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2010 01:15:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}
