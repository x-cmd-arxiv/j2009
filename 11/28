Many proposals have been put forth to\nexplain these data, usually relying on a single particle to annihilate or decay\nto produce e+e-. In this paper, we consider models with multiple species of\nWIMPs with significantly different masses. We show if such dark matter\ncandidates chi_i annihilate into light bosons, they naturally produce equal\nannihilation rates, even as the available numbers of pairs for annihilation\nn_chi_i^2 differ by orders of magnitude. We argue that a consequence of these\nmodels can be to add additional signal naturally at lower (~100 GeV) versus\nhigher (~ TeV) energies, changing the expected spectrum and even adding bumps\nat lower energies, which may alleviate some of the tension in the required\nannihilation rates between PAMELA and Fermi. These spectral changes may yield\nobservable consequences in the microwave Haze signal observed at the upcoming\nPlanck satellite. Such a model can connect to other observable signals such as\nDAMA and INTEGRAL by having the lighter (heavier) state be a pseudo-Dirac\nfermion with splitting 100 keV (1 MeV). We show that variations in the halo\nvelocity dispersion can alleviate constraints from final state radiation in the\ngalactic center and galactic ridge. If the lighter WIMP has a large\nself-interaction cross section, the light-WIMP halo might collapse,\ndramatically altering expectations for direct and indirect detection\nsignatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2009 20:54:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-30"}

While red giants exhibit\nlow surface rotational velocities, we find that the rotational history of the\nstar has a large impact on its properties during the red giant phase. In\nparticular, for stars massive enough to ignite He burning in non-degenerate\nconditions, rotational mixing induces a significant increase of the stellar\nluminosity and shifts the location of the core helium burning phase to a higher\nluminosity in the HR diagram. This of course results in a change of the seismic\nproperties of red giants at the same evolutionary state. As a consequence the\ninclusion of rotation significantly changes the fundamental parameters of a red\ngiant star as determined by performing an asteroseismic calibration. In\nparticular rotation decreases the derived stellar mass and increases the age.\nDepending on the rotation law assumed in the convective envelope and on the\ninitial velocity of the star, non-negligible values of rotational splitting can\nbe reached, which may complicate the observation and identification of\nnon-radial oscillation modes for red giants exhibiting moderate surface\nrotational velocities. By comparing the effects of rotation and overshooting,\nwe find that the main-sequence widening and the increase of the H-burning\nlifetime induced by rotation (Vini=150 km/s) are well reproduced by\nnon-rotating models with an overshooting parameter of 0.1, while the increase\nof luminosity during the post-main sequence evolution is better reproduced by\nnon-rotating models with overshooting parameters twice as large. This is due to\nthe fact that rotation not only increases the size of the convective core but\nalso changes the chemical composition of the radiative zone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2009 16:44:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

However, the\nconnection of quasar absorbers to galaxies is not well-understood, since\nattempts to image the absorbing galaxies have often failed. While most DLAs\nappear to be metal-poor, a population of metal-rich absorbers, mostly sub-DLAs,\nhas been discovered in recent studies. Here we report high-resolution K-band\nimaging with the Keck Laser Guide Star Adaptive Optics (LGSAO) system of the\nfield of quasar SDSSJ1323-0021 in search of the galaxy producing the z = 0.72\nsub-DLA absorber. With a metallicity of 2-4 times the solar level, this\nabsorber is of the most metal-rich systems found to date. Our data show a large\nbright galaxy with an angular separation of only 1.25\" from the quasar,\nwell-resolved from the quasar at the high resolution of our data. The galaxy\nhas a magnitude of K = 17.6-17.9, which corresponds to a luminosity of ~ 3-6\nL*. Morphologically, the galaxy is fit with a model with an effective radius,\nenclosing half the total light, of R_e = 4 kpc and a bulge-to-total ratio of\n0.4-1.0, indicating a substantial bulge stellar population. Based on the\nmass-metallicity relation of nearby galaxies, the absorber galaxy appears to\nhave a stellar mass > 10^{11} M_sun. Given the small impact parameter, this\nmassive galaxy appears to be responsible for the metal-rich sub-DLA. The\nabsorber galaxy is consistent with the metallicity-luminosity relation observed\nfor nearby galaxies, but is near the upper end of metallicity. Our study marks\nthe first application of LGSAO for study of structure of galaxies producing\ndistant quasar absorbers. Finally, this study offers the first example of a\nmassive galaxy with a substantial bulge producing a metal-rich absorber.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2009 18:28:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

If one wants to take care of backreaction effects, then a\ntheory of quantum gravity is needed. It is now widely believed that such a\ntheory should be formulated in a non-perturbative and therefore background\nindependent fashion. Hence, it is a priori a puzzle how a background dependent\nQFT on CS should emerge as a semiclassical limit out of a background\nindependent quantum gravity theory. In this article we point out that the\nBorn-Oppenheimer decomposition (BOD) of the Hilbert space is ideally suited in\norder to establish such a link, provided that the Hilbert space representation\nof the gravitational field algebra satisfies an important condition. If the\ncondition is satisfied, then the framework of QFT on CS can be, in a certain\nsense, embedded into a theory of quantum gravity. The unique representation of\nthe holonomy-flux algebra underlying Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) violates that\ncondition. While it is conceivable that the condition on the representation can\nbe relaxed, for convenience in this article we consider a new classical\ngravitational field algebra and a Hilbert space representation of its\nrestriction to an algebraic graph for which the condition is satisfied. An\nimportant question that remains and for which we have only partial answers is\nhow to construct eigenstates of the full gravity-matter Hamiltonian whose BOD\nis confined to a small neighbourhood of a physically interesting vacuum\nspacetime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2009 20:27:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-30"}

Our results can be divided in two main subjects,\nthe environments of galaxies and their relation to the assembly of their host\nhaloes, and the environments of AGN. (i) For the full SDSS sample, we find\nindications that the local galaxy density is the most efficient parameter to\nseparate galaxy populations, but we also find that galaxies at fixed local\ndensity show some remaining variation of their properties as a function of the\ndistance to the nearest cluster of galaxies (in a range of 0 to 10 cluster\nvirial radii). These differences seem to become less significant if the galaxy\nsamples are additionally constrained to be hosted by groups of similar total\nluminosity. (ii) In AGN host galaxies, the morphology-density relation is much\nless noticeable when compared to the behaviour of the full SDSS sample. In\norder to interpret this result we analyse control samples constructed using\ngalaxies with no detected AGN activity with matching distributions of\nredshifts, stellar masses, r-band luminosities, g-r colours, concentrations,\nlocal densities, host group luminosities, and fractions of central and\nsatellite galaxies.

Many novel phenomena appear, such as Shapiro\nsteps in dc cuurent-voltage (IV) characteristics of a Josephson junction under\nmicrowave shining, which can be used as a voltage standard. Inversely, the\nJosephson effects provide a unique way to generate high-frequency\nelectromagnetic (EM) radiation by dc bias voltage. The discovery of cuprate\nhigh-Tc superconductors accelerated the effort to develop novel source of EM\nwaves based on a stack of atomically dense-packed intrinsic Josephson junctions\n(IJJs), since the large superconductivity gap covers the whole terahertz\nfrequency band. Very recently, strong and coherent terahertz radiations have\nbeen successfully generated from a mesa structure of\n$\\rm{Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_{8+\\delta}}$ single crystal which works both as the source\nof energy gain and as the cavity for resonance.

This novel solution of the inductively coupled sine-Gordon equations\ncaptures the important features of experimental observations. The theory\npredicts an optimal radiation power larger than the one available to date by\norders of magnitude, and thus suggests the technological relevance of the\nphenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Nov 2009 04:37:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2010 09:27:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-21"}

The approach is general and\noptionally allows even for statistics obtained by under-sampling the received\nsignal.\n  All performance measures are given as a function of the chip waveform and the\ndelay distribution of the users in the large system limit.

To measure numerically the roughness of an approximation,\nPawlak introduced a quantitative measure of roughness by using the ratio of the\ncardinalities of the lower and upper approximations. Although the roughness\nmeasure is effective, it has the drawback of not being strictly monotonic with\nrespect to the standard ordering on partitions. Recently, some improvements\nhave been made by taking into account the granularity of partitions. In this\npaper, we approach the roughness measure in an axiomatic way. After\naxiomatically defining roughness measure and partition measure, we provide a\nunified construction of roughness measure, called strong Pawlak roughness\nmeasure, and then explore the properties of this measure. We show that the\nimproved roughness measures in the literature are special instances of our\nstrong Pawlak roughness measure and introduce three more strong Pawlak\nroughness measures as well.

Whipple first noted that planetesimal growth by\nparticle agglomeration is strongly influenced by gas drag; there is a\n\"bottleneck\" at the meter scale with such bodies rapidly spiraling into the\ncentral star, whereas much smaller or larger particles do not. Thus, successful\nplanetary accretion requires rapid planetesimal growth to km scale. A commonly\naccepted picture is that for collisional velocities $V_c$ above a certain\nthreshold collisional velocity, ${V_{th}} \\sim$ 0.1-10 cm s$^{-1}$, particle\nagglomeration is not possible; elastic rebound overcomes attractive surface and\nintermolecular forces. However, if perfect sticking is assumed for all\ncollisions the bottleneck can be overcome by rapid planetesimal growth. While\nprevious work has dealt explicitly with the influences of collisional pressures\nand the possibility of particle fracture or penetration, the basic role of the\nphase behavior of matter--phase diagrams, amorphs and polymorphs--has been\nneglected. Here it is demonstrated that novel aspects of surface phase\ntransitions provide a physical basis for efficient sticking through collisional\nmelting or amphorph-/polymorphization and fusion to extend the collisional\nvelocity range of primary accretion to $\\Delta V_c \\sim$ 1-100 m s$^{-1}$,\nwhich bound both turbulent RMS speeds and the velocity differences between\nboulder sized and small grains $\\sim$ 1-50 m s$^{-1}$. Thus, as inspiraling\nmeter sized bodies collide with smaller particles in this high velocity\ncollisional fusion regime they grow rapidly to km scales and hence settle into\nstable Keplerian orbits in $\\sim$ 10$^5$ years before photoevaporative wind\nclears the disk of source material.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Nov 2009 13:52:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 20 Mar 2010 14:03:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 13 Jun 2010 16:06:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

The claim that GTR is \"already\nparametrized\" suggests analyzing substantive general covariance as formal\ngeneral covariance achieved without hiding preferred coordinates as scalar\n\"clock fields,\" much as Einstein construed general covariance as the lack of\npreferred coordinates. Physicists often install gauge symmetries artificially\nwith additional fields, as in the transition from Proca's to Stueckelberg's\nelectromagnetism. Some post-positivist philosophers, due to realist sympathies,\nare committed to judging Stueckelberg's electromagnetism distinct from and\ninferior to Proca's. By contrast, physicists identify them, the differences\nbeing gauge-dependent and hence unreal. It is often useful to install gauge\nfreedom in theories with broken gauge symmetries (second-class constraints)\nusing a modified Batalin-Fradkin-Tyutin (BFT) procedure. Massive GTR, for which\nparametrization and a Lagrangian BFT-like procedure appear to coincide, mimics\nGTR's general covariance apart from telltale clock fields. A generalized\nprocedure for installing artificial gauge freedom subsumes parametrization and\nBFT, while being more Lagrangian-friendly than BFT, leaving any primary\nconstraints unchanged and using a non-BFT boundary condition. Artificial gauge\nfreedom licenses a generalized Kretschmann objection. However, features of\nparadigm cases of artificial gauge freedom might help to demonstrate a\nprincipled distinction between substantive and merely formal gauge symmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Nov 2009 15:03:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-01"}
