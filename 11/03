We show that the distribution of\ndark-matter halos is naturally described by a multivariate bias scheme where\nthe halo overdensity depends not only on the underlying matter density\nfluctuation delta, but also on the Gaussian part of the primordial\ngravitational potential phi. This corresponds to a non-local bias scheme in\nterms of delta only. We derive the coefficients of the bias expansion as a\nfunction of the halo mass by applying the peak-background split to common\nparametrizations for the halo mass function in the non-Gaussian scenario. We\nthen compute the halo power spectrum and halo-matter cross spectrum in the\nframework of Eulerian perturbation theory up to third order. Comparing our\nresults against N-body simulations, we find that our model accurately describes\nthe numerical data for wavenumbers k < 0.1-0.3 h/Mpc depending on redshift and\nhalo mass. In our multivariate approach, perturbations in the halo counts trace\nphi on large scales and this explains why the halo and matter power spectra\nshow different asymptotic trends for k -> 0. This strongly scale-dependent bias\noriginates from terms at leading order in our expansion. This is different from\nwhat happens using the standard univariate local bias where the scale-dependent\nterms come from badly behaved higher-order corrections. On the other hand, our\nbiasing scheme reduces to the usual local bias on smaller scales where |phi| is\ntypically much smaller than the density perturbations. We finally discuss the\nhalo bispectrum in the context of multivariate biasing and show that, due to\nits strong scale and shape dependence, it is a powerful tool for the detection\nof primordial non-Gaussianity from future galaxy surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2009 20:03:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 2010 22:06:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-14"}

The number of submissions is actually higher, as\neach manuscript is often reviewed several times before publication. To face the\ndeluge of submissions, top journals reject a considerable fraction of\nmanuscripts without review, potentially declining manuscripts with merit. The\nsituation is frustrating for authors, reviewers and editors alike. Recently,\nseveral editors wrote about the ``tragedy of the reviewer commons', advocating\nfor urgent corrections to the system. Almost every scientist has ideas on how\nto improve the system, but it is very difficult, if not impossible, to perform\nexperiments to test which measures would be most effective. Surprisingly,\nrelatively few attempts have been made to model peer review. Here I implement a\nsimulation framework in which ideas on peer review can be quantitatively\ntested. I incorporate authors, reviewers, manuscripts and journals into an\nagent-based model and a peer review system emerges from their interactions. As\na proof-of-concept, I contrast an implementation of the current system, in\nwhich authors decide the journal for their submissions, with a system in which\njournals bid on manuscripts for publication. I show that, all other things\nbeing equal, this latter system solves most of the problems currently\nassociated with the peer review process. Manuscripts' evaluation is faster,\nauthors publish more and in better journals, and reviewers' effort is optimally\nutilized. However, more work is required from editors. This modeling framework\ncan be used to test other solutions for peer review, leading the way for an\nimprovement of how science is disseminated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2009 18:49:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-03"}

To test this hypothesis, here we perform swept area\ninterference measurements at 5/2. We observe an alternating pattern of e/4 and\ne/2 period oscillations in resistance. This aperiodic alternation is consistent\nwith proposed non-Abelian properties: the e/4 oscillations occur for encircling\nan even number of localized quasiparticles, e/2 oscillations are expressed when\nencircling an odd number. Aperiodic alternation corresponds to the expected\narea sweep sampling the localized quasiparticles.

A further low\nenergy component is typically needed to model the observed spectra: pure\nblackbody and Comptonisation-modified blackbody radiation by a lower\ntemperature (a few keV) electron plasma were suggested to explain the low\nenergy data. We studied the steady emission of GS 1826-238 by means of broad\nband (X to soft Gamma-rays) measurements obtained by the INTEGRAL observatory\nin 2003 and 2006. The newly developed, up-to-date Comptonisation model CompTB\nis applied for the first time to study effectively the low-hard state\nvariability of a low-luminosity neutron star in a low-mass X-ray binary system.\nWe confirm that the 3-200 keV emission of \\GS is characterised by\nComptonisation of soft seed photons by a hot electron plasma. A single spectral\ncomponent is sufficient to model the observed spectra. At lower energies, no\ndirect blackbody emission is observed and there is no need to postulate a low\ntemperature Compton region. Compared to the 2003 measurements, the plasma\ntemperature decreased from 20 to 14 keV in 2006, together with the seed photons\ntemperature. The source intensity was also found to be 30% lower in 2006,\nwhilst the average recurrence frequency of the X-ray bursts significantly\nincreased.

Initial-boundary value problems\nfor viscoelastic diffusion equations have been studied by several authors. Most\nof the studies are devoted to the Dirichlet BVP (the concentration is given on\nthe boundary of the domain). In this chapter we study the second BVP, i.e. when\nthe normal component of the concentration flux is prescribed on the boundary,\nwhich is more realistic in many physical situations. We establish existence of\nweak solutions to this problem. We suggest some conditions on the coefficients\nand boundary data under which all the solutions tend to the homogeneous state\nas time goes to infinity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2009 18:07:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-10"}

We have obtained new XMM-Newton observations of seven\nX-ray selected groups and poor clusters with 0.02 < z < 0.06 for comparison\nwith previous samples that mostly included rich clusters and optically-selected\ngroups. Our final sample has ten groups and six clusters in this low-redshift\nrange (split at a velocity dispersion of $\\sigma = 500$ km/s). We find that the\nX-ray selected AGN fraction increases from $f_A(L_X>10^{41}; M_R<M_R^*+1) =\n0.047^{+0.023}_{-0.016}$ in clusters to $0.091^{+0.049}_{-0.034}$ for the\ngroups (85% significance), or a factor of two, for AGN above an 0.3-8keV X-ray\nluminosity of $10^{41}$ erg/s hosted by galaxies more luminous than $M_R^*+1$.\nThe trend is similar, although less significant, for a lower-luminosity host\nthreshold of $M_R = -20$ mag. For many of the groups in the sample we have also\nidentified AGN via standard emission-line diagnostics and find that these AGN\nare nearly disjoint from the X-ray selected AGN.

It is not possible\nto find a common dark halo which reproduces simultaneously the properties of\nboth subpopulations.

We argue in favour of a scenario in which\nthe majority of the blue cluster population has been accreted during the\nassembly of the Fornax cluster. The red cluster population shares the dynamical\nhistory of the galaxy itself. Therefore we recommend to use a dark halo based\non the red GCs alone.

The method is an extension of that proposed by Tormen et\nal. (2004) and Giocoli et al. (2008a), which identifies a subhalo as a group of\nself-bound particles that prior to being accreted by the main progenitor of the\nhost halo belonged to one and the same progenitor halo (hereafter satellite).\nHowever, this definition does not account for the fact that these satellite\nhaloes themselves may also have substructure, which thus gives rise to\nsub-subhaloes, etc. Our new algorithm identifies substructures at all levels of\nthis hierarchy, and we use it to determine the mass function of all\nsubstructure (counting sub-haloes, sub-subhaloes, etc.). On average, haloes\nwhich formed more recently tend to have a larger mass fraction in substructure\nand to be less concentrated than average haloes of the same mass. We provide\nquantitative fits to these correlations. Even though our algorithm is very\ndifferent from that of Gao et al. (2004), we too find that the subhalo mass\nfunction per unit mass at redshift z = 0 is universal. This universality\nextends to any redshift only if one accounts for the fact that host haloes of a\ngiven mass are less concentrated at higher redshifts, and concentration and\nsubstructure abundance are anti-correlated. This universality allows a simple\nparametrization of the subhalo mass function integrated over all host halo\nmasses, at any given time. We provide analytic fits to this function which\nshould be useful in halo model analyses which equate galaxies with halo\nsubstructure when interpreting clustering in large sky surveys. Finally, we\ndiscuss systematic differences in the subhalo mass function that arise from\ndifferent definitions of (host) halo mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2009 21:13:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2010 10:10:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

In addition, we find that nebular line emission is significant in\nmany commonly used broad-band HST filters including the F814W I-band, the F555W\nV-band and the F435W B-band. Two young massive clusters (YMCs) in NGC 4449 were\ntargeted for spectroscopic observations after Reines et al.

One particular set of backgrounds is due to neutrino production of\nmesons, particularly pions, from nucleon or nuclear targets. It is especially\nimportant and theoretically interesting in itself to study $coherent$ neutrino\nproduction of pions, i.e. wherein the target does not break up. Preserving the\ntarget requires that the meson produced in the reaction will be charged for\nCharged Current (CC) interactions or neutral for Neutral Current (NC)\ninteractions. Coherent scattering is the weak analog of exclusive neutral meson\nelectroproduction for which considerable progress has been made in\nunderstanding the intermediate energy, small momentum transfer region by\napplying the Generalized Parton Distribution (GPD) phenomenology. The GPD\nperspective will be explained with emphasis on how the understanding gained\nfrom electroproduction of neutral pions can carry over to the neutrino\nprocesses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2009 23:13:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-07"}

Soon -\nif not already - its size will make the latter impractical for use from the\nresearch community, e.g. for protocol testing. Reproducing a smaller size,\nsnapshot of the AS graph is thus important. However, the first step towards\nthis direction is to obtain the ability to faithfully reproduce the full AS\ntopology. The objective of our work, is to create a generator able to\naccurately emulate and reproduce the distinctive properties of the Internet\ngraph. Our approach is based on (a) the identification of the jellyfish-like\nstructure [1] of the Internet and (b) the consideration of the peer-to-peer and\ncustomer-provider relations between ASs. We are the first to exploit the\ndistinctive structure of the Internet graph together with utilizing the\ninformation provided by the AS relationships in order to create a tool with the\naforementioned capabilities. Comparing our generator with the existing ones in\nthe literature, the main difference is found on the fact that our tool does not\ntry to satisfy specific metrics, but tries to remain faithful to the conceptual\nmodel of the Internet structure. In addition, our approach can lead to (i) the\nidentification of important attributes and patterns in the Internet AS\ntopology, as well as, (ii) the extraction of valuable information on the\nvarious relationships between ASs and their effect on the formulation of the\nInternet structure. We implement our graph generator and we evaluate it using\nthe largest and most recent available dataset for the AS topology. Our\nevaluations, clearly show the ability of our tool to capture the structural\nproperties of the Internet topology at the AS level with high accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2009 00:38:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-04"}

By cross-correlating the SDSS DR5 quasar catalog with the\nXMM-Newton archive, we create a sample of 327 quasars with X-ray S/N > 6, where\nboth optical and X-ray spectra are available. This allows alpha_ox to be\ndefined at arbitrary frequencies, rather than the standard 2500 Angstroms and 2\nkeV. We find that while the choice of optical wavelength does not strongly\ninfluence the alpha_ox-l_opt relation, the slope of the relation does depend on\nthe choice of X-ray energy. The slope of the relation becomes steeper when\nalpha_ox is defined at low (~ 1 keV) X-ray energies. This change is significant\nwhen compared to the slope predicted by a decrease in the baseline over which\nalpha_ox is defined. The slopes are also marginally flatter than predicted at\nhigh (~ 10 keV) X-ray energies. Partial correlation tests show that while the\nprimary driver of alpha_ox is l_opt, the Eddington ratio correlates strongly\nwith alpha_ox when l_opt is taken into account, so accretion rate may help\nexplain these results. We combine the alpha_ox-l_opt and Gamma -L_bol/L_Edd\nrelations to naturally explain two results: 1) the existence of the Gamma-l_x\nrelation as reported in Young et al. (2009) and 2) the lack of a Gamma-l_opt\nrelation. The consistency of the optical/X-ray correlations establishes a more\ncomplete framework for understanding the relation between quasar emission\nmechanisms.

Web services are the\ninseparable part of any web application, as a result enhancing performance of\nweb services will have a great effect on the overall performance of the system.\nThe most widely used communication protocol in the web services model, SOAP, is\na simple protocol for the exchange of messages. The serialization of large SOAP\nresponses is a major performance bottleneck in a SOAP message exchange.\nClearly, some web servers can expect to receive many similar messages for a\nparticular web service as they share the same signature. The idea behind this\npaper is to avoid the redundant serialization stage of SOAP responses for\nrequest which have the same call parameters. The technique exploits the\nsimilarities between call parameters to improve web service Response Time by\navoiding redundant serialization of the same response with the help of a\nmiddleware running on top of web server. The middleware will maintain a trie of\nincoming parameters for every set of current requests. This way request\nprocessing and serialization of the response of same requests will be done only\nonce. In a nutshell, to serialize only the different responses is the simplest\nway to avoid extra work done by a serializer. It might worth noting that\nalthough our approach is to utilize the exact repeating portion parameters, the\nmiddleware can be configured to apply changes made to the result set of\nresponse to the serialized response being maintained in a trie to generate\nvalid results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2009 04:28:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-04"}

Fingerprint\nrecognition has been recognized as one of the most mature and established\ntechnique among all the biometrics systems. In recent times, with fingerprint\nrecognition receiving increasingly more attention the amount of fingerprints\ncollected has been constantly creating enormous problems in storage and\ntransmission. Henceforth, the compression of fingerprints has emerged as an\nindispensable step in automated fingerprint recognition systems. Several\nresearchers have presented approaches for fingerprint image compression. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel and efficient scheme for fingerprint image\ncompression. The presented scheme utilizes the Bezier curve representations for\neffective compression of fingerprint images. Initially, the ridges present in\nthe fingerprint image are extracted along with their coordinate values using\nthe approach presented. Subsequently, the control points are determined for all\nthe ridges by visualizing each ridge as a Bezier curve. The control points of\nall the ridges determined are stored and are used to represent the fingerprint\nimage. When needed, the fingerprint image is reconstructed from the stored\ncontrol points using Bezier curves. The quality of the reconstructed\nfingerprint is determined by a formal evaluation. The proposed scheme achieves\nconsiderable memory reduction in storing the fingerprint.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2009 05:11:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-04"}

The archetype is the FU Orionis (FU Ori) outburst, where the\naccretion rate can increase by three orders of magnitude (and the brightness of\nthe system by five magnitudes). The cause appears to be instability in the\ncircumstellar disc, but there is currently some debate as to the nature of this\ninstability (e.g. thermal, gravitational, magneto-rotational). This paper\ndetails high resolution Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations that\nwere carried out to investigate the influence of stellar encounters on disc\ndynamics. Star-star encounters (where the primary has a self-gravitating,\nmarginally stable protostellar disc) were simulated with various orbital\nparameters to investigate the resulting disc structure and dynamics. Crucially,\nthe simulations include the effects of radiative transfer to realistically\nmodel the resulting thermodynamics. Our results show that the accretion history\nand luminosity of the system during the encounter displays many of the features\nof outburst phenomena. In particular, the magnitudes and decay times seen are\ncomparable to those of FU Ori. There are two caveats to this assertion: the\nfirst is that these events are not expected to occur frequently enough to\nexplain all FU Ori or EX Lupi; the second is that the inner discs of these\nsimulations are subject to numerical viscosity, which will act to reduce the\naccretion rate (although it has less of an effect on the total mass accreted).\nIn short, these results cannot rule out binary interactions as a potential\nsource of some FU Ori-esque outbursts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2009 10:01:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The 3CR sources show a bimodal\ndistribution of Excitation Index, a new spectroscopic indicator that measures\nthe relative intensity of low and high excitation lines. This unveils the\npresence of two main sub-populations of radio-loud AGN, High and Low Excitation\nGalaxies (HEG and LEG, respectively). All broad-line objects are HEG from the\npoint of view of their narrow emission line ratios and all HEG are FRII\nradio-galaxies with log L(178) [erg/s] > 32.8. Conversely LEG cover the whole\nrange of radio power encompassed by this 3CR subsample (30.7 < log L(178) <\n35.4) and they are of both FRI and FRII type. The brightest LEG are all FRII.\nHEG and LEG obey to two (quasi) linear correlations between the optical line\nand extended radio luminosities, with HEG being brighter than LEG in the [OIII]\nline by a factor of ~10. HEG and LEG are offset also in a plane that compares\nthe black hole mass and the ionizing nuclear luminosity. However, although HEG\nare associated with higher nuclear luminosities, we find LEG among the\nbrightest radio sources of the sample and with a clear FRII morphology,\nindistinguishable from those seen in HEG. This suggests that LEG are not simply\nobjects with a lower level of accretion. We speculate that the differences\nbetween LEG and HEG are related to a different mode of accretion: LEG are\npowered by hot gas, while HEG require the presence of cold accreting material.\nThe high temperature of the accreting gas in LEG accounts for the lack of\n\"cold\" structures (i.e. molecular torus and Broad Line Region), for the reduced\nradiative output of the accretion disk, and for the lower gas excitation.\n[ABRIDGED]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2009 10:29:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The model contains an extra Higgs doublet, a\nneutral component of which is chosen as dark matter candidate. There are three\ndistinct mass ranges for which consistency both with WMAP abundance and direct\nsearches can be obtained: a low (4 - 8 GeV), a middle (60 - 70 GeV) and a high\n(500 - 1500 GeV) WIMP mass range. The first case is of interest as we showed\nthat the model can at the same time give the correct WMAP abundance and account\nfor the positive DAMA results without contradicting other direct searches. We\npresent how capture in the Sun can further constrain this scenario using\nSuper-Kamiokande data. Indirect detection through neutrinos is challenging for\nthe middle and high mass ranges. For the former, the presence of the so-called\n'iron resonance' gives rise to larger neutrino fluxes for WIMP masses around 60\n- 70 GeV since capture by the Earth is enhanced. The addition of light\nright-handed Majorana neutrinos to the particle content of the model further\nincreases the signal since it opens a direct annihilation channel into\nmono-energetic neutrinos. Neutrinos from the Galactic centre might be detected\nfor heavy WIMPs if the dark matter density at the Galactic centre is\nsubstantially boosted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2009 15:05:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

Assuming that all particles in a cell of the\nphase space move with the same velocity as that of the particle located at the\ncenter of the cell at the beginning of each time step, we successfully\nintegrate the system with no artificial loss of particles. Furthermore,\nsplitting the equations into advection and interaction parts, the method\nconserves the sum of the kinetic energy of particles and the electromagnetic\nenergy. Three test problems, the gyration of particles, the Weibel instability,\nand the wakefield acceleration, are solved by using our scheme. We confirm that\nour scheme can reproduce analytical results of the problems. Though we deal\nwith the 1D2V relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell system, our method can be applied to\nthe 2D3V and 3D3V cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2009 15:58:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-18"}
