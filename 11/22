On day 29 after outburst, a soft X-ray\ncomponent with a peak at ~0.5 keV has appeared, which is tantalising evidence\nfor the beginning of the super-soft X-ray emission phase. We show that an\nabsorbed blackbody model can describe the observed spectra, yielding a\ntemperature of 57 eV, neutral hydrogen column density of 2x10^{21} cm^{-2}, and\na bolometric luminosity of ~10^{36} erg s^{-1}. However, at the same time, we\nalso found a good fit with an absorbed thin-thermal plasma model, yielding a\ntemperature of 0.1 keV, neutral hydrogen column density of 4x10^{21} cm^{-2},\nand a volume emission measure of ~10^{58} cm^{-3}. Owing to low spectral\nresolution and low signal-to-noise ratio below 0.6 keV, the statistical\nparameter uncertainties are large, but the ambiguity of the two very different\nmodels demonstrates that the systematic errors are the main point of concern.\nThe thin-thermal plasma model implies that the soft emission originates from\noptically thin ejecta, while the blackbody model suggests that we are seeing\noptically thick emission from the white dwarf.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Nov 2009 06:10:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Nov 2012 20:19:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

This is the first detailed study of PG 1553+113 in\nthe GeV gamma-ray regime and it allows us to fill a gap of three decades in\nenergy in its spectral energy distribution. We find PG 1553+113 to be a steady\nsource with a hard spectrum that is best fit by a simple power-law in the Fermi\nenergy band. We combine the Fermi data with archival radio, optical, X-ray and\nvery high energy (VHE) gamma-ray data to model its broadband spectral energy\ndistribution and find that a simple, one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model\nprovides a reasonable fit. PG 1553+113 has the softest VHE spectrum of all\nsources detected in that regime and, out of those with significant detections\nacross the Fermi energy bandpass so far, the hardest spectrum in that energy\nregime. Thus, it has the largest spectral break of any gamma-ray source studied\nto date, which could be due to the absorption of the intrinsic gamma-ray\nspectrum by the extragalactic background light (EBL). Assuming this to be the\ncase, we selected a model with a low level of EBL and used it to absorb the\npower-law spectrum from PG 1553+113 measured with Fermi (200 MeV - 157 GeV) to\nfind the redshift which gave the best fit to the measured VHE data (90 GeV -\n1.1 TeV) for this parameterisation of the EBL.

We have searched for benchmark ultra-cool\ndwarfs in widely separated binary systems using SDSS, UKIDSS, and 2MASS. We\nthen estimate spectral types using SDSS spectroscopy and multi-band colors,\nplace constraints on distance, and perform proper motions calculations for all\ncandidates which have sufficient epoch baseline coverage. Analysis of the\nproper motion and distance constraints show that eight of our ultra-cool dwarfs\nare members of widely separated binary systems. Another L3.5 dwarf, SDSS 0832,\nis shown to be a companion to the bright K3 giant Eta Cancri. Such primaries\ncan provide age and metallicity constraints for any companion objects, yielding\nexcellent benchmark objects.

To\nexplore its statistical regularities, we comprehensively examine the trading\nvalue, a measure of the equity activity, of the 3314 most-traded stocks in the\nU.S. equity market and find that (i) the trading values follow a log-normal\ndistribution; (ii) the standard deviation of the growth rate of the trading\nvalue obeys a power-law with the initial trading value, and the power-law\nexponent beta=0.14. Remarkably, both features hold for a wide range of sampling\nintervals, from 5 minutes to 20 trading days. Further, we show that all the\n3314 stocks have long-term correlations, and their Hurst exponents H follow a\nnormal distribution. Furthermore, we find that the Hurst exponent depends on\nthe size of the company. We also show that the relation between the scaling in\nthe growth rate and the long-term correlation is consistent with beta=1-H,\nsimilar to that found recently on human interaction activity by Rybski and\ncollaborators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Nov 2009 15:21:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-24"}
