It consists of an ensemble of nuclei and interacting nucleons\nin nuclear statistical equilibrium. A relativistic mean field model is applied\nfor the nucleons. The masses of the nuclei are taken from nuclear structure\ncalculations which are based on the same nuclear Lagrangian. For known nuclei\nexperimental data is used directly. Excluded volume effects are implemented in\na thermodynamic consistent way so that the transition to uniform nuclear matter\nat large densities can be described. Thus the model can be applied at all\ndensities relevant for supernova simulations, i.e. rho=10^5 - 10^15 g/cm^3, and\nit is possible to calculate a complete supernova EOS table. The model allows to\ninvestigate the role of shell effects, which lead to narrow-peaked\ndistributions around the neutron magic numbers for low temperatures. At larger\ntemperatures the distributions become broad. The significance of the\nstatistical treatment and the nuclear distributions for the composition is\nshown. We find that the contribution of light clusters is very important and is\nonly poorly represented by alpha-particles alone. The results for the EOS are\nsystematically compared to two commonly used models for supernova matter which\nare based on the single nucleus approximation.

But\ndespite the availability of efficient algorithms, the lasso remains\ncomputationally demanding in regression problems where the number of variables\nvastly exceeds the number of data points. A much older method, marginal\nregression, largely displaced by the lasso, offers a promising alternative in\nthis case. Computation for marginal regression is practical even when the\ndimension is very high. In this paper, we study the relative performance of the\nlasso and marginal regression for regression problems in three different\nregimes: (a) exact reconstruction in the noise-free and noisy cases when design\nand coefficients are fixed, (b) exact reconstruction in the noise-free case\nwhen the design is fixed but the coefficients are random, and (c)\nreconstruction in the noisy case where performance is measured by the number of\ncoefficients whose sign is incorrect.\n  In the first regime, we compare the conditions for exact reconstruction of\nthe two procedures, find examples where each procedure succeeds while the other\nfails, and characterize the advantages and disadvantages of each. In the second\nregime, we derive conditions under which marginal regression will provide exact\nreconstruction with high probability. And in the third regime, we derive rates\nof convergence for the procedures and offer a new partitioning of the ``phase\ndiagram,'' that shows when exact or Hamming reconstruction is effective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2009 16:41:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-23"}

Correcting spheroid\nluminosity for passive luminosity evolution and taking into account selection\neffects, we determine that at fixed present-day V-band spheroid luminosity,\nM_BH/L_sph \\propto (1+z)^(2.8+/-1.2).

For certain graph\nalgorithms, however, the $(\\infty,1)$ norm may be a more natural measure of\nperformance.\n  This paper addresses the problem of approximating a real matrix A by a sparse\nrandom matrix X with respect to several norms.

Optimality of\nthe $(\\infty, 1)$ and $(\\infty,2)$ error estimates is established.\nConcentration results for the three norms hold when the entries of X are\nuniformly bounded.

Disks composed of large,\nstrong planetesimals produce more massive planets than disks composed of small,\nweak planetesimals. The maximum radius of icy planets ranges from roughly 1500\nkm to 11,500 km. The formation rate of 1000 km objects - `Plutos' - is a useful\nproxy for the efficiency of icy planet formation. Plutos form more efficiently\nin massive disks, in disks with small planetesimals, and in disks with a range\nof planetesimal sizes. Although Plutos form throughout massive disks, Pluto\nproduction is usually concentrated in the inner disk. Despite the large number\nof Plutos produced in many calculations, icy planet formation is inefficient.\nAt the end of the main sequence lifetime of the central star, Plutos contain\nless than 10% of the initial mass in solid material. This conclusion is\nindependent of the initial mass in the disk or the properties of planetesimals.\nDebris disk formation coincides with the formation of planetary systems\ncontaining Plutos. As Plutos form, they stir leftover planetesimals to large\nvelocities. A cascade of collisions then grinds the leftovers to dust, forming\nan observable debris disk. In disks with small (< 1-10 km) planetesimals,\ncollisional cascades produce luminous debris disks with maximum luminosity\nroughly 0.01 times the stellar luminosity. Disks with larger planetesimals\nproduce much less luminous debris disks. Observations of debris disks around\nA-type and G-type stars strongly favor models with small planetesimals.

The variation of the local spin\norientation in the Fe layer is determined by the competition of the exchange\ncoupling interaction with the hard layer and the magnetostatic energy which\nfavours in-plane magnetisation. Dynamics were studied by monitoring the\nresponse of the Fe layer magnetisation after the abrupt application of a\nmagnetic field which causes the systems to realign via precessional motion.\nThis precessional motion allows us to obtain the frequency spectrum and hence\nexamine the dynamical magnetisation motion.

Simulations show that similar to the\nasteroids in the main belt, MBCs with orbital eccentricities smaller than 0.2\nand inclinations lower than 25 degrees have stable orbits implying that many\nMBCs with initially larger eccentricities and inclinations might have been\nscattered to other regions of the asteroid belt.

The main aim\nof the study is to identify molecular factors that can help stabilizing the\nbiaxial nematic phase.

There exists an optimal\ndipole strength for which this line covers the maximal range of opening angles.\nInterestingly, the inclusion of biaxial GB ellipsoids as building blocks\nreveals the direct $I-N_B$ transitions line even in a non-polar, two-arms\nmodel.

A plausible scenario is\nthat this emission is the afterglow synchrotron emission produced by electrons\naccelerated in the forward shocks. In this scenario, the electrons that produce\nsynchrotron high-energy emission also undergo inverse-Compton (IC) loss and the\nIC scattering with the synchrotron photons should be in the Klein-Nishina\nregime. Here we study effects of the Klein-Nishina scattering on the\nhigh-energy synchrotron afterglow emission. We find that, at early times the\nKlein-Nishina suppression effect on those electrons that produce the\nhigh-energy emission is usually strong and therefore their inverse-Compton loss\nis small with a Compton parameter Y < a few for a wide range of parameter\nspace. This leads to a relatively bright synchrotron afterglow at high energies\nthat can be detected by Fermi LAT. As the Klein-Nishina suppression effect\nweakens with time, the inverse-Compton loss increases and could dominate over\nthe synchrotron loss in some parameter space. This will lead to a faster\ntemporal decay of the high-energy synchrotron emission than what is predicted\nby the standard synchrotron model, which may explain the observed rapid decay\nof the early high-energy gamma-ray emission in GRB090510 and GRB090902B.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Nov 2009 15:55:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}
