Such expansions should exhibit marked improvement over the\nconventional three-flavor chiral expansion. Although one can theoretically\nformulate two-flavor theories for the various hyperon multiplets, the nearness\nof kaon thresholds can seriously undermine the effectiveness of the\nperturbative expansion in practice. We investigate the importance of virtual\nkaon thresholds on hyperon properties, specifically their masses and isovector\naxial charges. Using a three-flavor expansion that includes SU(3) breaking\neffects, we uncover the underlying expansion parameter governing the\ndescription of virtual kaon thresholds. For spin-half hyperons, this expansion\nparameter is quite small. Consequently virtual kaon contributions are well\ndescribed in the two-flavor theory by terms analytic in the pion mass-squared.\nFor spin three-half hyperons, however, one is closer to the kaon production\nthreshold, and the expansion parameter is not as small. Breakdown of SU(2)\nchiral perturbation theory is shown to arise from a pole in the expansion\nparameter associated with the kaon threshold. Estimating higher-order\ncorrections to the expansion parameter is necessary to ascertain whether the\ntwo-flavor theory of spin three-half hyperons remains perturbative. We find\nthat, despite higher-order corrections, there is a useful perturbative\nexpansion for the masses and isovector axial charges of both spin-half and spin\nthree-half hyperons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 2009 20:05:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Dec 2010 02:09:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

Most\nmodels of such shocks assume that they are steady and propagating perpendicular\nto the magnetic field. Real shocks often violate both of these assumptions and\nthe media through which they propagate are inhomogeneous. We use the code\nemployed previously to produce the first time-dependent simulations of\nfast-mode, oblique C-type shocks interacting with density perturbations. We\ninclude a self-consistent calculation of the thermal and ionisation balances\nand a fluid treatment of grains. We identify features that develop when a\nmultifluid shock encounters a density inhomogeneity to investigate whether any\npart of the precursor region ever behaves in a quasi-steady fashion. If it does\nthe shock may be modelled approximately without solving the time-dependent\nhydromagnetic equations. Simulations were made for initially steady oblique\nC-type shocks encountering density inhomogeneities. For a semi-finite\ninhomogeneity with a density larger than the surrounding medium, a transmitted\nshock evolves from being J-type to a steady C-type shock on a timescale\ncomparable to the ion-flow time through it. A sufficiently upstream part of the\nprecursor of an evolving J-type shock is quasi-steady. The ion-flow timescale\nis also relevant for the evolution of a shock moving into a region of\ndecreasing density. The models for shocks propagating into regions in which the\ndensity increases and then decreases to its initial value cannot be entirely\ndescribed in terms of the results obtained for monotonically increasing and\ndecreasing densities. For the latter model, the long-term evolution to a C-type\nshock cannot be approximated by quasi-steady models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 2009 17:07:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

We propose a method that is a combination\nof two well-known techniques from Algorithmic Differentiation (AD): univariate\nTaylor propagation on scalars (UTPS) and first-order forward and reverse on\nmatrices. The combination leads to a technique that we would like to call\nunivariate Taylor propagation on matrices (UTPM). The method inherits many\ndesirable properties: It is easy to implement, it is very efficient and it\nreturns not only $\\nabla^D f$ but yields in the process also the derivatives\n$\\nabla^d f$ for $d \\leq D$.

There are several challenges in estimating\ncluster masses, particularly (a) the sensitivity to astrophysical effects and\nobservational systematics that modify the signal relative to the theoretical\nexpectations, and (b) biases that can arise due to assumptions in the mass\nestimation method, such as the assumed radial profile of the cluster. All of\nthese challenges are more problematic in the inner regions of the cluster,\nsuggesting that their influence would ideally be suppressed for the purpose of\nmass estimation. However, at any given radius the differential surface density\nmeasured by lensing is sensitive to all mass within that radius, and the\ncorrupted signal from the inner parts is spread out to all scales. We develop a\nnew statistic that is ideal for estimation of cluster masses because it\ncompletely eliminates mass contributions below a chosen scale (which we suggest\nshould be about 20 per cent of the virial radius), and thus reduces sensitivity\nto systematic and astrophysical effects. We use simulated and analytical\nprofiles to quantify systematic biases on the estimated masses for several\nstandard methods of mass estimation, finding that these can lead to significant\nmass biases that range from ten to over fifty per cent. The mass uncertainties\nwhen using our new statistic are reduced by up to a factor of ten relative to\nthe standard methods, while only moderately increasing the statistical errors.\nThis new method of mass estimation will enable a higher level of precision in\nfuture science work with weak lensing mass estimates for galaxy clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 2009 22:51:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2010 16:30:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The\nBio-PEPA process algebra is equipped with the capability of explicitly defining\nquantitative information such as compartment volumes and membrane surface\nareas. Furthermore, the recent development of the Bio-PEPA Eclipse Plug-in\nallows us to perform a correct stochastic simulation of multi-compartmental\nmodels.\n  Here we present a Bio-PEPA compartmental model of the cAMP/PKA/MAPK pathway.\nWe analyse the system using the Bio-PEPA Eclipse Plug-in and we show the\ncorrectness of our model by comparison with an existing ODE model. Furthermore,\nwe perform computational experiments in order to investigate certain properties\nof the pathway. Specifically, we focus on the system response to the inhibition\nand strengthening of feedback loops and to the variation in the activity of key\npathway reactions and we observe how these modifications affect the behaviour\nof the pathway.

That has been attributed to polarization\nretention (backswitching) induced by the residual depolarization field between\nthe monopolar pulses where the applied field is lower than the depolarization\nfield, and explained using the LPD-SICI model (LPD-SICI stands for local phase\ndecomposition caused by switching-induced charge injection).

Random searches have proven to be very efficient as well\nas easy to implement, compared e.g. to searches along regular grids in\nparameter space. Knowledge of the parameterised shape of the signal searched\nfor adds structure to the parameter space, i.e., there are usually regions\nrequiring to be densely searched while in other regions a coarser search is\nsufficient. On the other hand, prior information identifies the regions in\nwhich a search will actually be promising or may likely be in vain. Defining\nspecific figures of merit allows one to combine both template metric and prior\ndistribution and devise optimal sampling schemes over the parameter space. We\nshow an example related to the gravitational wave signal from a binary inspiral\nevent. Here the template metric and prior information are particularly\ncontradictory, since signals from low-mass systems tolerate the least mismatch\nin parameter space while high-mass systems are far more likely, as they imply a\ngreater signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and hence are detectable to greater\ndistances.

The underlying assumption that giants represent all the\nstars, and accurately trace the chemical evolution of a stellar population, is\nunder debate. In particular, recent observations of a few microlensed dwarf\nstars give a very different picture of the evolution of the Bulge from that\ngiven by the giant stars. [ABRIDGED] We perform a detailed elemental abundance\nanalysis of dwarf stars in the Galactic bulge, based on high-resolution spectra\nthat were obtained while the stars were optically magnified during\ngravitational microlensing events.

We find that the\nstars span the full range of metallicities from [Fe/H]=-0.72 to +0.54, and an\naverage metallicity of <[Fe/H]>=-0.08+/-0.47, close to the average metallicity\nbased on giant stars in the Bulge. Furthermore, the stars follow well-defined\nabundance trends, that for [Fe/H]<0 are very similar to those of the local\nGalactic thick disc. This suggests that the Bulge and the thick disc have had,\nat least partially, comparable chemical histories. At sub-solar metallicities\nwe find the Bulge dwarf stars to have consistently old ages, while at\nsuper-solar metallicities we find a wide range of ages.

At low\ntemperature, a substantial non-zero conductivity is only possible for a\nfrequency range $\\omega>\\omega_g=k$. This tallies with the simple fact that at\nleast an amount of energy $\\omega_g$ is needed to create an excitation of\nmomentum $k$. Due to the existence of this ``gap'',one may expect that at zero\nfrequency limit the real part of momentum dependent conductivity falls\nexponentially with $\\frac{1}{T}$. Using analytic methods, we found a\n$\\exp(-\\frac{\\omega_c}{T})$ falloff of the real part of conductivity with\ninverse temperature. Interestingly, $\\omega_g \\neq \\omega_c$.

Recent\nobservations from the high resolution Hinode/SOT telescope allow us to compute\nvelocities perpendicularly to the line-of-sight or transverse velocities.\nCombining simultaneous observations obtained in H-alpha with Hinode/SOT and the\nMSDP spectrograph operating in the Meudon solar tower we derive the velocity\nvectors of a quiescent prominence. The velocities perpendicular to the\nline-of-sight are measured by time slice technique, the Dopplershifts by the\nbisector method. The Dopplershifts of bright threads derived from the MSDP\nreach 15 km/s at the edges of the prominence and are between +/- 5 km/s in the\ncenter of the prominence. Even though they are minimum values due to seeing\neffect, they are of the same order as the transverse velocities. These\nmeasurements are very important because they suggest that the\nverticalstructures shown in SOT may not be real vertical magnetic structures in\nthe sky plane. The vertical structures could be a pile up of dips in more or\nless horizontal magnetic field lines in a 3D perspective, as it was proposed by\nmany MHD modelers.

A jump is introduced in the thermal pressure of the plasma, across\nwhich the otherwise spatially uniform temperature and density change by the\nfactor 100. The electrons from the hot plasma expand into the cool one and the\ncharge imbalance drags a beam of cool electrons into the hot plasma. This\ndouble layer reduces the electron temperature gradient. The presence of the\nlow-pressure plasma modifies the proton dynamics compared to the plasma\nexpansion into a vacuum. The jump in the thermal pressure develops into a\nprimary shock.
