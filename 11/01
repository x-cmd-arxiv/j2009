This close\ncorrespondence between SF and BHA would naturally yield a BH mass-galaxy mass\ncorrelation, whereas a BH mass-bulge mass correlation is observed. To explore\nthis apparent contradiction we study the SF in spheroid-dominated galaxies\nbetween z=1 and the present day. We use 903 galaxies from the COMBO-17 survey\nwith M* >2x10^10M_sun, ultraviolet and infrared-derived SFRs from Spitzer and\nGALEX, and morphologies from GEMS HST/ACS imaging. Using stacking techniques,\nwe find that <25% of all SF occurs in spheroid-dominated galaxies (Sersic index\nn>2.5), while the BHAR that we would expect if the global scalings held is\nthree times higher. This rules out the simplest picture of co-evolution, in\nwhich SF and BHA trace each other at all times. These results could be\nexplained if SF and BHA occur in the same events, but offset in time, for\nexample at different stages of a merger event. However, one would then expect\nto see the corresponding star formation activity in early-stage mergers, in\nconflict with observations. We conclude that the major episodes of SF and BHA\noccur in different events, with the bulk of SF happening in isolated disks and\nmost BHA occurring in major mergers. The apparent global co-evolution results\nfrom the regulation of the BH growth by the potential well of the galactic\nspheroid, which includes a major contribution from disrupted disk stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Nov 2009 02:34:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

The spin-down luminosity of PSR\nJ1852+0040, E-dot = 3.0E32 erg/s, is an order-of-magnitude smaller than L_x.\nFitting of the X-ray spectrum to two blackbodies finds small emitting radii,\nR_1 = 1.9 km and R_2 = 0.45 km, for components of kT_1 = 0.30 keV and kT_2 =\n0.52 keV, respectively.

The wall forcing\nconsists of a stationary distribution of spanwise velocity that alternates in\nthe streamwise direction. The idea behind the forcing builds upon the existing\ntechnique of the spanwise wall oscillation, and exploits the convective nature\nof the flow to achieve an unsteady interaction with turbulence.\n  The analysis takes advantage of the equivalent laminar flow, that is solved\nanalytically to show that the energetic cost of the forcing is unaffected by\nturbulence. In a turbulent flow, the alternate forcing is found to behave\nsimilarly to the oscillating wall; in particular an optimal wavelength is found\nthat yields a maximal reduction of turbulent drag. The energetic performance is\nsignificantly improved, with more than 50% of maximum friction saving at large\nintensities of the forcing, and a net energetic saving of 23% for smaller\nintensities.\n  Such a steady, wall-based forcing may pave the way to passively interacting\nwith the turbulent flow to achieve drag reduction through a suitable\ndistribution of roughness, designed to excite a selected streamwise wavelength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Oct 2009 23:06:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

In order to\ndelineate and adapt to dynamic changes in the pervasive computing environment,\ncontext-aware applications often need to specify and check behavioral\nconsistency constraints over the contexts. This problem is challenging mainly\ndue to the distributed and asynchronous nature of pervasive computing\nenvironments. Specifically, the critical issue in checking behavioral\nconstraints is the temporal ordering of contextual activities. The contextual\nactivities usually involve multiple context collecting devices, which are\nfully-decentralized and interact in an asynchronous manner. However, existing\ncontext consistency checking schemes do not work in asynchronous environments,\nsince they implicitly assume the availability of a global clock or relay on\nsynchronized interactions.\n  To this end, we propose the Ordering Global Activity (OGA) algorithm, which\ndetects the ordering of the global activities based on predicate detection in\nasynchronous environments. The essence of our approach is the message causality\nand its on-the-fly coding as logic vector clocks in asynchronous environments.\nWe implement the Middleware Infrastructure for Predicate detection in\nAsynchronous environments (MIPA), over which the OGA algorithm is implemented\nand evaluated. The evaluation results show the impact of asynchrony on the\nchecking of behavioral consistency constraints, which justifies the primary\nmotivation of our work. They also show that OGA can achieve accurate checking\nof behavioral consistency constraints in dynamic pervasive computing\nenvironments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Nov 2009 07:20:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-03"}

Reformulating the problem of reflectionless transmission as a\nquasi-linear eigenvalue problem for the potential depth, an approximation for\nthe specific height of the potential that supports reflectionless transmission\nof the incoming matter wave is derived via modification of the\nRayleigh-Schroedinger time-independent perturbation theory. The approximation\nprovides highly accurate description of the resonance position for all the\nresonance orders if the nonlinearity parameter is small compared with the\nincoming particles chemical potential. Notably, the result for the first\ntransmission resonance turns out to be exact, i.e., the derived formula for the\nresonant potential height gives the exact value of the first nonlinear\nresonances position for all the allowed variation range of the involved\nparameters, the nonlinearity parameter and chemical potential. This has been\nshown by constructing the exact solution of the problem for the first\nresonance. Furthermore, the presented approximation reveals that, in contrast\nto the linear case, in the nonlinear case reflectionless transmission may occur\nnot only for potential wells but also for potential barriers with positive\npotential height. It also shows that the nonlinear shift of the resonance\nposition from the position of the corresponding linear resonance is\napproximately described as a linear function of the resonance order. Finally, a\ncompact (yet, highly accurate) analytic formula for the n-th order resonance\nposition is constructed via combination of analytical and numerical methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Nov 2009 13:20:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-12"}
