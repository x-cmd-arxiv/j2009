In\nthe present work we perform a comprehensive calibration of our own flexible SPS\n(FSPS) model against a suite of data. Several public SPS models are\nintercompared, including the models of Bruzual & Charlot (BC03), Maraston (M05)\nand FSPS. The relative strengths and weaknesses of these models are evaluated,\nwith the following conclusions: 1) The FSPS and BC03 models compare favorably\nwith MC data at all ages, whereas M05 colors are too red and the age-dependence\nis incorrect; 2) All models yield similar optical and near-IR colors for old\nmetal-poor systems, and yet they all provide poor fits to the integrated J-K\nand V-K colors of both MW and M31 star clusters; 4) All models predict ugr\ncolors too red, D4000 strengths too strong and Hdelta strengths too weak\ncompared to massive red sequence galaxies, under the assumption that such\ngalaxies are composed solely of old metal-rich stars; 5) FSPS and, to a lesser\nextent, BC03 can reproduce the optical and near-IR colors of post-starburst\ngalaxies, while M05 cannot. Reasons for these discrepancies are explored. The\nfailure at predicting the ugr colors, D4000, and Hdelta strengths can be\nexplained by some combination of a minority population of metal-poor stars,\nyoung stars, blue straggler and/or blue horizontal branch stars, but not by\nappealing to inadequacies in either theoretical stellar atmospheres or\ncanonical evolutionary phases (e.g., the main sequence turn-off). We emphasize\nthat due to a lack of calibrating star cluster data in regions of the\nmetallicity-age plane relevant for galaxies, all of these models continue to\nsuffer from serious uncertainties that are difficult to quantify.

To reconcile investigations of\ndifferent diagnostics within such models, a highly clumped wind with very low\nmass-loss rates needs to be invoked. Particularly, unsaturated UV resonance\nlines seem to indicate rates an order of magnitude (or even more) lower than\npreviously accepted values. We investigate resonance line formation in\ninhomogeneous hot star winds with non-monotonic velocity fields by means of 2D\nstochastic and pseudo-2D radiation-hydrodynamic wind models. A Monte-Carlo\nradiative transfer code is presented and used to produce synthetic line\nspectra. Results: The optically thin clumping limit is only valid for very weak\nlines. For intermediate strong lines, the velocity spans of the clumps are of\ncentral importance. Current hydrodynamical models predict spans that are too\nlarge to reproduce observed profiles unless a very low mass-loss rate is\ninvoked. By simulating lower spans in 2D stochastic models, the profile\nstrengths become drastically reduced, and are consistent with higher mass-loss\nrates. To simultaneously meet the constraints from strong lines, the\ninter-clump medium must be non-void.

In this framework the Ricci scalar acts as the kinetical\nterm of the strain field whose potential is represented by the additional\nterms. Here we are presenting the linearised version of the theory in order to\nanalyze its implications in the weak field limit. First we discuss the recovery\nof the Newtonian limit. We find that the typical static weak field limit\nimposes a constraint on the values of the two parameters (Lame coefficients) of\nthe theory. Once the constraint has been implemented, the typical gravitational\npotential turns out to be Yukawa-like. The value for the Yukawa parameter is\nconsistent with the constraints coming from the experimental data at the Solar\nsystem and galactic scales. We then come to the propagating solutions of the\nlinearised Einstein equations in vacuo, i.e. to gravitational waves. Here,\nanalogously with other alternative or extended theories of gravity, the\npresence of the strain field produces massive waves, where massive (in this\ncompletely classical context) means subluminal. Furthermore longitudinal\npolarization modes are allowed too, thus lending, in principle, a way for\ndiscriminating these waves from the plane GR ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2009 18:24:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

The Alfv\\'en waves are assumed to penetrate the strands from\ntheir footpoints, at which we consider different wave energy inputs. As a\nresult, the loop strands can have different heating profiles, and the\ndifferential heating can lead to a varying cross-field temperature in the total\ncoronal loop. The simulation of TRACE observations by means of this loop model\nimplies two uniform temperatures along the loop length, one inferred from the\n171:195 filter ratio and the other from the 171:284 ratio. The reproduced flat\ntemperature profiles are consistent with those inferred from the observed EUV\ncoronal loops. According to our model, the flat temperature profile is a\nconsequence of the coronal loop consisting of filaments, which have different\ntemperatures but almost similar emission measures in the cross-field direction.\nFurthermore, when we assume certain errors in the simulated loop emissions\n(e.g., due to photometric uncertainties in the TRACE filters) and use the\ntriple-filter analysis, our simulated loop conditions become consistent with\nthose of an isothermal plasma.

To this end, we\nanalysed high-resolution spectra of 18 sample stars for the presence of\nabsorption lines of Tc and Li. The abundance of the latter was determined by\ncomparing the observed spectra to hydrostatic MARCS model spectra. Bolometric\nmagnitudes were established from near-IR photometry and pulsation periods. We\nreclassify the star V441 Cyg as Tc-rich, and the unusual Mira star R Hya, as\nwell as W Eri, as Tc-poor. The abundance of Li, or an upper limit to it, was\ndetermined for all of the sample stars. In all stars with Tc we also detected\nLi. Most of them have a Li content slightly below the solar photospheric value,\nexcept for V441 Cyg, which has ~1000 times the solar abundance. We also found\nthat, similar to Tc, a lower luminosity limit seems to exist for the presence\nof Li. We conclude that the higher Li abundance found in the cooler and higher\nluminosity objects could stem from a Li production mechanism operating on the\nAGB. The stellar mass might have a crucial influence on this (extra-mixing)\nproduction mechanism. It was speculated that the declining pulsation period of\nR Hya is caused by a recent thermal pulse (TP). While not detecting Tc does not\nrule out a TP, it indicates that the TPs are not strong enough to drive\ndredge-up in R Hya. V441 Cyg, on the other hand, could either be a low-mass,\nintrinsic S-star that produced its large amount of Li by extra-mixing\nprocesses, or an intermediate-mass star (M>=M_sun) undergoing Li production due\nto hot bottom burning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2009 11:06:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Let us recall that Quantum Mechanics (QM) demands an upper limit on\nthe acceleration of a test particle. On the other hand, it is pointed out here\nthat, if a Schwarzschild BH would exist, the acceleration of the test particle\nwould blow up at the event horizon in violation of QM. Thus the concept of an\nexact BH is in contradiction of QM and quantum gravity (QG). It is also\nreminded that the mass of a BH actually appears as an INTEGRATION CONSTANT of\nEinstein equations. And it has been shown that the value of this integration\nconstant is actually zero. Thus even classically, there cannot be finite mass\nBHs though zero mass BH is allowed. It has been further shown that during\ncontinued gravitational collapse, radiation emanating from the contracting\nobject gets trapped within it by the runaway gravitational field. As a\nconsequence, the contracting body attains a quasi-static state where outward\ntrapped radiation pressure gets balanced by inward gravitational pull and the\nideal classical BH state is never formed in a finite proper time. In other\nwords, continued gravitational collapse results in an \"Eternally Collapsing\nObject\" which is a ball of hot plasma and which is asymptotically approaching\nthe true BH state with M=0 after radiating away its entire mass energy. And if\nwe include QM, this contraction must halt at a radius suggested by highest QM\nacceleration. In any case no EH is ever formed and in reality, there is no\nquantum information paradox.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2009 12:25:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-02"}

Two structural\nconfigurations have been considered which are suggested from recent\nexperiments. They differ by the local symmetry and the spacing between the two\nstrands of the biatomic Fe chain. Since both configurations are very close in\ntotal energy they may coexist in experiment. We have investigated collinear\nferro- and antiferromagnetic solutions as well as a collinear state with two\nmoments in one direction and one in the opposite direction (up-down-up-state).\nFor the structure with a small interchain spacing, there is a strong exchange\ninteraction between the strands and the ferromagnetic state is energetically\nfavorable. In the structure with larger spacing, the two strands are\nmagnetically nearly decoupled and exhibit antiferromagnetic order along the\nchain. In both cases, due to hybridization with the Ir substrate the exchange\ninteraction along the chain axis is relatively small compared to freestanding\nbiatomic iron chains. The easy magnetization axis of the Fe chains also\nswitches with the structural configuration and is out-of-plane for the\nferromagnetic chains with small spacing and along the chain axis for the\nantiferromagnetic chains with large spacing between the two strands. Calculated\nscanning tunneling microscopy images and spectra suggest the possibility to\nexperimentally distinguish between the two structural and magnetic\nconfigurations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2009 12:49:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

We\nillustrate the complexity of the folding kinetics and generic aspects of the\ncollapse of RNA and proteins upon force quench, using simulations of an RNA\nhairpin and theory based on the de Gennes model for homopolymer collapse. The\nfolding time, $\\tau_F$, depends asymmetrically on $\\delta f_S = f_S - f_m$ and\n$\\delta f_Q = f_m - f_Q$ where $f_S$ ($f_Q$) is the stretch (quench) force, and\n$f_m$ is the transition mid-force of the RNA hairpin. In accord with\nexperiments, the relaxation kinetics of the molecular extension, $R(t)$, occurs\nin three stages: a rapid initial decrease in the extension is followed by a\nplateau, and finally an abrupt reduction in $R(t)$ that occurs as the native\nstate is approached.\n  The duration of the plateau increases as $\\lambda =\\tau_Q/\\tau_F$ decreases\n(where $\\tau_Q$ is the time in which the force is reduced from $f_S$ to $f_Q$).\nVariations in the mechanisms of force quench relaxation as $\\lambda$ is altered\nare reflected in the experimentally measurable time-dependent entropy, which is\ncomputed directly from the folding trajectories. An analytical solution of the\nde Gennes model under tension reproduces the multistage stage kinetics in\n$R(t)$. The prediction that the initial stages of collapse should also be a\ngeneric feature of polymers is validated by simulation of the kinetics of\ntoroid (globule) formation in semiflexible (flexible) homopolymers in poor\nsolvents upon quenching the force from a fully stretched state.

Performing such a transport along the null\ngeodesic of photons arriving from the galaxy, they found that the cosmological\nredshift is purely kinematic. Here we argue that one should rather transport\nthe velocity four-vector along the geodesic connecting the points of\nintersection of the world-lines of the galaxy and the observer with the\nhypersurface of constant cosmic time. We find that the resulting relation\nbetween the transported velocity and the redshift of arriving photons is not\ngiven by a relativistic Doppler formula. Instead, for small redshifts it\ncoincides with the well known non-relativistic decomposition of the redshift\ninto a Doppler (kinematic) component and a gravitational one. We perform such a\ndecomposition for arbitrary large redshifts and derive a formula for the\nkinematic component of the cosmological redshift, valid for any FLRW cosmology.\nIn particular, in a universe with Omega_m = 0.24 and Omega_Lambda = 0.76, a\nquasar at a redshift 6, at the time of emission of photons reaching us today\nhad the recession velocity v = 0.997c. This can be contrasted with v = 0.96c,\nhad the redshift been entirely kinematic. Thus, for recession velocities of\nsuch high-redshift sources, the effect of deceleration of the early Universe\nclearly prevails over the effect of its relatively recent acceleration. Last\nbut not least, we show that the so-called proper recession velocities of\ngalaxies, commonly used in cosmology, are in fact radial components of the\ngalaxies' four-velocity vectors. As such, they can indeed attain superluminal\nvalues, but should not be regarded as real velocities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2009 13:28:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Apr 2010 10:47:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2011 17:59:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

We show how\nto estimate a number of all spins in the system and the intra-block coupling\nconstants. We also suggest how it is possible to eliminate excitations trapped\nin such blocks, which may disturb the state transfer. Importantly, one uses\nonly at-ends data and needs to be able to put the system to either the\nmaximally magnetized or the maximally mixed state. This can obtained by\ncontrolling a global decoherence parameter, such as temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2009 15:47:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

The particular potential chosen\nis a distorted Kronig-Penney model. This theorem relates the phase shifts of\nthe states at each band edge to the number of states crossing that edge, as the\nsystem evolves from a simple periodic potential to a distorted one. By applying\nthis relationship to the two edges of each energy band, the modified Levinson\ntheorem for quasi-periodic potentials is derived. These two theorems differ\nfrom the usual ones for isolated potentials in non-relativistic and\nrelativistic quantum mechanics by a crucial alternating sign factor $(-1)^{s}$,\nwhere $s$ refers to the adjacent gap or band index, as explained in the text.\nWe also relate the total number of bound states present in each energy gap due\nto the distortion to the phase shifts at its edges. At the end we present an\noverall relationship between all of the phase shifts at the band edges and the\ntotal number of bound states present.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2009 15:57:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-19"}
