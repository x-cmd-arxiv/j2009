Evidence suggests that gamma-ray prompt emission and X-ray\nflares share a common origin and that at least some flares can only be\nexplained by long-lasting central engine activity. We have developed a shell\nmodel code to address the question of how X-ray flares are produced within the\nframework of the internal shock model. The shell model creates randomized GRB\nexplosions from a central engine with multiple shells and follows those shells\nas they collide, merge and spread, producing prompt emission and X-ray flares.\nWe pay special attention to the time history of central engine activity,\ninternal shocks, and observed flares, but do not calculate the shock dynamics\nand radiation processes in detail. Using the empirical E_p - E_iso (Amati)\nrelation with an assumed Band function spectrum for each collision and an\nempirical flare temporal profile, we calculate the gamma-ray (Swift/BAT band)\nand X-ray (Swift/XRT band) lightcurves for arbitrary central engine activity\nand compare the model results with the observational data. We show that the\nobserved X-ray flare phenomenology can be explained within the internal shock\nmodel. The number, width and occurring time of flares are then used to diagnose\nthe central engine activity, putting constraints on the energy, ejection time,\nwidth and number of ejected shells.

We present results from 3D emission modeling, including\nthe Special Relativistic effects of aberration and time-of-flight delays and\nalso rotational sweepback of B-field lines, in the geometric context of polar\ncap (PC), outer gap (OG), and two-pole caustic (TPC) pulsar models. In contrast\nto the general belief that these very old, rapidly-rotating neutron stars (NSs)\nshould have largely pair-starved magnetospheres due to the absence of\nsignificant pair production, we find that most of the light curves are best fit\nby TPC and OG models, which indicates the presence of narrow accelerating gaps\nlimited by robust pair production -- even in these pulsars with very low\nspin-down luminosities. The gamma-ray pulse shapes and relative phase lags with\nrespect to the radio pulses point to high-altitude emission being dominant for\nall geometries. We also find exclusive differentiation of the current gamma-ray\nMSP population into two MSP sub-classes: light curve shapes and lags across\nwavebands impose either pair-starved PC (PSPC) or TPC / OG-type geometries. In\nthe first case, the radio pulse has a small lag with respect to the single\ngamma-ray pulse, while the (first) gamma-ray peak usually trails the radio by a\nlarge phase offset in the latter case. Finally, we find that the flux\ncorrection factor as a function of magnetic inclination and observer angles is\ntypically of order unity for all models. Our calculation of light curves and\nflux correction factor for the case of MSPs is therefore complementary to the\n\"ATLAS paper\" of Watters et al. for younger pulsars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2009 16:43:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

Here we show that the matching\nof both conditions is simplified by the intrinsic relaxation behavior of\nultracold fermionic systems: For the particular example of a linear ramp we\nexamine the transient regime of prethermalization [M.

Two\nmain results are obtained. First, we find that apart from the familiar\nconserved integrals for mass, momentum, energy, angular momentum and Galilean\nmomentum, and volumetric entropy, additional kinematic conserved integrals\narise only for non-isentropic equations of state given by a generalized form of\nthe well-known polytropic equation of state with dimension-dependent exponent\n$\\gamma=1+2/n$, such that the proportionality coefficient is an arbitrary\nfunction of the entropy (per unit mass). Second, we show that the only\nvorticity conserved integrals consist of a circulatory entropy (which vanishes\nprecisely when the fluid flow is irrotational) in all even dimensions. In\nparticular, the vorticity integrals for helicity in odd dimensions and\nenstrophy in even dimensions are found to be no longer conserved for any\nnon-isentropic equation of state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2009 17:15:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2010 22:35:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 7 Mar 2015 20:31:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

This poses a major\nchallenge for cosmological models of galaxy formation. Galaxies form at the\ncentre of dark matter halos through a combination of hierarchical merging and\ngas accretion along cold streams, and should rapidly grow their bulge through\nmergers and instabilities. Cosmological simulations predict galaxies to have\nmost of their mass in the central bulge, and therefore an angular momentum much\nbelow the observed level, except in dwarf galaxies. We propose that the\ncontinuous return of fresh gas by stellar populations over cosmic times could\nsolve this issue. A population of stars formed at a given instant typically\nreturns half of its initial mass in the form of gas over 10 billion years, and\nthe process is not dominated by rapid supernovae explosions but by the\nlong-term mass-loss from low- and intermediate-mass stars. Using simulations of\ngalaxy formation, we show that this recycling of gas can strongly affect the\nstructural evolution of massive galaxies, potentially solving the bulge\nfraction issue: we find that the bulge-to-disk ratio of a massive galaxy can be\ndivided by a factor of 3. The continuous recycling of baryons through star\nformation and stellar mass loss helps the growth of disks and their survival to\ninteractions and mergers. Instead of forming only early-type,\nspheroid-dominated galaxies (S0 and ellipticals), the standard cosmological\nmodel can then successfully account for massive late-type, disk-dominated\nspiral galaxies (Sb-Sc).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2009 17:44:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2010 15:47:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 13 Apr 2010 15:59:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The traditional view on how to enable CSIT has\nbeen as follows so far: In time-division duplexed (TDD) systems, uplink (UL)\nand downlink (DL) channel reciprocity allows the use of a training sequence in\nthe UL direction, which is exploited to obtain an UL channel estimate. This\nestimate is in turn recycled in the next downlink slot. In frequency-division\nduplexed (FDD) systems, which lack the UL and DL reciprocity, the CSIT is\nprovided via the use of a dedicated feedback link of limited capacity between\nthe receivers and the transmitter. In this paper, we focus on TDD systems and\nput this classical approach in question. In particular, we show that the\ntraditional TDD setup above fails to fully exploit the channel reciprocity in\nits true sense. In fact, we show that the system can benefit from a combined\nCSIT acquisition strategy mixing the use of limited feedback and that of a\ntraining sequence. This combining gives rise to a very interesting joint\nestimation and detection problem for which we propose two iterative algorithms.\nAn outage rate based framework is also developed which gives the optimal\nresource split between training and feedback. We demonstrate the potential of\nthis hybrid combining in terms of the improved CSIT quality under a global\ntraining and feedback resource constraint.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2009 18:51:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-05"}

This algebra plays the role of the coordinate ring of the\nresulting orbifold and serves as a substitute for the ring of invariant\npolynomials from the viewpoint of geometry and physics. Its Hochschild\ncohomology predicts various Hecke algebras and deformations of the orbifold. In\nthis article, we investigate the ring structure of the Hochschild cohomology of\nthe skew group algebra. We show that the cup product coincides with a natural\nsmash product, transferring the cohomology of a group action into a group\naction on cohomology. We express the algebraic structure of Hochschild\ncohomology in terms of a partial order on the group (modulo the kernel of the\naction). This partial order arises after assigning to each group element the\ncodimension of its fixed point space. We describe the algebraic structure for\nCoxeter groups, where this partial order is given by the reflection length\nfunction; a similar combinatorial description holds for an infinite family of\ncomplex reflection groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2009 20:51:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-05"}

The pressure pulse stretch-modulates voltage-gated Na (Nav) channels\nembedded in the axon membrane, causing their accelerated activation and\ninactivation and increasing peak channel conductance. As a result, the action\npotential propagates due to mechano-electrical activation of Nav channels by\nstraggling ionic currents and the axoplasmic pressure pulse. The velocity of\nsuch propagation is higher than in the classical purely electrical Nav\nactivation mechanism, and it may be close to the velocity of propagation of\npressure pulses in the axoplasm. Extracellular Ca ions influxing during the\nvoltage spike, or Ca ions released from intracellular stores, may trigger a\nmechanism that generates and augments the pressure pulse, thus opposing its\nviscous decay.

We built a simple and fast non-hydrodynamic\nmodel, QWIND, where we assume that a wind is launched from the accretion disc\nat supersonic velocities of the order of a few 10^2 km/s and we concentrate on\nthe subsequent supersonic phase. We show that this model can produce a wind\nwith terminal velocities of the order of 10^4 km/s. There are three zones in\nthe wind, only the middle one of which can launch a wind: in the inner zone the\nwind is too ionized and so experiences only the Compton radiation force which\nis not effective in accelerating gas. This inner failed wind however plays an\nimportant role in shielding the next zone, lowering the ionization parameter\nthere. In the middle zone the lower ionization of the gas leads to a much\nlarger radiation force and the gas achieves escape velocity This middle zone is\nquite thin (about 100 gravitational radii). The outer, third, zone is shielded\nfrom the UV radiation by the central wind zone and so does not achieve a high\nenough acceleration to reach escape velocity. We also describe a simple\nanalytic approximation of our model, based on neglecting the effects of gravity\nduring the acceleration phase. This analytic approach is in agreement with the\nresults of the numerical code, and is a powerful way to check whether a\nradiation driven wind can be accelerated with a given set of initial\nparameters. Our analytical analysis and the fast QWIND model are in agreement\nwith more complex hydrodynamical models, and allow an exploration of the\ndependence of the wind properties for a wide set of initial parameters: black\nhole mass, Eddington ratio, initial density profile, X-ray to UV ratio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2009 01:29:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The X-ray spectrum is characterized by two main peculiar\nfeatures, i) a strong soft excess with a steep rise below about 1.3 keV and ii)\na deep drop in flux above 8.2 keV. We focus here on a reflection-based\ninterpretation which interprets both features, as well as the large soft\nexcess, in terms of partially ionized reflection off the inner accretion disc.\nWe show that the two peculiar spectral features mentioned above can be\nreproduced by two relativistic emission lines due to Fe K and Fe L. The lines\nare produced in the inner accretion disc and independently yield consistent\ndisc parameters. We argue that the high L/K intensity ratio is broadly\nconsistent with expectations from an ionized accretion disc reflection,\nindicating that they belong to a single ionized reflection component. The\nspectral shape, X-ray flux, and variability properties are very similar in the\nXMM-Newton and Suzaku observations, performed about 5 years apart. The overall\nX-ray spectrum and variability can be described by a simple two-component model\ncomprising a steep power law continuum plus its ionised reflection off the\ninner accretion disc.

We study a generalization of this result for detectors moving\nwith a time-dependent acceleration $g(\\tau)$ along a given direction. After\ndefining the rate of excitation of the detector appropriately, we evaluate this\nrate for time-dependent acceleration, $g(\\tau)$, to linear order in the\nparameter $\\eta = \\dot g / g^2$. In this case, we have three length scales in\nthe problem: $g^{-1}, (\\dot g/g)^{-1}$ and $\\omega^{-1}$ where $\\omega$ is the\nenergy difference between the two levels of the detector at which the spectrum\nis probed.

Specific\nmeaning can be stabilized, for example, in social institutions, but all meaning\narises from a horizon of possible meanings. Using Luhmann's (1984) social\nsystems theory and Rosen's (1985) theory of anticipatory systems, I submit\nequations for modeling the processing of meaning in inter-human communication.\nFirst, a self-referential system can use a model of itself for the\nanticipation.

On the substrates under consideration we find a similar\ndistribution of single, bi- and few layer graphene and graphite flakes as with\nconventional SiO$_2$ substrates. The optical contrast $C$ of a single graphene\nlayer on any of those substrates is determined by calculating the optical\nproperties of a two-dimensional metallic sheet on the surface of a dielectric,\nwhich yields values between $C=$ ~- 1.5% (G/TiO$_2$) and $C=$ ~- 8.8%\n(G/CaF$_2$). This contrast is in reasonable agreement with experimental data\nand is sufficient to make identification by an optical microscope possible. The\ngraphene layers cover the crystalline substrate in a carpet-like mode and the\nheight of single layer graphene on any of the crystalline substrates as\ndetermined by atomic force microscopy is $d_{SLG}=0.34$ nm and thus much\nsmaller than on SiO$_2$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2009 15:32:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

We report on our analysis of the Chandra\nobservation and evaluate these hypotheses based on our results. Abell 3120\nshows X-ray emission extending 158 kpc, well beyond the central galaxy. The\nspatial distribution of X-rays in the core more closely follows the radio\nemission showing a jet-like structure extending to the north that is misaligned\nwith the stellar light distribution of the central galaxy. At larger radii the\nX-ray emission is aligned with the SE-NW running axis of the galaxy\ndistribution in the cluster core. Modeling the X-ray spectrum excludes purely\nnon-thermal emission. The emission weighted temperature is 1.93 - 2.19 keV and\nthe 0.3 - 10 keV luminosity is 1.23$\\times10^{43}$ ergs s$^{-1}$. Abell 3120\nappears to be a poor cluster with Virgo and MKW 4 as peers. The best fitting\nmodel consists of a thermal component and a second component that may be either\nthermal or non-thermal, with luminosity 25% of the total X-ray luminosity.\nWhile, a more detailed spatial-spectral search failed to detect a central AGN,\nthere is some evidence for an extended hard X-ray component. Cooler gas, 1.28 -\n1.80 was detected in the central 20 kpc. The second thermal component\nmarginally requires a higher redshift, >0.12, which may be due to a second\ncluster in the rich surrounding environment consisting of nearly a thousand\ncatalogued galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2009 15:40:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}
