It has been used to model all a wide variety of binary and\ntriple lens systems, but it is designed to efficiently model high-magnification\nplanetary microlensing events, because these are, by far, the most challenging\nevents to model. It is designed to be efficient enough to handle microlensing\nevents with more than two lens masses and lens orbital motion. This method uses\na polar coordinate integration grid with a smaller grid spacing in the radial\ndirection than in the angular direction, and it employs an integration scheme\nspecifically designed to handle limb darkened sources. I present tests that\nshow that these features achieve second order accuracy for the light curves of\na number of high-magnification planetary events. They improve the precision of\nthe calculations by a factor of >100 compared to first order integration\nschemes with the same grid spacing in both directions (for a fixed number of\ngrid points). This method also includes a Metropolis algorithm chi^2\nminimization method that allows the jump function to vary in a way that allows\nquick convergence to chi^2 minima. Finally, I introduce a global parameter\nspace search strategy that allows a blind search of parameter space for light\ncurve models without requiring chi^2 minimization over a large grid of fixed\nparameters. Instead, the parameter space is explored on a grid of initial\nconditions for a set of chi^2 minimizations using the full parameter space.\nWhile this method may be faster than methods that find the chi^2 minima over a\nlarge grid of parameters, I argue that the main strength of this method is for\nevents with the signals of multiple planets, where a much higher dimensional\nparameter space must be explored to find the correct light curve model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Nov 2009 14:24:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 2010 21:01:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

However, no such results are known for the Gaussian\nfunction, the preferred kernel in machine learning and several engineering\nproblems. We introduce and analyze in this paper a new algorithm for\napproximating functions using translates of Gaussian functions with varying\ntension parameters. At heart it employs the strategy for nonlinear\napproximation of DeVore and Ron, but it selects kernels by a method that is not\nstraightforward. The crux of the difficulty lies in the necessity to vary the\ntension parameter in the Gaussian function spatially according to local\ninformation about the approximand: error analysis of Gaussian approximation\nschemes with varying tension are, by and large, an elusive target for\napproximators. We show that our algorithm is suitably optimal in the sense that\nit provides approximation rates similar to other established nonlinear\nmethodologies like spline and wavelet approximations.

While active modulation of the intensity of the laser pulses is\nan effective way of preparing decoy states in principle, in practice passive\npreparation might be desirable in some scenarios. Typical passive schemes\ninvolve parametric down-conversion. More recently, it has been shown that phase\nrandomized weak coherent pulses (WCP) can also be used for the same purpose [M.\nCurty {\\it et al.}, Opt. Lett. {\\bf 34}, 3238 (2009).] This proposal requires\nonly linear optics together with a simple threshold photon detector, which\nshows the practical feasibility of the method. Most importantly, the resulting\nsecret key rate is comparable to the one delivered by an active decoy state\nsetup with an infinite number of decoy settings. In this paper we extend these\nresults, now showing specifically the analysis for other practical scenarios\nwith different light sources and photo-detectors. In particular, we consider\nsources emitting thermal states, phase randomized WCP, and strong coherent\nlight in combination with several types of photo-detectors, like, for instance,\nthreshold photon detectors, photon number resolving detectors, and classical\nphoto-detectors. Our analysis includes as well the effect that detection\ninefficiencies and noise in the form of dark counts shown by current threshold\ndetectors might have on the final secret ket rate.

The light and color curves display\nvariability in all of them. The light curves are complex and suggest multiple\nperiods, changing periods, and/or changing amplitudes, which are attributed to\npulsation. A dominant period has been determined for each and found to be in\nthe range of ~150 d for the coolest (G8) to 35-40 d for the warmest (F3). A\nclear, linear inverse relationship has been found in the sample between the\npulsation period and the effective temperature and also an inverse linear\nrelationship between the amplitude of light variation and the effective\ntemperature. These are consistent with the expectation for a pulsating post-AGB\nstar evolving toward higher temperature at constant luminosity. The published\nspectral energy distributions and mid-infrared images show these objects to\nhave cool (200 K), detached dust shells and published models imply that\nintensive mass loss ended a few thousand years ago. The detection of periods as\nlong as 150 d in these requires a revision in the published post-AGB evolution\nmodels that couple the pulsation period to the mass loss rate and that assume\nthat intensive mass loss ended when the pulsation period had decreased to 100\nd. This revision will have the effect of extending the time scale for the early\nphases of post-AGB evolution. It appears that real time evolution in the\npulsation periods of individual objects may be detectable on the time scale of\ntwo decades.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Nov 2009 03:42:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

It is shown in this paper that by using\northogonal signaling on frequency selective fading channels, the cooperative\nNash bargaining (NB)-based precoding games for multi-user systems, which aim at\nmaximizing the information rates of all users, are simplified to the\ncorresponding cooperative resource allocation games. The latter provides\nadditional practically desired simplifications to transmitter design and\nsignificantly reduces the overhead during user cooperation. The complexity of\nthe corresponding precoding/resource allocation games, however, depends on the\nconstraints imposed on the users. If only spectral mask constraints are\npresent, the corresponding cooperative NB problem can be formulated as a convex\noptimization problem and solved efficiently in a distributed manner using dual\ndecomposition based algorithm. However, the NB problem is non-convex if total\npower constraints are also imposed on the users. In this case, the complexity\nassociate with finding the NB solution is unacceptably high. Therefore, the\nmulti-user systems are categorized into bandwidth- and power-dominant based on\na bottleneck resource, and different manners of cooperation are developed for\neach type of systems for the case of two-users. Such classification guarantees\nthat the solution obtained in each case is Pareto-optimal and actually can be\nidentical to the optimal solution, while the complexity is significantly\nreduced. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed\ncooperative precoding/resource allocation strategies and the reduced complexity\nof the proposed algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Nov 2009 09:50:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The main goal of the paper is to study the connection between these\ntwo frameworks. In the case of directed information theory, we stress the\nimportance of Kramer's causal conditioning. This type of conditioning is\nnecessary not only in the definition of the directed information but also for\nhandling causal side information. We also show how directed information\ndecomposes into the sum of two measures, the first one related to Schreiber's\ntransfer entropy quantifies the dynamical aspects of causality, whereas the\nsecond one, termed instantaneous information exchange, quantifies the\ninstantaneous aspect of causality. After having recalled the definition of\nGranger causality, we establish its connection with directed information\ntheory. The connection is particularly studied in the Gaussian case, showing\nthat Geweke's measures of Granger causality correspond to the transfer entropy\nand the instantaneous information exchange. This allows to propose an\ninformation theoretic formulation of Granger causality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Nov 2009 14:47:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2009 17:24:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 8 Dec 2010 00:48:56 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2011 05:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-02"}
