We have obtained high resolution X-ray spectra with\nChandra and find that the system is very active and similar to coronal sources,\nhaving emission typical of magnetically confined plasma: a broad temperature\ndistribution with a hot component and significant high energy continuum; narrow\nemission lines from H- and He-like ions, as well as a range of Fe ions, and\nrelative luminosity, L_x/L_bol = 0.001. Density, while poorly constrained, is\nconsistent with the low density limits as determined from Mg XI and Ne IX\nemission lines. Coronal elemental abundances are sub-Solar, with Ne being the\nhighest at about 0.4 times Solar. We find a possible trend in Trapezium hot\nplasmas towards low relative abundances of Fe, O, and Ne, which is hard to\nexplain in terms of the dust depletion scenarios of low-mass young stars.\nVariability was unusually low relative to other coronally active stars. The\nemission is similar to post main-sequence G-stars. Coronal structures could be\ncompact or comparable to the dimensions of the stellar radii. We conclude that\nthe X-rays in theta 1 Ori E are generated by a convective dynamo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Nov 2009 18:48:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

In high-Tc cuprate\nsuperconductors above Tc, an energy gap called the pseudogap exists, and is\ncontroversially attributed either to pre-formed superconducting pairs, which\nwould exhibit particle-hole symmetry, or to competing phases which would\ntypically break it. Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) studies suggest that\nthe pseudogap stems from lattice translational symmetry breaking and is\nassociated with a different characteristic spectrum for adding or removing\nelectrons (particle-hole asymmetry). However, no signature of either spatial or\nenergy symmetry breaking of the pseudogap has previously been observed by\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Here we report ARPES data\nfrom Bi2201 which reveals both particle-hole symmetry breaking and dramatic\nspectral broadening indicative of spatial symmetry breaking without long range\norder, upon crossing through T* into the pseudogap state. This symmetry\nbreaking is found in the dominant region of the momentum space for the\npseudogap, around the so-called anti-node near the Brillouin zone boundary.

One\nof the main questions in this area is the \\emph{parallel repetition question}:\nIf the game is played $\\ell$ times in parallel, does the maximum winning\nprobability decay exponentially in $\\ell$? In the classical setting, this\nquestion was answered in the affirmative by Raz. More recently the question\narose whether the decay is of the form $(1-\\Theta(\\eps))^\\ell$ where $1-\\eps$\nis the value of the game and $\\ell$ is the number of repetitions. This question\nis known as the \\emph{strong parallel repetition question} and was motivated by\nits connections to the unique games conjecture. It was resolved by Raz who\nshowed that strong parallel repetition does \\emph{not} hold, even in the very\nspecial case of games known as XOR games.\n  This opens the question whether strong parallel repetition holds in the case\nwhen the provers share entanglement. Evidence for this is provided by the\nbehavior of XOR games, which have strong (in fact \\emph{perfect}) parallel\nrepetition, and by the recently proved strong parallel repetition of linear\nunique games. A similar question was open for games with so-called\nnon-signaling provers. Here the best known parallel repetition theorem is due\nto Holenstein, and is of the form $(1-\\Theta(\\eps^2))^\\ell$.\n  We show that strong parallel repetition holds neither with entangled provers\nnor with non-signaling provers. In particular we obtain that Holenstein's bound\nis tight. Along the way we also provide a tight characterization of the\nasymptotic behavior of the entangled value under parallel repetition of unique\ngames in terms of a semidefinite program.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Nov 2009 20:28:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-03"}

Further understanding of what these galaxies\nreveal about cosmology and the small scale structure of dark matter relies in\nlarge part on a more detailed interpretation of their internal kinematics. This\narticle discusses a likelihood formalism that extracts important quantities\nfrom the kinematic data, including the amplitude of rotation, proper motion,\nand the mass distribution. In the simplest model the projected error on the\nrotational amplitude is shown to be $\\sim 0.5 $ km s$^{-1}$ with $\\sim 10^3$\nstars from either classical or ultra-faint satellites. The galaxy Sculptor is\nanalyzed for the presence of a rotational signal; no significant detection of\nrotation is found, and given this result limits are derived on the Sculptor\nproper motion. A criteria for model selection is discussed that determines the\nparameters required to describe the dark matter halo density profiles and the\nstellar velocity anisotropy. Applied to four data sets with a wide range of\nvelocities, the likelihood is found to be more sensitive to variations in the\nslope of the dark matter density profile than variations in the velocity\nanisotropy. Models with variable radial velocity anisotropy are shown to be\npreferred relative to those in which this quantity is constant at all radii in\nthe galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2009 06:06:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

However, it still remains elusive on how to design these local\ninteractions among agents so as to achieve certain desired collective\nbehaviors. This paper aims to tackle this challenge and proposes a\ndivide-and-conquer approach to guarantee specified global behaviors through\nlocal coordination and control design for multi-agent systems. The basic idea\nis to decompose the requested global specification into subtasks for each\nindividual agent. It should be noted that the decomposition is not arbitrary.\nThe global specification should be decomposed in such a way that the fulfilment\nof these subtasks by each individual agent will imply the satisfaction of the\nglobal specification as a team. First, it is shown by a counterexample that not\nall specifications can be decomposed in this sense. Then, a natural follow-up\nquestion is what the necessary and sufficient condition should be for the\nproposed decomposability of a global specification. The main part of the paper\nis set to answer this question. The case of two cooperative agents is\ninvestigated first, and a necessary and sufficient condition is presented and\nproven. Later on, the result is generalized to the case of arbitrary finite\nnumber of agents, and a hierarchical algorithm is proposed, which is shown to\nbe a sufficient condition. Finally, a cooperative control scenario for a team\nof three robots is developed to illustrate the task decomposition procedure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2009 04:23:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2010 13:14:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 12 Jan 2011 02:58:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-13"}

The correction to the Newtonian potential on the\nbrane is proportional to $e^{-3 r \\beta/2}/r^2$, where $\\beta$ is the de Sitter\nparameter of the brane.

We prove that whenever the\njoint distribution $\\prob^{(X,Y)}$ admits such a model in one direction, e.g.\n$Y=f(X)+N, N \\independent X$, it does not admit the reversed model\n$X=g(Y)+\\tilde N, \\tilde N \\independent Y$ as long as the model is chosen in a\ngeneric way.

However, the role of encounters in\nother cluster environments is less known. We investigate the effect of the\nencounter-induced disc-mass loss in different cluster environments. Starting\nfrom an ONC-like cluster we vary the cluster size and density to determine the\ncorrelation of collision time scale and disc-mass loss. We use the NBODY6++\ncode to model the dynamics of these clusters and analyze the effect of\nstar-disc encounters. We find that the disc-mass loss depends strongly on the\ncluster density but remains rather unaffected by the size of the stellar\npopulation. The essential outcome of the simulations are: i) Even in clusters\nfour times sparser than the ONC the effect of encounters is still apparent. ii)\nThe density of the ONC itself marks a threshold: in less dense and less massive\nclusters it is the massive stars that dominate the encounter-induced disc-mass\nloss whereas in denser and more massive clusters the low-mass stars play the\nmajor role for the disc mass removal. It seems that in the central regions of\nyoung dense star clusters -- the common sites of star formation -- stellar\nencounters do affect the evolution of the protoplanetary discs. With higher\ncluster density low-mass stars become more heavily involved in this process.\nThis finding allows for the extrapolation towards extreme stellar systems: in\ncase of the Arches cluster one would expect stellar encounters to destroy the\ndiscs of most of the low- and high-mass stars in several hundred thousand\nyears, whereas intermediate mass stars are able to retain to some extant their\ndiscs even under these harsh environmental conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2009 11:49:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

So as to solve this problem, we propose a\npersonalised platform (according to the actor: project group, student or tutor)\nwhich gives information to monitor activities and supports the acquisition and\ntransfer of expertise. This platform is meant for the complex educational\ncontext of project-based learning. Indeed, as for the majority of project-based\nlearning activities, the articulation conceptualisation-experiment is an\nimportant part of the process. The originality of our approach relies on also\nsupporting the articulation between action (experiment or conceptualisation)\nand reflection. This approach so improves the acquisition of complex skills\n(e.g. management, communication and collaboration), which requires a\nbehavioural evolution. We aim at making the students become able ?to learn to\nlearn' and evolve according to contexts. We facilitate their ability to have a\ncritical analysis of their actions according to the situations they encounter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2009 13:31:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-03"}

An important\nchemical potential shift which strongly evolves with temperature is evidenced.\nIn the framework of the exciton condensate phase, the detailed temperature\ndependence of the associated order parameter is extracted. Having a\nmean-field-like behaviour at low temperature, it exhibits a non-zero value\nabove the transition, interpreted as the signature of strong excitonic\nfluctuations, reminiscent of the pseudo-gap phase of high temperature\nsuperconductors.

A two-photon state, produced in\na spontaneous parametric down conversion process, is prepared in a maximally\nentangled polarization state. A birefringent double-slit is illuminated by one\nof the down-converted photons, and it acts as a single-photon two-qubits\ncontrolled not gate that couples the polarization with the transversal momentum\nof these photons. The other photon, that acts as a which-path marker, is sent\nthrough a Mach-Zehnder-like interferometer. When the interferometer is\npartially unbalanced, it behaves as a controlled source of decoherence for\npolarization states of down-converted photons.
