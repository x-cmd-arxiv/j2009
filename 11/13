Here we present numerical simulations of this process in a static\nisothermal potential. Simple spherically symmetric models of SMBH feedback at\nthe Eddington luminosity can successfully explain the $M_{\\rm bh} - \\sigma$ and\nnuclear cluster mass $M_{\\rm NC}-\\sigma$ correlations, as well as why larger\nbulges host SMBHs while smaller ones host nuclear star clusters. However these\nmodels do not specify how SMBHs feed on infalling gas whilst simultaneously\nproducing feedback that drives gas out of the galaxy.\n  More complex models with rotation and/or anisotropic feedback allow SMBHs to\nfeed via a disc or regions not exposed to SMBH winds, but in these more\nrealistic cases it is not clear why a robust $M_{\\rm bh} - \\sigma$ relation\nshould be established. In fact, some of the model predictions contradict\nobservations. For example, an isotropic SMBH wind impacting on a disc (rather\nthan a shell) of aspect ratio $H/R \\ll 1$ requires the SMBH mass to be larger\nby a factor $\\sim R/H$, which is opposite to what is observed. We conclude that\nunderstanding how a SMBH feeds is as important a piece of the puzzle as\nunderstanding how its feedback affects its host galaxy.\n  Finally, we note that in aspherical cases the SMBH outflows induce\ndifferential motions in the bulge. This may pump turbulence that is known to\nhinder star formation in star forming regions. SMBH feedback thus may not only\ndrive gas out of the bulge but also reduce the fraction of gas turned into\nstars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2009 17:37:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Observations of stellar occultations by\nthe Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer onboard the Cassini spacecraft\nhave yielded ~40 accurate and precise measurements of the radial position of\nthe edges of all of these gaps and ringlets. These data reveal suggestive\npatterns in the shapes of many of the gap edges: the outer edges of the 5 gaps\nwithout ringlets are circular to within 1 km, while the inner edges of 6 of the\ngaps are eccentric, with apsidal precession rates consistent with those\nexpected for eccentric orbits near each edge. Intriguingly, the pattern speeds\nof these eccentric inner gap edges, together with that of the eccentric Huygens\nringlet,form a series with a characteristic spacing of 0.06 degrees/day. The\ntwo gaps with non-eccentric inner edges lie near first-order Inner Lindblad\nResonances (ILRs) with moons. One such edge is close to the 5:4 ILR with\nPrometheus. The other resonantly confined edge is the outer edge of the B ring,\nwhich lies near the 2:1 Mimas ILR. Detailed investigation of the B-ring-edge\ndata confirm the presence of an m=2 perturbation on the B-ring edge, but also\nsuggest that this pattern moves or librates relative to Mimas. The B-ring edge\nalso has an m=1 component that rotates around the planet at a rate close to the\nexpected apsidal precession rate. The pattern speeds of the eccentric edges in\nthe Cassini Division can potentially be generated from various combinations of\nthe pattern speeds of structures observed on the edge of the B ring. We\ntherefore suggest that the locations of most of the gaps in the Cassini\nDivision may be determined by resonances involving a combination of\nperturbations from Mimas and the massive edge of the B ring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2009 18:03:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2009 15:34:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-07"}

This mechanism is unveiled by means of a periodic\norbit analysis of the invariant chaotic attractor for two model dynamical\nsystems with phase spaces of low dimensionality, and seems to depend heavily on\nthe chaotic dynamics in the invariant set. We also described, for these\nsystems, the blowout bifurcation (for which the chaotic set as a whole loses\ntransversal stability) and its relation with the situation where the effects of\nUDV are the most intense.

The X-ray-selected AGN sample and associated optical follow-up are\ndrawn from the SEXSI program. Mid-infrared data in these fields are derived\nfrom Spitzer imaging, and mid-infrared AGN selection is accomplished primarily\nthrough application of the IRAC color-color AGN `wedge' selection technique.\nNearly all X-ray sources in these fields which exhibit clear spectroscopic\nsignatures of AGN activity have mid-infrared colors consistent with IRAC AGN\nselection. These are predominantly the most luminous X-ray sources. X-ray\nsources that lack high-ionization and/or broad lines in their optical spectra\nare far less likely to be selected as AGN by mid-infrared color selection\ntechniques. The fraction of X-ray sources identified as AGN in the mid-infrared\nincreases monotonically as the X-ray luminosity increases. Conversely, only 22%\nof mid-infrared-selected AGN are detected at X-ray energies in the moderately\ndeep (~100 ks) Chandra data. We hypothesize that the IRAC AGN that lack X-ray\ndetections are predominantly high-luminosity AGN that are obscured and/or lie\nat high redshift. A stacking analysis of X-ray-undetected sources shows that\nobjects in the mid-infrared AGN selection wedge have average X-ray fluxes in\nthe 2-8 keV band three times higher than sources that fall outside the wedge.\nTheir X-ray spectra are also harder. It is evident from this comparative study\nthat in order to create a complete, unbiased census of supermassive black hole\ngrowth and evolution, a combination of sensitive infrared, X-ray and hard X-ray\nselection is required. We conclude by discussing what samples will be provided\nby upcoming survey missions such as WISE, eROSITA, and NuSTAR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2009 19:10:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

The second parameter phenomenon\nacknowledges that metallicity alone is not enough to describe the HB morphology\nof all GCs. In particular, the outer Galactic halo contains GCs with redder HBs\nat a given metallicity than are found inside the Solar circle. Thus, at least a\nsecond parameter is required to characterize HB morphology. Here we analyze the\nmedian color difference between the HB and the red giant branch (RGB), d(V-I),\nmeasured from HST ACS photometry of 60 GCs within ~20 kpc of the Galactic\nCenter. Analysis of this homogeneous data set reveals that, after the influence\nof metallicity has been removed, the correlation between d(V-I) and age is\nstronger than that of any other parameter considered. Expanding the sample to\ninclude HST photometry of the 6 most distant Galactic GCs lends additional\nsupport to the correlation between d(V-I) and age.

This simple theorem, previously noted but published only\nrelatively recently by Masanes, Acin and Gisin, has fundamental implications\nnot entirely appreciated. Firstly, nothing can be concluded about the\nontological assumptions of locality or determinism independently of each other\n-- it is possible to reproduce quantum mechanics with deterministic models that\nviolate locality as well as indeterministic models that satisfy locality. On\nthe other hand, the operational assumption of signal locality is an empirically\ntestable (and well-tested) consequence of relativity. Thus Bell inequality\nviolations imply that we can trust that some events are fundamentally\n\\emph{unpredictable}, even if we cannot trust that they are indeterministic.\nThis result grounds the quantum-mechanical prohibition of arbitrarily accurate\npredictions on the assumption of no superluminal signalling, regardless of any\npostulates of quantum mechanics.

As it is unpractical to follow every particle to its end,\nparticles below a certain energy ($E_{Cut}$) are discarded from the simulation.\nIn this article we study in detail the influence that this cut has on the total\nenergy deposited in the atmosphere by the particle cascade in AIRES\nsimulations. The energy deposit is directly related to the emission of\nfluorescence light and is critical for the accurate simulation of shower\nsignals in fluorescence detectors. Not correcting for the discarded particles\nintroduces a bias on several shower observables related to the energy deposit\nthat can range from 3 to 30% or more depending on the $E_{Cut}$ value used. A\nprescription for the correct treatment of these particles is proposed, and the\nresulting corrections to the total energy deposit are addressed, including a\nnew universal parametrization of the mean energy deposit per particle. The low\nenergy cut is introduced in the simulations to reduce the required CPU time per\nshower at the expense of simulation accuracy. We find that a 0.4 MeV cut for\nelectrons and 0.9 MeV cut for gammas is an adequate compromise, and that the\nproposed prescription is capablable of removing the bias introduced by this\ncut. The prescription is independent of the energy cut value and can be used to\ncorrect and compare simulations made with different energy cuts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2009 04:49:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-16"}

This provides a theoretical justification of the experimental\nexponent discrepancy observed by Narayan and Saniee between traffic loads in\nGromov-hyperbolic networks from the Rocketfuel data base and synthetic\nEuclidean lattice networks.

While existing PHY security literature answered the\nquestion ``what are the link-level secrecy rate gains from cooperation?'', this\npaper attempts to answer the question of ``how to achieve those gains in a\npractical decentralized wireless network and in the presence of a cost for\ninformation exchange?''. For this purpose, we model the PHY security\ncooperation problem as a coalitional game with non-transferable utility and\npropose a distributed algorithm for coalition formation. Through the proposed\nalgorithm, the wireless users can cooperate and self-organize into disjoint\nindependent coalitions, while maximizing their secrecy rate taking into account\nthe security costs during information exchange. We analyze the resulting\ncoalitional structures for both decode-and-forward and amplify-and-forward\ncooperation and study how the users can adapt the network topology to\nenvironmental changes such as mobility. Through simulations, we assess the\nperformance of the proposed algorithm and show that, by coalition formation\nusing decode-and-forward, the average secrecy rate per user is increased of up\nto 25.3 % and 24.4 % (for a network with 45 users) relative to the\nnon-cooperative and amplify-and-forward cases, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2009 08:37:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-16"}

Several significant midrange\nperiodicities ($\\sim$175, 133, 113, 104, 84, 63 days) are detected in sunspot\nactivity. Most of the periodicities in sunspot numbers generally agree with\nthose of sunspot areas during the solar cycle 23. The study reveals that the\nperiodic variations in the northern and southern hemispheres of the Sun show a\nkind of asymmetrical behavior. Periodicities of $\\sim$175 days and $\\sim$133\ndays are highly significant in the sunspot data of northern hemisphere showing\nconsistency with the findings of Lean (1990) during solar cycles 12-21.

The analysis of solar flare index data of the same\ntime interval does not show any significant peak. The different periodic\nbehavior of sunspot and flare activity can be understood in the light of\nhypothesis proposed by Ballester et al.

Aims: Based on new high-resolution optical spectroscopic\ndata from 1999 and 2007 associated to a photometric analysis, the aim of this\nwork is to provide a deep spectroscopic description and a new set of parameters\nfor this unclassified southern B[e] star and its interstellar extinction.\nMethods: From our high-resolution optical spectroscopic data separated by 8\nyears, we perform a detailed spectral description, presenting the variations\nseen and discussing their possible origin. We derive the interstellar\nextinction to HD 50138 by taking the influences of the circumstellar matter in\nthe form of dust and an ionized disk into account. Based on photometric data\nfrom the literature and the new Hipparcos distance, we obtain a revised set of\nparameters for HD 50138. Results: Because of the spectral changes, we\ntentatively suggest that a new shell phase could have taken place prior to our\nobservations in 2007. We find a color excess value of E(B-V) = 0.08 mag, and\nfrom the photometric analysis, we suggest that HD 50138 is a B6-7 III-V star.
