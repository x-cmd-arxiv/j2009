This is the only multi-planet system\ndiscovered by any method with measured masses for the star and both planets. In\naddition to the signatures of two planets, this event also exhibits a\nmicrolensing parallax signature and finite source effects that provide a direct\nmeasure of the masses of the star and planets, and the expected brightness of\nthe host star is confirmed by Keck AO imaging, yielding masses of M_* =\n0.51(+0.05-0.04) M_sun, M_b = 231+-19 M_earth, M_c = 86+-7 M_earth. The\nSaturn-analog planet in this system had a planetary light curve deviation that\nlasted for 11 days, and as a result, the effects of the orbital motion are\nvisible in the microlensing light curve. We find that four of the six orbital\nparameters are tightly constrained and that a fifth parameter, the orbital\nacceleration, is weakly constrained. No orbital information is available for\nthe Jupiter-analog planet, but its presence helps to constrain the orbital\nmotion of the Saturn-analog planet. Assuming co-planar orbits, we find an\norbital eccentricity of eccentricity = 0.15 (+0.17-0.10) and an orbital\ninclination of i = 64 (+4-7) deg. The 95% confidence level lower limit on the\ninclination of i > 49 deg. implies that this planetary system can be detected\nand studied via radial velocity measurements using a telescope of >30m\naperture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2009 00:53:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2009 00:13:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2010 20:38:59 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 2010 21:00:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

We give an\naffirmative answer to an old question of G. Rauzy by exhibiting a class of\nwords whose Abelian complexity is everywhere equal to 3. We also investigate\nlinks between Abelian complexity and the existence of Abelian powers. Using van\nder Waerden's Theorem, we show that any minimal subshift having bounded Abelian\ncomplexity contains Abelian k-powers for every positive integer k. In the case\nof Sturmian words we prove something stronger: For every Sturmian word w and\npositive integer k, each sufficiently long factor of w begins in an Abelian\nk-power.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Nov 2009 20:54:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-26"}

The temporal\nvariation of the polarization vector is apparently erratic in most blazars,\nwhile several objects occasionally exhibited systematic variations, for\nexample, an increase of the polarization degree associated with a flare of the\ntotal flux. We assume that the observed polarization vector is a superposition\nof distinct two components, a long-term trend and a short-term variation\ncomponent responsible for short flares. Our Bayesian model estimates the\nlong-term trend which satisfies the condition that the total flux correlates\nwith the polarized flux of the short-term component.

Specifically, a multi-antenna SU transmitter applies\nCB to suppress the interference to the PU receivers as well as enhance the\ncorresponding SU-link performance. In this paper, for a\nmultiple-input-single-output (MISO) SU channel coexisting with a\nsingle-input-single-output (SISO) PU channel, we propose a new and practical\nparadigm for designing CB based on the finite-rate cooperative feedback from\nthe PU receiver to the SU transmitter. Specifically, the PU receiver\ncommunicates to the SU transmitter the quantized SU-to-PU channel direction\ninformation (CDI) for computing the SU transmit beamformer, and the\ninterference power control (IPC) signal that regulates the SU transmission\npower according to the tolerable interference margin at the PU receiver. Two CB\nalgorithms based on cooperative feedback are proposed: one restricts the SU\ntransmit beamformer to be orthogonal to the quantized SU-to-PU channel\ndirection and the other relaxes such a constraint. In addition, cooperative\nfeedforward of the SU CDI from the SU transmitter to the PU receiver is\nexploited to allow more efficient cooperative feedback. The outage\nprobabilities of the SU link for different CB and cooperative\nfeedback/feedforward algorithms are analyzed, from which the optimal\nbit-allocation tradeoff between the CDI and IPC feedback is characterized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2009 05:09:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Oct 2010 09:48:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-18"}

We therefore propose a (restricted) logical\ntheory over relations as a language for specifying such notions. Our\nspecification logic is further characterized by an ability to explicitly treat\nbinding in object languages. Once such a logic is fixed, a natural next\nquestion is how we might prove theorems about specifications written in it. We\npropose to use a second logic, called a reasoning logic, for this purpose. A\nsatisfactory reasoning logic should be able to completely encode the\nspecification logic. Associated with the specification logic are various\nnotions of binding: for quantifiers within formulas, for eigenvariables within\nsequents, and for abstractions within terms. To provide a natural treatment of\nthese aspects, the reasoning logic must encode binding structures as well as\ntheir associated notions of scope, free and bound variables, and\ncapture-avoiding substitution. Further, to support arguments about provability,\nthe reasoning logic should possess strong mechanisms for constructing proofs by\ninduction and co-induction. We provide these capabilities here by using a logic\ncalled G which represents relations over lambda-terms via definitions of atomic\njudgments, contains inference rules for induction and co-induction, and\nincludes a special generic quantifier. We show how provability in the\nspecification logic can be transparently encoded in G.

Notwithstanding, several\nobservational evidences and deeper theoretical insights reveal that accretion\nand outflow/jet are strongly correlated. We model an advective disk-outflow\ncoupled dynamics, incorporating explicitly the vertical flux. Inter-connecting\ndynamics of outflow and accretion essentially upholds the conservation laws. We\ninvestigate the properties of the disk-outflow surface and its strong\ndependence on the rotation parameter of the black hole. The energetics of the\ndisk-outflow strongly depend on the mass, accretion rate and spin of the black\nholes. The model clearly shows that the outflow power extracted from the disk\nincreases strongly with the spin of the black hole, inferring that the power of\nthe observed astrophysical jets has a proportional correspondence with the spin\nof the central object. In case of blazars (BL Lacs and Flat Spectrum Radio\nQuasars), most of their emission are believed to be originated from their jets.\nIt is observed that BL Lacs are relatively low luminous than Flat Spectrum\nRadio Quasars (FSRQs). The luminosity might be linked to the power of the jet,\nwhich in turn reflects that the nuclear regions of the BL Lac objects have a\nrelatively low spinning black hole compared to that in the case of FSRQ. If the\nextreme gravity is the source to power strong outflows and jets, then the spin\nof the black hole, perhaps, might be the fundamental parameter to account for\nthe observed astrophysical processes in an accretion powered system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2009 15:10:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2010 17:19:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}
