After the\nexclusion of point sources with L_X > 2 x 10^{35} erg/s (0.3-6 keV), we\ninvestigate the morphology and spectrum of the residual X-ray emission. This\nresidual emission has a soft X-ray spectrum which can be fitted with a\ntwo-temperature thermal model, with kT = 0.2 keV and 0.6 keV. The soft X-ray\nsurface brightness distribution shows a strong correlation with FUV emission,\nindicative of a close connection between recent star-formation activity and the\nproduction of soft X-rays. Within 3.5 kpc of the nucleus of M33, the soft X-ray\nand FUV surface brightness distributions exhibit similar radial profiles. This\nimplies that the ratio of the soft X-ray luminosity (0.3-2.0 keV) to the star\nformation rate (SFR) per unit disk area remains fairly constant within this\ninner disk region. We derive a value for this ratio of 1-1.5 x 10^{39}\n(erg/s)/(M_sun/yr), consistent with previous studies. In the same region, the\nratio of soft X-ray luminosity to stellar mass (derived from K-band photometry)\nis 4 x 10^{28} erg/s/M_sun, a factor of 5-10 higher than is typical of dwarf\nelliptical galaxies, suggesting that 10-20% of the unresolved emission seen in\nM33 may originate in its old stellar population. The remainder of the soft\nX-ray emission is equally split between two spatial components, one which\nclosely traces the spiral arms of the galaxy and the other more smoothly\ndistributed across the inner disk of M33. The former must represent a highly\nclumped low-filling factor component linked to sites of recent or ongoing star\nformation, whereas the distribution of the latter gives few clues as to its\nexact origin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2009 16:22:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The\nmagnetopause is a strong shear layer with rapid changes in the azimuthal\nvelocity, the density, and the magnetic field over a short radial distance and\nthus the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability may be important. The plasma\ndynamics is treated using non-relativistic, compressible (isentropic)\nmagnetohydrodynamics. It is necessary to include the displacement current in\norder that plasma wave velocities remain less than the speed of light. We focus\nmainly on the case of a star with an aligned dipole magnetic field so that the\nmagnetic field is axial in the disc midplane and perpendicular to the disc flow\nvelocity. However, we also give results for cases where the magnetic field is\nat an arbitrary angle to the flow velocity. For the aligned dipole case the\nmagnetopause is most unstable for KH waves propagating in the azimuthal\ndirection perpendicular to the magnetic field which tends to stabilize waves\npropagating parallel to it. The wave phase velocity is that of the disc matter.\nA quasi-linear theory of the saturation of the instability leads to a\nwavenumber ($k$) power spectrum $\\propto k^{-1}$ of the density and temperature\nfluctuations of the magnetopause, and it gives the mass accretion and angular\nmomentum inflow rates across the magnetopause.

These diffuse radio sources are rare, having so far been\nfound only in about 30 clusters of galaxies, suggesting that particular\nconditions are needed to form and maintain them. It is interesting to\ninvestigate the presence of radio halos in close pairs of interacting clusters\nin order to possibly clarify their origin in relation to the evolutionary state\nof the merger. In this work, we study the case of the close pair of galaxy\nclusters A399 and A401. A401 is already known to contain a faint radio halo,\nwhile a hint of diffuse emission in A399 has been suggested based on the NVSS.\nTo confirm this possibility, we analyzed deeper Very Large Array observations\nat 1.4 GHz of this cluster. We find that the central region of A399 is\npermeated by a diffuse low-surface brightness radio emission that we classify\nas a radio halo with a linear size of about 570 kpc and a central brightness of\n0.3 micro-Jy/arcsec^2. Indeed, given their comparatively small projected\ndistance of about 3 Mpc, the pair of galaxy clusters A401 and A399 can be\nconsidered as the first example of double radio halo system. The discovery of\nthis double halo is extraordinary given the rarity of these radio sources in\ngeneral and given that current X-ray data seem to suggest that the two clusters\nare still in a pre-merger state. Therefore, the origin of the double radio halo\nis likely to be attributed to the individual merging histories of each cluster\nseparately, rather than to the result of a close encounter between the two\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2009 16:27:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Using of SSA enabled us to determine nonlinear trends in zenith\ndelay, and also to study variations in the amplitude and the phase of the\nseasonal components with time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2009 19:06:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-19"}

In our simulations, the polymer films are very thin\n(approx. 3 nm), and the solid walls are connected to a thermostat at a short\ndistance from the polymer slab. Under these circumstances we find that\nfrictional heating effects are not important, and the effective temperature in\nthe polymer film is always close to the thermostat temperature. In the first\nsetup (a), for hydrocarbons with molecular lengths from 60 to 1400 carbon\natoms, the shear stresses are nearly independent of molecular length, but for\nthe shortest hydrocarbon C20H42 the frictional shear stress is lower. In all\ncases the frictional shear stress increases monotonically with the sliding\nvelocity.

It is shown\nthat thinking of a polycrystal with randomly oriented grains as an homogeneous\nand isotropic continuum when dealing with it as a dynamical medium, even in a\nscale much larger than the grain size, leads to gross errors. The polyhedral\nnature of grains influences the plastic flow in a radical manner, as the\nrelative velocity of adjacent grains is constrained to the common boundary\nplane, and only the in--plane shear stress contributes to their relative\nmotion. This constriction determines that the divergency of the velocity field\nof the material medium does not vanish, and plastic deformation necessarily\ninvolves grain volume variations, which can only be elastic. As this has a\nlimit, fracture follows as a necessary step of plastic flow.

Pronounced differences\nbetween the methods are exposed. Diagrams were created by comparing excitation\nclasses with H-beta line fluxes. The best methods are then compared to\npublished temperatures using the Zanstra method and assessed for their ability\nto reflect central star effective temperatures and evolution. As a result we\ncall for a clarification of the term `excitation class' according to the\ndifferent input parameters used. The first method, which we refer to as Exneb\nrelies purely on the ratios of certain key emission lines. The second method,\nwhich we refer to as Ex* includes modeling to create a continuous variable and,\nfor optically thick PNe in the Magellanic Clouds, is designed to relate more\nclosely to intrinsic stellar parameters. The third method, we refer to as Ex\n[OIII]/H-beta since the [OIII]/H-beta ratio is used in isolation to other\ntemperature diagnostics. Each of these methods is shown to have serious\ndrawbacks when used as an indicator for central star temperature. Finally, we\nsuggest a new method (Exrho) for estimating excitation class incorporating both\nthe [OIII]/H-beta and the HeII4686 /H-beta ratios. Although any attempt to\nprovide accurate central star temperatures using the excitation class derived\nfrom nebula lines will always be limited, we show that this new method provides\na substantial improvement over previous methods with better agreement to\ntemperatures derived through the Zanstra method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2009 02:29:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Mar 2010 01:34:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

We investigate\nthe evolution of this outburst with two-dimensional axisymmetric gasdynamical\ncalculations in which the cavities are inflated by relativistic cosmic rays.\nMany key observational features of the cavities and associated shocks are\nsuccessfully reproduced. The radial elongation of the cavities indicates that\ncosmic rays were injected into the cluster gas by a (jet) source moving out\nfrom the central AGN. AGN jets of this magnitude must be almost perfectly\nidentically bipolar. The relativistic momentum of a single jet would cause a\ncentral AGN black hole of mass 10^9 M_{sun} to recoil at ~6000 km s^{-1},\nexceeding kick velocities during black hole mergers, and be ejected from the\ncluster-center galaxy.

Deviations of the\ncluster gas from hydrostatic equilibrium are most pronounced during the early\ncavity evolution when the integrated cluster mass found from the observed gas\npressure gradient can have systematic errors near the cavities of ~10-30%. The\ncreation of the cavity with cosmic rays generates a long-lasting global cluster\nexpansion that reduces the total gas thermal energy below that received from\nthe cavity shock.

The error compensation procedure,\nfor a particular encoder, involves obtaining its error profile by calibrating\nit on a precision rotary table, training the neural network by using a part of\nthis data and then determining the corrected encoder angle by subtracting the\nANN-predicted error from the measured value of the encoder angle. Since it is\nnot guaranteed that all the resolvers will have exactly similar error profiles\nbecause of the inherent differences in their construction on a micro scale, the\nANN has been trained on one error profile at a time and the corresponding\nweight file is then used only for compensating the systematic error of this\nparticular encoder. The systematic nature of the error profile for each of the\nencoders has also been validated by repeated calibration of the encoders over a\nperiod of time and it was found that the error profiles of a particular encoder\nrecorded at different epochs show near reproducible behavior. The ANN-based\nerror compensation procedure has been implemented for 4 encoders by training\nthe ANN with their respective error profiles and the results indicate that the\naccuracy of encoders can be improved by nearly an order of magnitude from\nquoted values of ~6 arc-min to ~0.65 arc-min when their corresponding\nANN-generated weight files are used for determining the corrected encoder\nangle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2009 07:51:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

In the first of these examples, the number, $p$, of quantities being\nordered is sometimes only moderate in size; in the second it can be very large,\noften much greater than sample size. However, we show that in both types of\nproblem the conventional bootstrap can produce inconsistency. Moreover, the\nstandard $n$-out-of-$n$ bootstrap estimator of the distribution of an empirical\nrank may not converge in the usual sense; the estimator may converge in\ndistribution, but not in probability. Nevertheless, in many cases the bootstrap\ncorrectly identifies the support of the asymptotic distribution of ranks. In\nsome contemporary problems, bootstrap prediction intervals for ranks are\nparticularly long, and in this context, we also quantify the accuracy of\nbootstrap methods, showing that the standard bootstrap gets the order of\nmagnitude of the interval right, but not the constant multiplier of interval\nlength. The $m$-out-of-$n$ bootstrap can improve performance and produce\nstatistical consistency, but it requires empirical choice of $m$; we suggest a\ntuning solution to this problem. We show that in genomic examples, where it\nmight be expected that the standard, ``synchronous'' bootstrap will\nsuccessfully accommodate nonindependence of vector components, that approach\ncan produce misleading results. An ``independent component'' bootstrap can\novercome these difficulties, even in cases where components are not strictly\nindependent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2009 10:16:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-20"}

We propose a new approach to graph rewriting where nodes can be cloned\nzero, one or more times. A node can be cloned together with all its incident\nedges, with only its outgoing edges, with only its incoming edges or with none\nof its incident edges. We thus subsume previous works such as the\nsesqui-pushout, the heterogeneous pushout and the adaptive star grammars\napproaches. A rewrite rule is defined as a span where the right-hand and\nleft-hand sides are graphs while the interface is a polarized graph. A\npolarized graph is a graph endowed with some annotations on nodes. The way a\nnode is cloned is indicated by its polarization annotation. We use these\nannotations for designing graph transformation with polarized cloning. We show\nhow a clone of a node can be built according to the different possible\npolarizations and define a rewrite step as a final pullback complement followed\nby a pushout. This is called the polarized sesqui-pushout approach. We also\nprovide an algorithmic presentation of the proposed graph transformation with\npolarized cloning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2009 12:54:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2010 09:36:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2012 07:11:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-25"}

Corotation has two opposing effects: 1)\nthe caustic enhancement of the trailing side (TS) by aberration and retardation\n(AR), which squeezes the emission into a narrower phase interval; 2) the\nweakening of the TS caused by the asymmetry of curvature radiation about the\ndipole axis. Analysis of the radii of curvature of electron trajectories in the\ninertial observer's frame (IOF) enables these two effects to be considered\ntogether. We demonstrate that for dipolar magnetic field lines on the TS there\nexists a `caustic phase' beyond which no emission can be observed. This phase\ncorresponds to the zero (or minimum) curvature of the IOF trajectories and\nmaximum bunching of the emission. The maximum gradient of polarisation angle\n(PA) in the S-shaped PA curve is also associated with the curvature minimum and\noccurs at exactly the same phase. The asymmetry of trajectory curvature with\nrespect to the dipole axis affects the curvature emissivity and the efficiency\nof pair production, suggesting a minimum at the caustic phase. Emission over a\nfixed range of altitudes, as expected in millisecond pulsars, leads to broad\nleading profiles and sharp peaks with a cutoff phase on the TS.

The game is over as\nsoon as a monochromatic copy of some fixed graph $F$ has been created, and\nPainter's goal is to 'survive' for as many steps as possible before this\nhappens.\n  We present a new technique for deriving upper bounds on the threshold of this\ngame, i.e., on the typical number of steps Painter will survive with an optimal\nstrategy. More specifically, we consider a deterministic two-player variant of\nthe game where the edges are not chosen randomly, but by a second player\nBuilder.

As it follows from our\nexamination, the extent component contribution to source emission may be the\nindicator of the radio source age.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2009 15:14:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-20"}

Asymptotic studies where the sample size is fixed, and the dimension\ngrows [i.e., High Dimension, Low Sample Size (HDLSS)] are becoming increasingly\nrelevant. We investigate the asymptotic behavior of the Principal Component\n(PC) directions. HDLSS asymptotics are used to study consistency, strong\ninconsistency and subspace consistency. We show that if the first few\neigenvalues of a population covariance matrix are large enough compared to the\nothers, then the corresponding estimated PC directions are consistent or\nconverge to the appropriate subspace (subspace consistency) and most other PC\ndirections are strongly inconsistent. Broad sets of sufficient conditions for\neach of these cases are specified and the main theorem gives a catalogue of\npossible combinations. In preparation for these results, we show that the\ngeometric representation of HDLSS data holds under general conditions, which\nincludes a $\\rho$-mixing condition and a broad range of sphericity measures of\nthe covariance matrix.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2009 15:23:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-20"}

In fact, we show that the\ncelebrated quadratic reciprocity law is a direct consequence of our main\ntheorem applied to a specific group. As another consequence of our main theorem\nwe also recover a classical theorem of Sylvester. Our main focus is on explicit\nconstructions of representations over sufficiently small fields.
