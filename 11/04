After $\\sim\n10^{-2}$ $M_{\\odot}$ of helium has been accreted, the ram pressure of the hot\nhelium torus can deflect the accretion stream such that the stream no longer\ndirectly impacts the surface. The velocity difference between the stream and\nthe torus produces shearing which seeds large-scale Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstabilities along the interface between the two regions. These instabilities\neventually grow into dense knots of material that periodically strike the\nsurface of the primary, adiabatically compressing the underlying helium torus.\nIf the temperature of the compressed material is raised above a critical\ntemperature, the timescale for triple-$\\alpha$ reactions becomes comparable to\nthe dynamical timescale, leading to the detonation of the primary's helium\nenvelope. This detonation drives shockwaves into the primary which tend to\nconcentrate at one or more focal points within the primary's CO core. If a\nrelatively small amount of mass is raised above a critical temperature and\ndensity at these focal points, the CO core may itself be detonated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2009 18:16:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

To estimate the thermal\npressure we used public XMM-\\textit{Newton} archival data of 5 Abell clusters.\nTo describe the magnetic pressure, we assume a radial distribution for the\nmagnetic field, $B(r) \\propto \\rho_{g}^{\\alpha}$, to seek generality we assume\n$\\alpha$ within the range of 0.5 to 0.9, as indicated by observations and\nnumerical simulations.

Based on empirical evidence and several previous exact\ncalculations, we hypothesize that there exists an energy gap between the lowest\npossible energy of a glass (the ideal glass IG) and the crystal (CR). The gap\nis due to the presence of strongly correlated excitations with respect to the\nideal CR; thus, one can treat IG as a highly defective crystal. We argue that\nan excitation in IG requires energy that increases logarithmically with the\nsize of the system; as a consequence, we prove that IG must emerge at a\npositive temperature T_{K}. We propose an antiferromagnetic Ising model on a\nlattice to model liquid-crystal transition in a simple fluid or a binary\nmixture, which is then solved exactly on a recursive (Husimi) lattice to\ninvestigate the ideal glass transition, the nature of defects in the\nsupercooled liquid and CR analytically, and the effects of competing\ninteractions on the glass transition. The calculation establishes the gap. The\nlattice entropy of the supercooled liquid vanishes at a positive temperature\nT_{K}>0, where IG emerges but where CR has a positive entropy. The macrostate\nIG is in a particular and unique disordered microstate at T_{K}, just as the\nideal CR is in a perfectly ordered microstate at absolute zero. This explains\nwhy it is possible for CR to have a higher entropy at T_{K} than IG. The\ndemonstration here of an entropy crisis in monatomic systems along with\npreviously known results strongly suggests that the entropy crisis first noted\nby Kauzmann and demonstrated by Gibbs and DiMarzio in long polymers appears to\nbe ubiquitous in all supercooled liquids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2009 19:04:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-04"}

This instability is\nfound to be a nonlinear (or subcritical) instability, which cannot be described\nby ordinary linear approaches. It requires a radial entropy gradient weakly\nunstable for the Schwartzchild criterion and a strong thermal diffusivity (or\nequivalently a short cooling time).

The strongest practical\nlimitation for these experiments is how quickly accurate redshifts can be\nmeasured for sufficient galaxies to map the large-scale structure. A promising\nstrategy is to target emission-line (i.e. star-forming) galaxies at\nhigh-redshift (z~0.5-2); not only is the space density of this population\nincreasing out to z~2, but also emission-lines provide an efficient method of\nredshift determination.

A broad class of probabilistic theories exist which all share\nsome features with quantum theory, such as probabilistic predictions for\nindividual outcomes (indeterminism), the impossibility of information transfer\nfaster than speed of light (no-signaling) or the impossibility of copying of\nunknown states (no-cloning). A vast majority of attempts to find physical\nprinciples behind quantum theory either fall short of deriving the theory\nuniquely from the principles or are based on abstract mathematical assumptions\nthat require themselves a more conclusive physical motivation. Here, we show\nthat classical probability theory and quantum theory can be reconstructed from\nthree reasonable axioms: (1) (Information capacity) All systems with\ninformation carrying capacity of one bit are equivalent. (2) (Locality) The\nstate of a composite system is completely determined by measurements on its\nsubsystems. (3) (Reversibility) Between any two pure states there exists a\nreversible transformation. If one requires the transformation from the last\naxiom to be continuous, one separates quantum theory from the classical\nprobabilistic one. A remarkable result following from our reconstruction is\nthat no probability theory other than quantum theory can exhibit entanglement\nwithout contradicting one or more axioms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2009 22:00:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-17"}

The metal-rich (red) and metal-poor (blue)\nclusters have systematically different locations and kinematics in their host\ngalaxies. However, the red and blue clusters have similar internal properties,\nsuch as the masses, sizes, and ages. It is therefore interesting to explore\nwhether both metal-rich and metal-poor clusters could form by a common\nmechanism and still be consistent with the bimodal distribution. We show that\nif all globular clusters form only during mergers of massive gas-rich\nprotogalactic disks, their metallicity distribution could be statistically\nconsistent with that of the Galactic globulars. We take galaxy assembly history\nfrom cosmological dark matter simulations and couple it with the observed\nscaling relations for the amount of cold gas available for star formation. In\nthe best-fit model, early mergers of smaller hosts create exclusively blue\nclusters, whereas subsequent mergers of progenitor galaxies with a range of\nmasses create both red and blue clusters. Thus bimodality arises naturally as\nthe result of a small number of late massive merger events. We calculate the\ncluster mass loss, including the effects of two-body scattering and stellar\nevolution, and find that more blue clusters than red clusters are disrupted by\nthe present time, because of their smaller initial masses and larger ages. The\npresent-day mass function in the best-fit model is consistent with the Galactic\ndistribution. However, the spatial distribution of model clusters is much more\nextended than observed and is independent of the parameters of our model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2009 22:29:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Remarkably, this\ncorrelation among E and S0 galaxies follows that of nearby normal galaxies of\nall morphological types. In particular, the tight infrared color-color\ncorrelation for S0 galaxies alone follows that of the entire Hubble sequence of\nnormal galaxies, roughly in order of galaxy type from ellipticals to spirals to\nirregulars. The specific star formation rate of S0 galaxies estimated from the\n24um luminosity increases with decreasing Ks-band luminosity (or stellar mass)\nfrom essentially zero, as with most massive ellipticals, to rates typical of\nirregular galaxies. Moreover, the luminosities of the many infrared-luminous S0\ngalaxies can significantly exceed those of the most luminous (presumably\npost-merger) E galaxies. Star formation rates in the most infrared-luminous S0\ngalaxies approach 1-10 solar masses per year. Consistently with this picture we\nfind that while most early-type galaxies populate an infrared red sequence,\nabout 24% of the objects (mostly S0s) are in an infrared blue cloud together\nwith late type galaxies. For those early-type galaxies also observed at radio\nfrequencies we find that the far-infrared luminosities correlate with the mass\nof neutral and molecular hydrogen, but the scatter is large. This scatter\nsuggests that the star formation may be intermittent or that similar S0\ngalaxies with cold gaseous disks of nearly equal mass can have varying radial\ncolumn density distributions that alter the local and global SF rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2009 02:37:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

At T < 1000 K, methane is\nreactive but stable enough to reach the stratosphere, while water is stable\nenough that OH levels are suppressed by reaction with H2. These trends raise\nthe effective C/O ratio in the reacting gases above unity.

The modes of $l$ = 1 show up the\ncharacteristics of avoided crossings, which may be applied to test the internal\nstructure of this type stars.

We take a pricing kernel approach, which builds in the arbitrage-free\nproperty and provides a link to equilibrium economics. We require that the\npricing kernel be consistent with a pair of axioms, one giving the\ninter-temporal relations for dividend-paying assets, and the other ensuring the\nexistence of a money-market asset. We show that the existence of a\npositive-return asset implies the existence of a previsible money-market\naccount. A general expression for the price process of a limited-liability\nasset is derived. This expression includes two terms, one being the discounted\nrisk-adjusted value of the dividend stream, the other characterising retained\nearnings. The vanishing of the latter is given by a transversality condition.\nWe show (under the assumed axioms) that, in the case of a limited-liability\nasset with no permanently-retained earnings, the price process is given by the\nratio of a pair of potentials.

The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is an excellent site for AGB\nstudies. Over 40,000 AGB candidates have been identified using photometric data\nfrom the Spitzer Space Telescope Surveying The Agents of a Galaxy's Evolution\n(SAGE) mid-infrared (MIR) survey, including about 35,000 oxygen-rich, 7000\ncarbon-rich and 1400 \"extreme\" sources. For the first time, SAGE photometry\nreveals two distinct populations of O-rich sources in the LMC: a faint\npopulation that gradually evolves into C-rich stars and a bright, massive\npopulation that circumvents this evolution, remaining O-rich. This work aims to\nquantify the mass-loss return from AGB stars to the LMC, a rough estimate for\nwhich is derived from the amount of MIR dust emission in excess of that from\nstarlight.

The composites were prepared by\nintroduction of MWCNTs ($0.0001\\div0.1$ % wt) into LC solvent with subsequent\nsonication. The increase of MWCNT concentration (between $0.005\\div0.05$ % wt)\nresulted in self-organization of MWCNTs and formation of micron-sized\naggregates with fractal boundaries. The visually observed formation of spanning\nMWCNT networks near the percolation threshold at ~0.025 % wt was accompanied\nwith transition from non-conductive to conductive state and generation of\noptical singularities. The observed effects were explained by the strong\ninteractions between MWCNTs and LC medium and planar orientation of 5CB\nmolecules near the lateral surface of MWCNTs. It was speculated that optical\nsingularities arose as a results of interaction of an incident laser beam with\nLC perturbed interfacial shells covering the MWCNT clusters. Behavior of the\ninterfacial shell thickness in external electric field and in the vicinity of\nthe nematic to isotropic transition was discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2009 12:44:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-10"}

We investigate\nthese correlations, to extract useful information about the typical\nevolutionary stage of radio SNRs, and to obtain insight into the origin of the\nrelativistic electrons and magnetic fields responsible for the radio emission.\nWe propose a scenario, according to which the observed correlations are the\ncombined effect of SNRs evolving in a wide range of ambient conditions, rather\nthan the evolutionary track of a \"typical\" SNR. We then develop a parametric\napproach to interpret the statistical data, and apply it to the data sample\npreviously published by Berkhuijsen, as well as to a sample of SNRs in the\ngalaxy M33. We find that SNRs cease to emit effectively in radio at a stage\nnear the end of their Sedov evolution, and that models of synchrotron emission\nwith constant efficiencies in particle acceleration and magnetic field\namplification do not provide a close match to the data. We discuss the problem\nof the cumulative distribution in size, showing that the slope of this\ndistribution does not relate to the expansion law of SNRs, as usually assumed,\nbut only to the ambient density distribution. This solves a long-standing\nparadox: the almost linear cumulative distribution of SNRs led several authors\nto conclude that these SNRs are still in free expansion, which also implies\nvery low ambient densities. Within this framework, we discuss the case of the\nstarburst galaxy M82.

We propose here the idea of geometry of effective physical process as\nthe essentially physical notion of computation. In Quantum mechanics we cannot\nuse the traditional Euclidean geometry but we introduce more sophisticate non\nEuclidean geometry which include a new kind of information diffuse in the\nentire universe and that we can represent as Fisher information or active\ninformation. We remark that from the Fisher information we can obtain the Bohm\nand Hiley quantum potential and the classical Schrodinger equation. We can see\nthe quantum phenomena do not affect a limited region of the space but is\nreflected in a change of the geometry of all the universe. In conclusion any\nlocal physical change or physical process is reflected in all the universe by\nthe change of its geometry, This is the deepest meaning of the entanglement in\nQuantum mechanics and quantum computing. We stress the connection between\nmetric and information as measure of change. Because computation is not\nrestricted to calculus but is the environment changing via physical processes,\nsuper-Turing potentialities derive from an incomputable information source\nembedded into the geometry of the universe in accordance with Bell's\nconstraints. In the general relativity we define the geometry of the space\ntime. In our approach quantum phenomena define the geometry of the parameters\nof the probability distribution that include also the space time parameters.

However, we find that the bipolaron model can also explain both\nthe enhanced value and the weak temperature dependence of the Hall-Lorenz\nnumber.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2009 15:26:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-04"}

At VLA resolution (~0.1 arcsec), the nucleus of the Seyfert\ngalaxies is unresolved, with the exception of MCG-5-23-16 and NGC 7469 showing\na core-jet structure. Three Seyfert nuclei are surrounded by diffuse radio\nemission related to star-forming regions. VLBA observations with parsec-scale\nresolution pointed out that in MRK 1239 the nucleus is clearly resolved into\ntwo components separated by ~30 pc, while the nucleus of NGC 3783 is\nunresolved. Further comparison between VLA and VLBA data of these two sources\nshows that the flux density at parsec scales is only 20% of that measured by\nthe VLA. This suggests that the radio emission is not concentrated in a single\ncentral component, as in elliptical radio galaxies, and an additional\nlow-surface brightness component must be present. A comparison of Seyfert\nnuclei with different radio spectra points out that the ``presence'' of\nundetected flux on milli-arcsecond scale is common in steep-spectrum objects,\nwhile in flat-spectrum objects essentially all the radio emission is recovered.\nIn the steep-spectrum objects, the nature of this ``missing'' flux is likely\ndue to non-thermal AGN-related radiation, perhaps from a jet that gets\ndisrupted in Seyfert galaxies because of the denser environment of their spiral\nhosts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2009 15:28:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}
