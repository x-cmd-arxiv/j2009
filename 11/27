This has been motivated partly by frameworks like multitask\nlearning, multisensor networks or structured output data. From a Gaussian\nprocesses perspective, the problem reduces to specifying an appropriate\ncovariance function that, whilst being positive semi-definite, captures the\ndependencies between all the data points and across all the outputs. One\napproach to account for non-trivial correlations between outputs employs\nconvolution processes. Under a latent function interpretation of the\nconvolution transform we establish dependencies between output variables. The\nmain drawbacks of this approach are the associated computational and storage\ndemands. In this paper we address these issues. We present different sparse\napproximations for dependent output Gaussian processes constructed through the\nconvolution formalism.

These findings suggest that\nwithin our time window (10 ns), the structural changes observed at the heme\nlevel are the first steps of the protein denaturation process, pre-viously\ndescribed experimentally in micellar solutions. In addition, a specific binding\nof AOT molecules to a few lysine residues of the protein was found only in the\nsmall-sized RM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 2009 16:29:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-01"}

We explore in particular the metallicity dependence of\nmolecular cloud fragmentation and the possible variations in the dense core\nmass function, as the expression of a multi-phase ISM, due to dynamic and\nthermodynamic effects in starburst and metal-poor environments. To study the\nlevel of fragmentation during the collapse, the adaptive mesh refinement code\nFLASH is used. With this code, including self-gravity, thermal balance,\nturbulence and shocks, collapse is simulated with four different metallicity\ndependent cooling functions. Turbulent and rotational energies are considered\nas well. During the simulations, number densities of 10^8-10^9 cm^-3 are\nreached. The influences of dust and cosmic ray heating are investigated and a\ncomparison to isothermal cases is made. The presented results indicate that\nfragmentation increases with metallicity, while cosmic ray and gas-grain\ncollisional heating counteract this. We also find that modest rotation and\nturbulence can impact the cloud evolution as far as fragmentation is concerned.\nIn this light, we conclude that radiative feedback, in starburst regions, will\ninhibit fragmentation, while low-metallicity dwarfs also should enjoy a star\nformation mode in which fragmentation is suppressed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 2009 16:47:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

The crux of the process is a clustering procedure called\nprize-collecting clustering that breaks down the input instance into separate\nsubinstances which are easier to handle; moreover, the terminals in different\nsubinstances are far from each other. Each subinstance has a relatively\ninexpensive Steiner tree connecting all its terminals, and the subinstances can\nbe solved (almost) separately.

One of the\nmain difficulties for this unification is that between inflation and dark\nmatter one needs a successful reheating process and a long lasting period of\nradiation. Therefore the amount of energy density in the inflaton-dark matter\nfield phi must be fine tune after reheating to give dark matter. Here we show\nan alternative scheme in which the inflaton decays completely, disappearing\nentirely from the spectrum. However, at low energies, before matter-radiation\nequality, the same interaction term that leads to the inflaton decay,\nregenerates phi. An essential feature is that the transition between the\nintermediate radiation dominated to the dark matter phase is related to a\nquantum generation of the scalar field \\phi instead to purely classical\ndynamics. Thanks to this quantum transition the inflation-dark matter\nunification can take place naturally without fine tuning. The unification\nscheme presented here has three parameters, the mass of the dark matter\nparticle m_o, the inflation parameter lambda and the coupling g for the\ninflaton interaction. Phenomenology fixes the value for lambda and gives a\nconstraint between g and m_o, leaving only the mass of the dark matter particle\nm_o as a free parameter. These same three parameters lambda, m_o, g are present\nin models with inflation and a dark matter wimp particle but without\nunification. Therefore our unification scheme does not increase the number of\nparameters and it accomplishes the desired unification between inflaton and\ndark matter for free.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 2009 22:50:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-30"}

By examining in\ndetail the transition region where the dynamics of the suppressed bubble\nchanges drastically as the inter-bubble distance changes, we determined that\nthe explosive expansion of a bubble under negative pressure can be interrupted\nand turn into collapse even though the far-field liquid pressure well exceeds\nthe bubble's threshold pressure. Numerical results suggest that the\ninterruption of expansion occurs when the bubble radius is exceeded by the\ninstantaneous unstable equilibrium radius of the bubble determined using the\ntotal pressure acting on the bubble. When we extended the discussion to systems\nof larger numbers of bubbles, we found that a larger number of bubbles have a\nstronger suppression effect. The present findings would be useful in\nunderstanding the complex behavior of cavitation bubbles in practical\napplications where in general many cavitation nuclei exist and may interact\nwith each other.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2009 01:32:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-30"}

One of the key\nproposals to offset radiative energy losses is thermal conduction from outer,\nhotter layers of cool core clusters to their centers. However, conduction is\nsensitive to magnetic field topology. In cool-core clusters the heat buoyancy\ninstability (HBI) leads to B-fields ordered preferentially in the direction\nperpendicular to that of gravity, which significantly reduces the level of\nconduction below the classical Spitzer-Braginskii value. However, the cluster\ncool cores are rarely in perfect hydrostatic equilibrium. Sloshing motions due\nto minor mergers, galaxy motions or AGN can significantly perturb the gas and\naffect the level of thermal conduction. We perform 3D AMR MHD simulations of\nthe effect of turbulence on the properties of the anisotropic thermal\nconduction in cool core clusters. We show that very weak subsonic motions, well\nwithin observational constraints, can randomize the magnetic field and\nsignificantly boost effective thermal conduction beyond the saturated values\nexpected in the pure unperturbed HBI case. We find that the turbulent motions\ncan essentially restore the conductive heat flow to the cool core to level\ncomparable to the theoretical maximum of 1/3 Spitzer for a highly tangled\nfield. Runs with radiative cooling show that the cooling catastrophe can be\naverted and the cluster core stabilized. Above a critical Froude number, these\nsame turbulent motions also eliminate the tangential bias in the velocity and\nmagnetic field that is otherwise induced by the trapped g-modes.

Lambda Prolog achieves\nits functionality by extending a Prolog-like language by using typed lambda\nterms as data structures that it then manipulates via higher-order unification\nand some new program-level abstraction mechanisms. These additional features\nraise new implementation questions that must be adequately addressed for Lambda\nProlog to be an effective programming tool. We consider these questions here,\nproviding eventually a virtual machine and compilation based realization. A key\nidea is the orientation of the computation model of Lambda Prolog around a\nrestricted version of higher-order unification with nice algorithmic properties\nand appearing to encompass most interesting applications. Our virtual machine\nembeds a treatment of this form of unification within the structure of the\nWarren Abstract Machine that is used in traditional Prolog implementations.\nAlong the way, we treat various auxiliary issues such as the low-level\nrepresentation of lambda terms, the implementation of reduction on such terms\nand the optimized processing of types in computation. We also develop an actual\nimplementation of Lambda Prolog called Teyjus Version 2. A characteristic of\nthis system is that it realizes an emulator for the virtual machine in the C\nlanguage a compiler in the OCaml language. We present a treatment of the\nsoftware issues that arise from this kind of mixing of languages within one\nsystem and we discuss issues relevant to the portability of our virtual machine\nemulator across arbitrary architectures. Finally, we assess the the efficacy of\nour various design ideas through experiments carried out using the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2009 06:18:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-30"}

All of these studies\nfocus on broad line quasars with BH mass estimated from virial estimators based\non single-epoch spectra. Since the sample selection is largely based on quasar\nluminosity, the cosmic scatter in the BH-bulge relation introduces a\nstatistical bias leading to on average more massive BHs given galaxy properties\nat high redshift (Lauer et al. 2007). We here emphasize a previously\nunder-appreciated statistical bias resulting from the uncertainty of\nsingle-epoch virial BH mass estimators and the shape of the underlying (true)\nBH mass function, which leads to on average overestimation of the true BH\nmasses at the high-mass end (Shen et al. 2008). We demonstrate that the latter\nvirial mass bias can contribute a substantial amount to the observed excess in\nBH mass at fixed bulge properties, comparable to the Lauer et al. bias. The\nvirial mass bias is independent of the Lauer et al. bias, hence if both biases\nare at work, they can largely (or even fully) account for the observed BH mass\nexcess at high redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2009 07:10:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Apr 2010 00:53:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

At the frequency of the line, 119 GHz, the Odin telescope has a beam\nwidth of 10', larger than the size of the dense core, so that the precise\nnature of the emitting source and its exact location and extent are unknown.\nThe current investigation is intended to remedy this. Telluric absorption makes\nground based O_2 observations essentially impossible and observations had to be\ndone from space. mm-wave telescopes on space platforms were necessarily small,\nwhich resulted in large, several arcminutes wide, beam patterns. Although the\nEarth's atmosphere is entirely opaque to low-lying O_2 transitions, it allows\nground based observations of the much rarer O18O in favourable conditions and\nat much higher angular resolution with larger telescopes. In addition, rho Oph\nA exhibits both multiple radial velocity systems and considerable velocity\ngradients. Extensive mapping of the region in the proxy C18O (J=3-2) line can\nbe expected to help identify the O_2 source on the basis of its line shape and\nDoppler velocity. Line opacities were determined from observations of optically\nthin 13C18O (J=3-2) at selected positions. During several observing periods,\ntwo C18O intensity maxima in rho Oph A were searched for in the 16O18O\n(2_1-0_1) line at 234 GHz with the 12m APEX telescope. Our observations\nresulted in an upper limit on the integrated O18O intensity of < 0.01 K km/s (3\nsigma) into the 26.5\" beam. We conclude that the source of observed O_2\nemission is most likely confined to the central regions of the rho Oph A cloud.\nIn this limited area, implied O_2 abundances could thus be higher than\npreviously reported, by up to two orders of magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2009 11:51:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

They are conventionally classified into long and short ones depending\non their time duration, $T_{90}$. Because of the advantage their high redshifts\noffer, many efforts have been made to apply GRBs to cosmology. The key to this\nis to find correlations between some measurable properties of GRBs and the\nenergy or the luminosity of GRBs. These correlations are usually referred to as\nluminosity relations and are helpful in understanding the GRBs themselves. In\nthis paper, we explored such correlations in the X-ray emission of GRBs. The\nX-ray emission of GRBs observed by \\emph{Swift} has the exponential functional\nform in the prompt phase and relaxes to a power-law decay at time $T_p$. We\nhave assumed a linear relation between $\\log L_{X, p}$ (with $L_{X, p}$ being\nthe X-ray luminosity at $T_p$) and $\\log [T_p/(1+z)]$, but there is some\nevidence for curvature in the data and the true relationship between $L_{X, p}$\nand $T_p/(1+z)$ may be a broken power law. The limited GRB sample used in our\nanalysis is still not sufficient for us to conclude whether the break is real\nor just an illusion caused by outliers. We considered both cases in our\nanalysis and discussed the implications of the luminosity relation, especially\non the time duration of GRBs and their classification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2009 11:55:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Apr 2010 11:41:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 6 Jun 2010 13:53:44 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 27 Jun 2010 09:21:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

The\nspectrum of the X-ray emission is well fitted by an optically thin coronal\nmodel with an average temperature of 0.5 keV. The addition of a fluorescent\noxygen emission line at ~0.53 keV improves the fits significantly. In\naccordance with earlier reports, we interpret the coronal component as emission\nfrom the planetary disk, produced by the scattering of solar X-rays in Saturn's\nupper atmosphere, and the line as originating from the Saturnian rings. The\nstrength of the disk X-ray emission is seen to decrease over the period 2002 -\n2005, following the decay of solar activity towards the current minimum in the\nsolar cycle.
