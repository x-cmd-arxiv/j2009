By\nminimally extending the standard definition of coherent states so as to include\nthe string theory requirements, we show that the naive construction of the the\nclosed string coherent states requires the existence of a lightlike\ncompactification of spacetime. When the null winding states in the underlying\nHilbert space are projected out the resulting vertex operators satisfy the\ndefinition of a coherent state and have a classical interpretation. We present\nexplicitly both the covariant and lightcone gauge realization of the resulting\nstates using the DDF map that relates the two. We also identify the\ncorresponding general lightcone gauge classical solutions around which the\nquantum states are fluctuating. We go on to show that both the covariant gauge\ncoherent vertex operators, the corresponding lightcone gauge coherent states\nand the classical solutions all share the same mass and angular momenta and\nconjecture that the covariant and lightcone gauge states are different\nmanifestations of the same state and share identical interactions. This\nconstruction can be used to study the evolution of fundamental cosmic strings\nas predicted by string theory and may also be useful for other applications\nwhere massive string vertex operators are of interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Nov 2009 20:10:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2010 20:13:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2011 16:34:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-05"}

Several previous studies have considered the\nemission resulting from the accretion of bound material; we consider the\npossibility that the unbound debris may also radiate once it has expanded and\nbecome transparent. We show that the gradual energy input from hydrogen\nrecombination compensates for adiabatic loses over significant expansion\nfactors. The opacity also drops dramatically with recombination, and the\ninternal energy can be radiated by means of a cooling-transparency wave\npropagating from the surface layers inward. The result is a brief optical\ntransient occurring ~1 week after disruption and lasting 3-5 days with peak\nluminosities of 10^40-10^42 ergs/s, depending on the mass of the disrupted\nstar. These recombination powered transients should accompany the\nx-ray/ultraviolet flare from the accretion of bound material, and so may be a\nuseful signature for discriminating tidal disruption events, especially for\nlower and intermediate mass black holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Nov 2009 17:05:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

Although the proton intensity was very low, with only one pilot\nbunch per beam, and no systematic attempt was made to optimize the collision\noptics, all LHC experiments reported a number of collision candidates. In the\nALICE experiment, the collision region was centred very well in both the\nlongitudinal and transverse directions and 284 events were recorded in\ncoincidence with the two passing proton bunches. The events were immediately\nreconstructed and analyzed both online and offline. We have used these events\nto measure the pseudorapidity density of charged primary particles in the\ncentral region.

We have\nclassified the members of Taurus according to whether they show evidence of\ndisks and envelopes (classes I, II, and III). The disk fraction in Taurus is\n75% for solar-mass stars and declines to 45% for low-mass stars and brown\ndwarfs (0.01-0.3 M_sun). This dependence on stellar mass is similar to that\nmeasured for Cha I, although the disk fraction in Taurus is slightly higher\noverall, probably because of its younger age (1 vs. 2-3 Myr). In comparison,\nthe disk fraction for solar-mass stars is much lower (20%) in IC 348 and Sigma\nOri, which are denser than Taurus and Cha I and are roughly coeval with the\nlatter. These data indicate that disk lifetimes for solar-mass stars are longer\nin regions that have lower stellar densities. Through an analysis of multiple\nepochs of photometry that are available for ~200 Taurus members, we find that\nstars with disks exhibit significantly greater mid-IR variability than diskless\nstars. Finally, we have used our data in Taurus to refine the criteria for\nprimordial, evolved, and transitional disks. The number ratio of evolved and\ntransitional disks to primordial disks in Taurus is 15/98 for K5-M5, indicating\na timescale of 0.15 x tau(primordial)=0.45 Myr for the clearing of the inner\nregions of optically thick disks.

The magnetic maps show a field\nthat is predominantly dipolar and non-axisymmetric with a strong azimuthal\ncomponent. The field is 50% poloidal and 50% toroidal, and there is very little\ndifferential rotation apparent from the magnetic images.\n  A photometric monitoring campaign on this star has previously revealed V-band\nvariability of up to 0.6 magnitudes but in 2009 the lightcurve is much flatter.\nThe Doppler image presented here is consistent with this low variability.\nCalculating the flux predicted by the mapped spot distribution gives an\npeak-to-peak variability of 0.04 magnitudes. The reduction in the amplitude of\nthe lightcurve, compared with previous observations, appears to be related to a\nchange in the distribution of the spots, rather than the number or area.\n  This paper is the first from a Zeeman-Doppler imaging campaign being carried\nout on V410 Tau between 2009-2012 at TBL. During this time it is expected that\nthe lightcurve will return to a high amplitude state, allowing us to ascertain\nwhether the photometric changes are accompanied by a change in the magnetic\nfield topology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Nov 2009 10:58:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

First, a\nkinematical model is constructed for SN Ia 2003hv, which can account for the\nmain features in its optical, Near-Infrared (NIR), and Mid-Infrared (Mid-IR)\nlate-time spectra. It is found that an asymmetric off-center model can explain\nthe observed characteristics of SN 2003hv. This model includes a relatively\nhigh density, Fe-rich region which displays a large velocity off-set, and a\nrelatively low density, extended 56Ni-rich region which is more spherically\ndistributed. The high density region consists of the inner stable Fe-Ni region\nand outer 56Ni-rich region. Such a distribution may be the result of a\ndelayed-detonation explosion, in which the first deflagration produces the\nglobal asymmetry in the innermost ejecta, while the subsequent detonation can\nlead to the bulk spherical symmetry. This configuration, if viewed from the\ndirection of the off-set, can consistently explain the blueshift in some of the\nemission lines and virtually no observed shift in other lines in SN 2003hv. For\nthis model, we then explore the effects of different viewing angles and the\nimplications for SNe Ia in general. The model predicts that a variation of the\ncentral wavelength, depending on the viewing angle, should be seen in some\nlines (e.g., [Ni II]7378), while the strongest lines (e.g., [Fe III] blend at\n4700A) will not show this effect. By examining optical nebular spectra of 12\nSNe Ia, we have found that such a variation indeed exists. We suggest that the\nglobal asymmetry in the innermost ejecta, as likely imprint of the deflagration\nflame propagation, is a generic feature of SNe Ia (abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Nov 2009 14:37:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Dec 2009 01:51:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}
