However, it remains unclear whether this\nself-regulation occurs on the scale at which the BH is gravitationally\ndominant, on that of the stellar bulge, the galaxy, or that of the entire dark\nmatter halo. To answer this question, we use self-consistent simulations of the\nco-evolution of the BH and galaxy populations that reproduce the observed\ncorrelations between the masses of the BHs and the properties of their host\ngalaxies. We first confirm unambiguously that the BHs regulate their growth:\nthe amount of energy that the BHs inject into their surroundings remains\nunchanged when the fraction of the accreted rest mass energy that is injected,\nis varied by four orders of magnitude. The BHs simply adjust their masses so as\nto inject the same amount of energy. We then use simulations with artificially\nreduced star formation rates to demonstrate explicitly that BH mass is not set\nby the stellar mass. Instead, we find that it is determined by the mass of the\ndark matter halo with a secondary dependence on the halo concentration, of the\nform that would be expected if the halo binding energy were the fundamental\nproperty that controls the mass of the BH. We predict that the logarithmic\nslope of the relation between dark matter halo mass and black hole mass is\n1.55+/-0.05 and that the scatter around the mean relation in part reflects the\nscatter in the halo concentration-mass relation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2009 16:25:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2010 10:18:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

An ~100 ksec\npointing with XMM/Newton obtained in January, 2008 reveals a strong 10 mHz QPO\nin the > 1 keV flux, as well as flat-topped, band limited noise breaking to a\npower law. The energy spectrum is again dominated by two components, a 0.16 keV\nthermal disk and a power-law with an index of ~2.5. These new measurements,\ncombined with results from our previous January 2006 pointing in which we first\ndetected QPOs, show for the first time in a ULX a pattern of spectral and\ntemporal correlations strongly analogous to that seen in Galactic black hole\nsources, but at much higher X-ray luminosity and longer characteristic\ntime-scales. We find that the QPO frequency is proportional to the inferred\ndisk flux, while the QPO and broad-band noise amplitude (root mean squared,\nrms) are inversely proportional to the disk flux. Assuming that QPO frequency\nscales inversely with black hole mass at a given power-law spectral index we\nderive mass estimates using the observed QPO frequency - spectral index\nrelations from five stellar-mass black hole systems with dynamical mass\nconstraints. The results from all sources are consistent with a mass range for\nNGC 5408 X-1 from 1000 - 9000 solar masses. Moreover, the recent relation from\nGierlinski et al. that relates black hole mass to the strength of variability\nat high frequencies (above the break in the power spectrum) is also indicative\nof such a high mass for NGC 5408 X-1. We argue that these new findings strongly\nsupport the conclusion that NGC 5408 X-1 harbors an intermediate mass black\nhole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2009 16:48:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

We find that NGC 6034 is\nembedded in a large structure, dominated by three rich clusters and other small\ngroups. Its first and next four ranked galaxies have magnitude differences in\nthe r band and projected distances which violate the optical criteria to\nclassify it as a fossil group. We confirm that the UGC 842 group is a fossil\ngroup, but with about half the velocity dispersion that is reported in previous\nworks. The velocity distribution of its galaxies reveals the existence of two\nstructures in its line of sight, one with sigmaV ~ 223 km/s and another with\nsigmaV ~ 235 km/s, with a difference in velocity of ~820 km/s. The main\nstructure is dominated by passive galaxies, while these represent ~60% of the\nsecond structure. The X-ray temperature for the intragroup medium of a group\nwith such a velocity dispersion is expected to be kT ~0.5-1 keV, against the\nobserved value of kT ~1.9 keV reported in the literature. This result makes UGC\n842 a special case among fossil groups because (1) it represents more likely\nthe interaction between two small groups, which warms the intragroup medium\nand/or (2) it could constitute evidence that member galaxies lost energy in the\nprocess of spiraling toward the group center, and decreased the velocity\ndispersion of the system. As far as we know, UGC 842 is the first low-mass\nfossil group studied in detail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2009 19:10:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2009 16:23:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

However, this interpretation\nof the observed re-brightening of the X-ray afterglow (AG) of GRB081028 is\nunlikely in view of its large equivalent isotropic gamma-ray energy. Moreover,\nwe show that the late-time re-brightening of the AG of GRB081028 is well\nexplained by the cannonball (CB) model of GRBs as a synchrotron flare emitted\nwhen the jet that produced the GRB in a star formation region (SFR) in the host\ngalaxy crossed the SFR boundary into the interstellar medium or the halo of the\nhost galaxy.

Concrete scenarios are described in these low-dimensional cases,\npinpointing where to look for potential, but critical, high-order obstructions\nin the corresponding Taylor towers.

Although Granger\ncausality is not \"effective causality\", this concept is useful to infer\ndirectionality and information flow in observational data. Granger causality is\nusually identified by using VAR models due to their simplicity. In the last few\nyears, several VAR-based models were presented in order to model gene\nregulatory networks. Here, we generalize the multivariate Granger causality\nconcept in order to identify Granger causalities between sets of gene\nexpressions, i.e., whether a set of n genes Granger-causes another set of m\ngenes, aiming at identifying and quantifying the flow of information between\ngene networks (or pathways). The concept of Granger causality for sets of\nvariables is presented. Moreover, a method for its identification with a\nbootstrap test is proposed. This method is applied in simulated and also in\nactual biological gene expression data in order to model regulatory networks.\nThis concept may be useful to understand the complete information flow from one\nnetwork or pathway to the other, mainly in regulatory networks. Linking this\nconcept to graph theory, sink and source can be generalized to node sets.\nMoreover, hub and centrality for sets of genes can be defined based on total\ninformation flow. Another application is in annotation, when the functionality\nof a set of genes is unknown, but this set is Granger caused by another set of\ngenes which is well studied. Therefore, this information may be useful to infer\nor construct some hypothesis about the unknown set of genes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2009 01:16:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-09"}

These\noscillations depend on the initial energy spectra, and relative fluxes or\nrelative luminosities of the neutrinos. It has been observed that departure\nfrom energy equipartition among different flavors can give rise to one or more\nsharp spectral swap over energy, termed as splits. We study the occurrence of\nsplits in the neutrino and antineutrino spectra, varying the initial relative\nfluxes for different models of initial energy spectrum, in both normal and\ninverted hierarchy. These initial relative flux variations give rise to several\npossible split patterns whereas variation over different models of energy\nspectra give similar results. We explore the effect of these spectral splits on\nthe electron fraction, $Y_e$, that governs r-process nucleosynthesis inside\nsupernovae. Since spectral splits modify the electron neutrino and antineutrino\nspectra in the region where r-process is postulated to happen, and since the\npattern of spectral splits depends on the initial conditions of the spectra and\nthe neutrino mass hierarchy, we show that the condition $Y_e < 0.5$ required\nfor successful r-process nucleosynthesis will lead to constraints on the\ninitial spectral conditions, for a given neutrino mass hierarchy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2009 11:13:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Jun 2010 10:36:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

Recently, we have introduced a sample of rare, nearby\n(z<0.3) starbursts that appear to be good analogs of LBGs. These \"Lyman Break\nAnalogs\" (LBAs) provide an excellent training set for understanding starbursts\nat different redshifts. We present an application of this by comparing the\nrest-frame UV/optical morphologies of 30 LBAs with those of sBzK galaxies at\nz~2, and LBGs at z~3-4 in the HUDF. The UV/optical colors and sizes of LBAs and\nLBGs are very similar, while the BzK galaxies are somewhat redder and larger.\nThere is significant overlap between the morphologies (G, C, A and M_20) of the\nlocal and high-z samples, although the latter are somewhat less concentrated\nand clumpier. We find that in the majority of LBAs the starbursts appear to be\ntriggered by interactions/mergers. When the images of the LBAs are degraded to\nthe same sensitivity and resolution as the images of LBGs and BzK galaxies,\nthese relatively faint asymmetric features are no longer detectable. This\neffect is particularly severe in the rest-frame UV. It has been suggested that\nhigh-z galaxies experience intense bursts unlike anything seen locally,\npossibly due to cold flows and instabilities. In part, this is based on the\nfact that the majority (~70%) of LBGs do not show morphological signatures of\nmergers. Our results suggest that this evidence is insufficient, since a large\nfraction of such signatures would likely have been missed in current\nobservations of z>2 galaxies. This leaves open the possibility that clumpy\naccretion and mergers remain important in driving the evolution of these\nstarbursts, together with rapid gas accretion through other means.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2009 15:44:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Dec 2009 16:00:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}
