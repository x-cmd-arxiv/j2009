We\nhave obtained photometry from images of a sample of Galactic Cepheids with the\nIRAC and MIPS instruments on Spitzer. Here we present the first mid-infrared\nperiod-luminosity relations for Classical Cepheids in the Galaxy, and the first\never Cepheid period-luminosity relations at 24 and 70 um. We compare these\nrelations with theoretical predictions, and with period-luminosity relations\nobtained in recent studies of the Large Magellanic Cloud. We find a significant\nperiod-color relation for the [3.6]-[8.0] IRAC color. Other mid-infrared colors\nfor both Cepheids and non-variable supergiants are strongly affected by\nvariable molecular spectral features, in particular deep CO absorption bands.\nWe do not find strong evidence for mid-infrared excess caused by warm (~500 K)\ncircumstellar dust.

Energy input from BHs\nsignificantly reduces fgas for groups with masses less than ~10^14 Msun,\nyielding fgas-T and L-T relations that are in agreement with the data.

The classical Cartan\nprolongations deal with rank-2 distributions and are responsible for the\nappearance of the Goursat distributions. Similarly, the so-called special\nmulti-flags are generated in the result of successive applications of gCp's.\nSingularities of such distributions turn out to be very rich, although without\nfunctional moduli of the local classification. The paper focuses on special\n2-flags, obtained by sequences of gCp's applied to rank-3 distributions. A\nstratification of germs of special 2-flags of all lengths into singularity\nclasses is constructed. This stratification provides invariant geometric\nsignificance to the vast family of local polynomial pseudo-normal forms for\nspecial 2-flags introduced earlier in [Mormul P., Banach Center Publ., Vol. 65,\nPolish Acad.

Our\nCO+ detection suffers from significant blending to a group of transitions of\n13CH3OH, tentatively detected for the first time in the extragalactic\ninterstellar medium. These species are efficiently formed in the highly UV\nirradiated outer layers of molecular clouds, as observed in the late stage\nnuclear starburst in M 82. The molecular abundance ratios we derive for these\nmolecules are very similar to those found in M 82. This strongly supports the\nidea that these molecules are tracing the PDR component associated with the\nstarburst in the nuclear region of NGC 253. A comparison with the predictions\nof chemical models for PDRs shows that the observed molecular ratios are\ntracing the outer layers of UV illuminated clouds up to two magnitudes of\nvisual extinction. Chemical models, which include grain formation and\nphotodissociation of HNCO, support the scenario of a photo-dominated chemistry\nas an explanation to the abundances of the observed species.

In this work,\nwe present our first-principles studies of the energy bands associated with\nvarious monovalent (Na, K, and Ag) and trivalent (Sb and Bi) impurities and\nimpurity clusters in PbTe, SnTe, and GeTe using supercell models. We find that\nmonovalent and trivalent impurity atoms tend to come close to one another and\nform impurity-rich clusters, and the electronic structure of the host materials\nis strongly perturbed by the impurities. There are impurity-induced bands\nassociated with the trivalent impurities that split off from the\nconduction-band bottom with large shifts towards the valence-band top. This is\ndue to the interaction between the $p$ states of the trivalent impurity cation\nand the divalent anion which tends to drive the systems towards metallicity.\nThe introduction of monovalent impurities (in the presence of trivalent\nimpurities) significantly reduces (in PbTe and GeTe) or slightly enhances (in\nSnTe) the effect of the trivalent impurities. One, therefore, can tailor the\nband gap and band structure near the band gap (hence transport properties) by\nchoosing the type of impurity and its concentration or tuning the\nmonovalent/trivalent ratio.

The calculations have been carried out for\naxial-symmetric pillars of three different shapes: conical, hemispherical\ntopped and flat topped cylindrical pillars. Calculations show that, assuming\nthe same pillar spacing, conical pillars may be more incline to undergo an\nimpalement transition to the Wenzel state, but, on the other hand, they are\ncharacterized by a vanishing pull-off pressure which causes the drop not to\nadhere to the substrate and therefore to detach very easily.

It is possible to combine large\nresistance to impalement transition (i.e. large value of p_{W}) and small (or\neven vanishing) detaching pressure p_{out} by employing cylindrical pillars\nwith conical tips.

At small $L$, perturbation\ntheory may be used reliably to compute the effective potential for the Polyakov\nloop $P$ in the compact direction. Periodic adjoint fermions act in opposition\nto the gauge fields, which by themselves would lead to a deconfined phase at\nsmall $L$. In order for the fermionic effects to dominate gauge field effects\nin the effective potential, the fermion mass must be sufficiently small. This\nindicates that chiral symmetry breaking effects are potentially important. We\ndevelop a Polyakov-Nambu-Jona Lasinio (PNJL) model which combines the known\nperturbative behavior of adjoint QCD models at small $L$ with chiral symmetry\nbreaking effects to produce an effective potential for the Polyakov loop $P$\nand the chiral order parameter $\\bar{\\psi}\\psi$.

Such\nsources are most plausibly triggered by an AGN, but their observational\nproperties are not entirely consistent with those of standard radio galaxy\npopulations. In the present work we aim at a better understanding of the radio\nspectra of such sources and ultimately of the nature of AGNs at sub-mJy flux\nlevels. We used the ATCA to get multi-frequency (4.8, 8.6 and 19 GHz)\nquasi-simultaneous observations for a representative sub-sample of ATESP radio\nsources associated with early-type galaxies (26 objects with S>0.6 mJy).

From the analysis of the radio spectra, we find that our sources are\nmost probably jet-dominated systems.

The H-alpha variability, quantified in terms of\nthe ratio of maximum to minimum H-alpha equivalent width (R_EW), and the ratio\nof the standard deviation to the mean (sigma_EW/<EW>), exhibits a rapid rise\nfrom M0 to M5, followed by a plateau and a possible decline in M9 objects.

As a first step towards a better understanding of this situation we\nconsider in this paper the model of a dielectric as a collection of\noscillators, each of which is coupled to a reservoir giving rise to damping and\nLangevin forces on the oscillators and a noise polarization acting as a source\nof a fluctuating electromagnetic (EM) field in the dielectric. The model leads\nnaturally to expressions for the quantized EM fields that are consistent with\nthose obtained by different approaches, and also results in a\nfluctuation-dissipation relation between the noise polarization and the\nimaginary part of the permittivity; comparison with the Rytov\nfluctuation-dissipation relation employed in the well-known Lifshitz theory for\nthe van der Waals (or Casimir) force shows that the Lifshitz theory is actually\na classical stochastic electrodynamical theory. The approximate classical\nexpression for the energy density in a band of frequencies at which absorption\nin a dielectric is negligible is shown to be exact as a spectral thermal\nequilibrium expectation value in the quantum-electrodynamical theory. Our main\nresult is the derivation of an expression for the QED energy density of a\nuniform dispersive, absorbing media in thermal equilibrium. The spectral\ndensity of the energy is found to have the same form with or without\nabsorption. We also show how the fluctuation-dissipation theorem ensures a\ndetailed balance of energy exchange between the (absorbing) medium, the\nreservoir and the EM field in thermal equilibrium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Nov 2009 00:41:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-06"}

We estimate the mean age of\nthe cluster to be 3 Myr by combining our F160W photometry with previously\nobtained HST WFPC2 optical F555W and F814W band photometry and comparing the\nstellar locus in the color-magnitude diagram with main sequence and pre-main\nsequence isochrones. The color-magnitude diagrams show the presence of\ndifferential extinction and possibly an age spread of a few megayears. We\nconvert the magnitudes into masses adopting both a single mean age of 3 Myr\nisochrone and a constant star formation history from 2 to 4 Myr. We derive the\nIMF after correcting for incompleteness due to crowding. The faintest stars\ndetected have a mass of 0.5 Msun and the data are more than 50% complete\noutside a radius of 5 pc down to a mass limit of 1.1 Msun for 3 Myr old\nobjects.

For\nobserving interval of $z$ the total rotation angle acquires the value $\\sim\n90^{\\circ}$. We suggest the possible explanation of the half of this rotation\nas a consequence of physical transformation of initially vertical magnetic\nfield ${\\bf B}_{\\|}$, directed along the normal ${\\bf N}$ to the surface of\naccretion disk, into the horizontal (perpendicular to ${\\bf N}$) one. We found\nasymptotical analytical expressions for axially averaged polarization degree\n$p$ and mean position angle $\\chi$ for various types of magnetized accretion\ndisks.

This rotation may occur during fairly great cosmological time\n(corresponding to $\\Delta z\\sim 1-2$). The part of rotation $\\sim \\Delta \\chi\n\\approx 45^{\\circ}$ can be explained by a mechanism of alignment of\npolarization vectors, say distribution of the part of quasars as a spiral in\nthe cosmic space with slow variation of rotation axis of corresponding\naccretion disks. Both mechanisms are mutually related one with another.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Nov 2009 11:56:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-17"}

Six of the\nsix galaxies observed were securely detected. High resolution observations\nresolve the CO emission in four of them, implying sizes of order of 6-11 kpc\nand suggesting the presence of rotation. The UV morphologies are consistent\nwith clumpy, unstable disks, and the UV sizes are consistent with the CO sizes.\nThe star formation efficiencies are homogeneously low and similar to local\nspirals - the resulting gas depletion times are ~0.5 Gyr, much higher than what\nis seen in high-z submm galaxies and quasars. The CO luminosities can be\npredicted to within 0.15 dex from the star formation rates and stellar masses,\nimplying a tight correlation of the gas mass with these quantities. We use\ndynamical models of clumpy disk galaxies to derive dynamical masses. These\nmodels are able to reproduce the peculiar spectral line shapes of the CO\nemission. After accounting for the stellar and dark matter masses we derive gas\nmasses of 0.4-1.2x10^11 Msun. The conversion factor is very high:\nalpha_CO=3.6+-0.8, consistent with the Galaxy but four times higher than that\nof local ultra-luminous IR galaxies. The gas accounts for an impressive 50-65%\nof the baryons within the galaxies' half light radii. We are witnessing truly\ngas-dominated galaxies at z~1.5, a finding that explains the high specific SFRs\nobserved for z>1 galaxies. The BzK galaxies can be viewed as scaled-up versions\nof local disk galaxies, with low efficiency star formation taking place inside\nextended, low excitation gas disks. They are markedly different than local\nULIRGs and high-z submm galaxies, which have more excited and compact gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Nov 2009 14:40:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2010 14:58:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}
