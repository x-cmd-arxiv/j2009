In particular, water vapor absorption lines\ncan be observed in a number of the near-infrared windows allowing measurement\nof the H2O abundance at several different levels in the lower atmosphere.\nAccurate determination of the abundance requires a good database of spectral\nline parameters for the H2O absorption lines at the high temperatures (up to\n~700 K) encountered in the Venus deep atmosphere. This paper presents a\ncomparison of a number of H2O line lists that have been, or that could\npotentially be used, to analyze Venus deep atmosphere water abundances and\nshows that there are substantial discrepancies between them. For example, the\nearly high-temperature list used by Meadows and Crisp (1996) had large\nsystematic errors in line intensities. When these are corrected for using the\nmore recent high-temperature BT2 list of Barber et al. (2006) their value of\n45+/-10 ppm for the water vapor mixing ratio reduces to 27+/-6 ppm. The HITRAN\nand GEISA lists used for most other studies of Venus are deficient in \"hot\"\nlines that become important in the Venus deep atmosphere and also show evidence\nof systematic errors in line intensities, particularly for the 8000 to 9500\ncm-1 region that includes the 1.18 um window. Water vapor mixing ratios derived\nfrom these lists may also be somewhat overestimated.

An observer of a dipolar\nsource cannot measure instantaneously all the energy and momentum effectively\nproduced along the own line of view because the source has not a spherical\nsymmetry. This physical circumstance has as consequence that the energy and\nmomentum localised inside the source zone is equivalent to one of a photon. The\nnew approach to quantisation appears to be a bridge between quantum mechanics\nand electromagnetic theory with many intriguing future develops.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Jan 2009 14:15:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-27"}

This implementation effort is reduced by program\ntransformation-based continuation call techniques, at some efficiency cost.\nHowever, the traditional formulation of this proposal by Ramesh and Cheng\nlimits the interleaving of tabled and non-tabled predicates and thus cannot be\nused as-is for arbitrary programs. In this paper we present a complete\ntranslation for the continuation call technique which, using the runtime\nsupport needed for the traditional proposal, solves these problems and makes it\npossible to execute arbitrary tabled programs. We present performance results\nwhich show that CCall offers a useful tradeoff that can be competitive with\nstate-of-the-art implementations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Jan 2009 15:40:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-27"}
