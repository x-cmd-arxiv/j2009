The improved technique results in an increased cooling rate and\ndecreases the minimum cooling temperature achievable with the optical shaker.\nThe modified shaker requires only one measurement of the force on the atoms\nbefore each cooling step, resulting in a simplification of the feedback\nelectronics. The force is inferred from the power variations of the transmitted\nlaser beams and is used to determine the best moment at which the cooling steps\nare applied. The temperature of the atomic system is automatically monitored,\nwhich allows maintaining an optimum cooling rate as the temperature decreases.\nThe improved shaker is simple to build, provides a faster rate of cooling, and\ncan work in the microkelvin regime. Numerical modeling shows a reduction by a\nfactor of three in the required number of phase jumps and a lower temperature\nlimit reduced by an order of magnitude compared to the initially proposed\nshaker.

Free\nenergy calculations were performed for ices VII and VIII and for the fluid\nphase to determine the melting curve of these ices. In addition molecular\ndynamics simulations were performed at high temperatures (440K) observing the\nspontaneous freezing of the liquid into a solid phase at pressures of about\n80000 bar. The analysis of the structure obtained lead to the conclusion that a\nplastic crystal phase was formed. In the plastic crystal phase the oxygen atoms\nwere arranged forming a body center cubic structure, as in ice VII, but the\nwater molecules were able to rotate almost freely. Free energy calculations\nwere performed for this new phase, and it was found that for TIP4P/2005 this\nplastic crystal phase is thermodynamically stable with respect to ices VII and\nVIII for temperatures higher than about 400K, although the precise value\ndepends on the pressure. By using Gibbs Duhem simulations, all coexistence\nlines were determined, and the phase diagram of the TIP4P/2005 model was\nobtained, including ices VIII and VII and the new plastic crystal phase. The\nTIP4P/2005 model is able to describe qualitatively the phase diagram of water.\nIt would be of interest to study if such a plastic crystal phase does indeed\nexist for real water. The nearly spherical shape of water makes possible the\nformation of a plastic crystal phase at high temperatures. The formation of a\nplastic crystal phase at high temperatures (with a bcc arrangements of oxygen\natoms) is fast from a kinetic point of view occurring in about 2ns.

Through\npost-processing we investigate what kinds of feedback would be required to\nreproduce observed galaxy masses and star formation rates. To mimic an extreme\nform of \"preventive\" feedback (e.g., AGN radio mode) we remove all baryonic\nmass that was originally accreted via \"hot mode\" from shock-heated gas. This\ndoes not bring the high mass end of the galaxy mass function into agreement\nwith observations because much of the stellar mass in these systems formed at\nhigh redshift from baryons that originally accreted via \"cold mode\" onto lower\nmass progenitors. An efficient \"ejective\" feedback mechanism, such as supernova\ndriven winds, must reduce the masses of these progenitors. Feedback must also\nreduce the masses of lower mass z=0 galaxies, which assemble at lower redshifts\nand have much lower star formation rates. If we monotonically re-map galaxy\nmasses to reproduce the observed mass function, but retain the simulation's\npredicted star formation rates, we obtain fairly good agreement with the\nobserved sequence of star-forming galaxies but fail to recover the observed\npopulation of passive, low star formation rate galaxies. Suppressing all hot\nmode accretion improves agreement for high mass galaxies but worsens the\nagreement at intermediate masses. Reproducing these z=0 observations requires a\nfeedback mechanism that dramatically suppresses star formation in a fraction of\ngalaxies, increasing with mass, while leaving star formation rates of other\ngalaxies essentially unchanged.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jan 2009 21:00:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 May 2009 00:56:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

During\nthis process, the residual energy of each ionizing photon is deposited in the\nIGM as heat, increasing its temperature to 20,000-30,000 K; subsequent\nexpansion of the Universe then cools the gas. Because reionization most likely\nproceeds from high to low densities, underdense voids are ionized last, have\nless time to cool, and are (on average) warmer than mean-density gas\nimmediately after reionization is complete (an \"inverted\" equation of state).\n  From this initial configuration, the low-density gas cools quickly and\neventually returns to a more normal equation of state. The rapidly evolving\ntemperature introduces systematic uncertainties in measurements of the ionizing\nbackground at z~6. For example, late reionization implies rapid cooling, so\nthat the ionizing background would have to evolve even more rapidly at z ~5-6\nthan typically claimed. This degeneracy is difficult to disentangle, because\nthe Lyman-alpha forest probes only a narrow range in densities (over which the\ngas is nearly isothermal). However, higher Lyman-series transitions probe wider\ndensity ranges, sampling different effective temperatures, and offer a new way\nto measure the IGM equation of state that should work where nearly saturated\nabsorption precludes other methods. This will help to separate evolution in\ntemperature from that in the ionizing background. While more detailed study\nwith hydrodynamic simulations is needed, we show that such measurements could\npotentially distinguish early and late reionization using only a handful of\nlines of sight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jan 2009 21:57:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The\nsignal-independent and bounded noise models used in the literature to analyze\nthe performance of compressed sensing do not accurately model the effects of\nPoisson noise. However, Poisson noise is an appropriate noise model for a\nvariety of applications, including low-light imaging, where sensing hardware is\nlarge or expensive, and limiting the number of measurements collected is\nimportant. In this paper, we describe how a feasible positivity-preserving\nsensing matrix can be constructed, and then analyze the performance of a\ncompressed sensing reconstruction approach for Poisson data that minimizes an\nobjective function consisting of a negative Poisson log likelihood term and a\npenalty term which could be used as a measure of signal sparsity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jan 2009 22:35:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Feb 2009 17:51:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2009 15:22:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-30"}

The difficulties in solving the\ntheory at low energies in the strongly interacting, non-perturbative regime\nhave left unanswered many important questions in QCD, such as the nature of\nconfinement or the mechanism of hadronization. In these lectures oriented\ntowards the students we introduce two classes of dualities that attempt to\nreproduce many of the features of QCD, while making the treatment at strong\ncoupling more tractable: (1) the AdS/CFT correspondence between a specific\nclass of string theories and a conformal field theory and (2) an effective\nlow-energy theory of QCD dual to classical QCD on a curved conformal\ngravitational background. The hope is that by applying these dualities to the\nevaluation of various properties of the strongly-interacting matter produced in\nheavy ion collisions one can understand how QCD behaves at strong coupling. We\ngive an outline of the applications, with emphasis on two transport\ncoefficients of QCD matter -- shear and bulk viscosities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jan 2009 22:55:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-22"}

We also consider the situation where the magnetic\nfield consists of an oscillatory as well as a linearly varying component, i.e.,\n$h(t) = h_0\\cos{\\omega t} + t/\\tau$. Our purpose is to estimate the defect\ndensity and the local entropy density in the final state if the system is\ninitially prepared in its ground state. For a single crossing through the\nquantum critical point with $h = h_0\\cos{\\omega t}$, the density of defects in\nthe final state is calculated by mapping the dynamics to an equivalent Landau\nZener problem by linearizing near the crossing point, and is found to vary as\n$\\sqrt{\\omega}$ in the limit of small $\\omega$. On the other hand, the local\nentropy density is found to attain a maximum as a function of $\\omega$ near a\ncharacteristic scale $\\omega_0$. Extending to the situation of multiple\ncrossings, we show that the non-trivial interference effects of certain\nresonance modes solely contribute to the production of defects. Kink density as\nwell as the diagonal entropy density show oscillatory dependence on the number\nof full cycles of oscillation. Finally, the inclusion of a linear term in the\ntransverse field on top of the oscillatory component, results to a kink density\nwhich decreases continuously with $\\tau$ and $\\omega$. The entropy density\nshows monotonous growth with both $\\tau$ and $\\omega$, in sharp contrast to the\nsituations studied earlier.

We examine the behavior of the electroweak phase\ntransition based on the effective renormalizable Yukawa theory which consists\nof the fourth-family quarks and two SU(2)-doublet Higgs fields corresponding to\nthe bilinear operators of the fourth-family quarks with/without imposing the\ncompositeness condition. The strength of the first-order phase transition is\nestimated by using the finite-temperature effective potential at one-loop with\nthe ring-improvement. In the Yukawa theory without the compositeness condition,\nit is found that there is a parameter region where the first-order phase\ntransition is strong enough for the electroweak baryogenesis with the\nexperimentally acceptable Higgs boson and fourth-family quark masses. On the\nother hand, when the compositeness condition is imposed, the phase transition\nturns out to be weakly first order, or possibly second order, although the\nresult is rather sensitive to the details of the compositeness condition.\nCombining with the result of the Yukawa theory without the compositeness\ncondition, it is argued that with the fourth-family quark masses in the range\nof 330-480 GeV, corresponding to the compositeness scale in the range of\n1.0-2.3 TeV, the four-fermion interaction among the fourth-family quarks does\nnot lead to the strongly first-order electroweak phase transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jan 2009 15:30:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Jan 2009 20:48:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-19"}

The source is characterized by very rapid (on timescales even\nlower than a day) changes of the column density of an inner absorber, together\nwith the presence of constant components arising as reprocessing from a\nCompton-thick material. The best fitting scenario implies important\nmodifications to the zeroth order view of Unified Models. While the existence\nof a pc-scale torus is needed in order to produce a constant Compton reflection\ncomponent and an iron K$\\alpha$ emission line, in this Seyfert 2 galaxy this is\nnot viewed along the line of sight. On the other hand, the absorption of the\nprimary continuum is due to another material, much closer to the BH, roughly at\nthe distance of the BLR, which can produce the observed rapid spectral\nvariability. On top of that, the constant presence of a $10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$\ncolumn density can be ascribed to the presence of a dust lane, extended on a\ngalactic scale, as previously confirmed by Chandra. There is now mounting\nevidence that complexity in the obscuration of AGN may be the rule rather than\nthe exception.

Using the framework of Maximum A\nPosteriori inversion, it aims at recovering the full-sky convergence map from\nsurveys with masks. It proceeds in two steps: CCD images of crowded galactic\nfields are deblurred using automated edge-preserving deconvolution; once the\nreduced shear is estimated, the convergence map is also inverted via an edge-\npreserving method. For the deblurring, it is found that when the observed field\nis crowded, this gain can be quite significant for realistic ground-based\nsurveys when both positivity and edge-preserving penalties are imposed during\nthe iterative deconvolution. For the convergence inversion, the quality of the\nreconstruction is investigated on noisy maps derived from the horizon N-body\nsimulation, with and without Galactic cuts, and quantified using one-point\nstatistics, power spectra, cluster counts, peak patches and the skeleton. It is\nfound that the reconstruction is able to interpolate and extrapolate within the\nGalactic cuts/non-uniform noise; its sharpness-preserving penalization avoids\nstrong biasing near the clusters of the map; it reconstructs well the shape of\nthe PDF as traced by its skewness and kurtosis; the geometry and topology of\nthe reconstructed map is close to the initial map as traced by the peak patch\ndistribution and the skeleton's differential length; the two-points statistics\nof the recovered map is consistent with the corresponding smoothed version of\nthe initial map; the distribution of point sources is also consistent with the\ncorresponding smoothing, with a significant improvement when edge preserving\nprior is applied. The contamination of B-modes when realistic Galactic cuts are\npresent is also investigated.

This may indicate that not all AGNs have\ncospatial regions of optical and radio emission in their jets. However, another\npossibility is that some of the 7mm-2cm VLBA cores have Faraday rotations of\nthe order of several tens of thousand of rad/m^2, which were not properly fit\nby our three-frequency data due to n*pi ambiguities in the observed\npolarization angles, leading to incorrect subtraction of the effects of the\ncore Faraday rotation, and so incorrect \"zero-wavelength\" radio polarization\nangles.

One possible\nreason for the weak suppression of ITG turbulence by zonal flows found in\nexperiments in the Columbia Linear Machine (CLM) [Phys. Plasmas {\\bf 13} 055905\n(2006)] might be due to the small toroidicity ($\\epsilon_n = 2L_n/R$) in the\nexperiment. The zonal flow is often directly dependent on the ITG mode and the\ncoupling of zonal flow to acoustic modes and hence is directly affected by any\nchange of the relevant parameters. The model consists of the continuity,\ntemperature and parallel ion momentum equations for the ITG turbulence. The\nzonal flow time evolution is described by a Hasegawa-Mima like equation and a\nfifth order zonal flow dispersion relation is derived. The results are\ninterpreted in terms of quality of zonal flows, i.e., the ratio of growth rate\nand real frequency ($Q = \\Omega^{IM}/\\Omega^{RE}$). It is found that the\nquality of the zonal flow rapidly decreases with decreasing toroidicity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jan 2009 15:30:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We select our sample from the deepest near-UV image\nobtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) using the WFPC2 (F300W) as part\nof the parallel observations of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field campaign\noverlapping with the HST/ACS GOODS dataset. We perform single component Sersic\nfits in both WFPC2/F300W (rest-frame UV) and ACS/F850LP (rest-frame optical)\nbands and deduce that the Sersic index $n$ is estimated to be smaller in the\nrest-frame UV compared to the rest-frame optical, leading to an overestimation\nof the number of merger candidates by ~40-100% compared to the rest-frame\noptical depending upon the cutoff in $n$ employed for identifying merger\ncandidates. This effect seems to be dominated by galaxies with low values of\nn(F300W) <= 0.5 that have a value of n(F850LP) ~ 1.0. We argue that these\nobjects are probably clumpy starforming galaxies or minor mergers, both of\nwhich are essentially contaminants, if one is interested in identifying major\nmergers.\n  In addition we also find evidence that the axis ratio b/a is lower, i.e.\nellipticity (1-b/a) is higher in rest-frame UV compared to the rest-frame\noptical. Moreover, we find that in the rest-frame UV, the number of high\nellipticity (e >= 0.8) objects are higher by a factor of ~2.8 compared to the\nrest-frame optical. This indicates that the reported dominance of elongated\nmorphologies among high-z LBGs might just be a bias related to the use of\nrest-frame UV datasets in high-z studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jan 2009 15:57:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}
