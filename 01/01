We demonstrate how the area covered by the hotspot at the neutron\nstar surface is decreasing in the course of the outburst together with the\nreflection amplitude. These trends are in agreement with the natural scenario,\nwhere the disc inner edge is receding from the neutron star as the mass\naccretion rate drops. These findings are further supported by the variations of\nthe pulse profiles, which clearly show the presence of the secondary maximum at\nthe late stages of the outburst after October 29. This fact can be interpreted\nas the disc receding sufficiently far from the neutron star to open the view of\nthe lower magnetic pole. In that case, the disc inner radius can be estimated.\nAssuming that disc is truncated at the Alfv\\'en radius, we constrain the\nstellar magnetic moment to \\mu=(9\\pm5) 10^{25} G cm^3, which corresponds to the\nsurface field of 10^8 G. On the other hand, using the magnetic moment recently\nobtained from the observed pulsar spin-down rate we show that the disc edge has\nto be within factor of two of the Alfv\\'en radius, putting interesting\nconstraints on the models of the disc-magnetosphere interaction. We also\ndemonstrate that the sharp changes in the phase of the fundamental are\nintimately related to the variations of the pulse profile, which we associate\nwith the varying obscuration of the antipodal spot.

High angular resolution N-band imaging is used to discern the torus of\nactive galactic nuclei (AGN) from its environment in order to allow a\ncomparison of its mid-infrared properties to the expectations of the unified\nscenario for AGN.

We find\nthat at a resolution of ~ 0.35\", all the nuclei of our observed sources are\npoint-like, except for 2 objects whose extension is likely of instrumental\norigin.

Since thermal emission from dust\ngrains dominates the spectral energy distribution at the sub-mm/FIR regime,\ndust grains are thought to be the cause of the polarization. We discuss grain\nalignment by radiation and we explore the efficiency of dust alignment in T\nTauri disks.

We discuss some of the major advances, which include, first\nof all, formulating of the analytical model of RATs. This model was shown to\nreproduce well the torques acting on actual irregular dust grains and allowed\nstudies of the parameter space for which the alignment happens with long axes\nperpendicular and parallel to the magnetic field. Such a study resulted in an\nimportant conclusion that, without any paramagnetic relaxation, the RAT\nalignment always happens for interstellar grains with long axes perpendicular\nto the magnetic field. We show that the gaseous bombardment in some cases\nincreases the degree of alignment by knocking out grains from the positions of\nimperfect alignment when the grains rotate slowly to more stable positions of\nperfect alignment where grains rotate fast. In terms of pinwheel torques,\nimportant revisions have been made in the Lazarian and Draine model of grain\nflipping and thermal trapping. Those, however, do not change the major\nconclusion that very small grains (i.e. grain size smaller than ~0.03 micron)\nshould be marginally aligned. Recent work made the RAT alignment a predictive\ntheory which is ready for quantitative modeling of astrophysical polarization.\nWe predict that the microwave emission from the Zodiacal dust presents an\nimportant contaminant, which should be included into foreground polarization\ntemplates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Dec 2008 21:09:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-21"}

For this they accept to move\non a longer path with some distance to the corner, to avoid large densities and\nby this succeed in maintaining a comparatively high speed. In many models of\npedestrian dynamics the basic rule of motion is often either \"move as far as\npossible toward the destination\" or - reformulated - \"of all coordinates\naccessible in this time step move to the one with the smallest distance to the\ndestination\". Atop of this rule modifications are placed to make the motion\nmore realistic. These modifications usually focus on local behavior and neglect\nlong-ranged effects. Compared to real pedestrians this leads to agents in a\nsimulation valuing the shortest path a lot better than the quickest. So, in a\nsituation as the movement of a large crowd around a corner, one needs an\nadditional element in a model of pedestrian dynamics that makes the agents\ndeviate from the rule of the shortest path. In this work it is shown, how this\ncan be achieved by using a flood fill dynamic potential field method, where\nduring the filling process the value of a field cell is not increased by 1, but\nby a larger value, if it is occupied by an agent. This idea may be an obvious\none, however, the tricky part - and therefore in a strict sense the\ncontribution of this work - is a) to minimize unrealistic artifacts, as naive\nflood fill metrics deviate considerably from the Euclidean metric and in this\nrespect yield large errors, b) do this with limited computational effort, and\nc) keep agents' movement at very low densities unaltered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jan 2009 09:29:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-28"}
