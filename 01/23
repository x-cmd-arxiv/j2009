We find that\nwithin 150 kpc of the radio galaxy the stellar mass is centrally concentrated\nin the radio galaxy, yet most of the dust-uncorrected, instantaneous star\nformation occurs in the surrounding low-mass satellite galaxies. We predict\nthat most of the galaxies within 150 kpc of the radio galaxy will merge with\nthe central radio galaxy by z = 0, increasing its stellar mass by up to a\nfactor of ~ 2. However, it will take several hundred Myr for the first mergers\nto occur, by which time the large star formation rates are likely to have\nexhausted the gas reservoirs in the satellite galaxies. The tidal radii of the\nsatellite galaxies are small, suggesting that stars and gas are being stripped\nand deposited at distances of tens of kpc from the central radio galaxy. These\nstripped stars may become intracluster stars or form an extended stellar halo\naround the radio galaxy, such as those observed around cD galaxies in cluster\ncores.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jan 2009 16:37:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We also report the first simultaneous UBVRI photometry of\nthe newly identified intermediate polar 1RXS J173021.5-055933. Conclusions.\nCircular polarization may be ubiquitous in intermediate polars, albeit at a low\nlevel of one or two percent or less. It is stronger at longer wavelengths in\nthe visible spectrum. Our results lend further support to the possible link\nbetween the presence of soft X-ray components and the detectability of circular\npolarization in intermediate polars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jan 2009 17:32:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We find, in\nagreement with earlier works of Tully & Verheijen and ours for Ursa Major\ncluster galaxies, a clear dichotomy between high and low surface brightness\ngalaxy disks. The difference between the low and high brightness peaks of Virgo\ndisk galaxies is ~2 H-mag arcsec^-2, significantly larger than any systematic\nerrors. The high surface brightness disk galaxies have two distinct classes of\nhigh and low concentration bulges, while low surface brightness galaxies have\nonly low concentration bulges. Early-type galaxies exhibit a similar structural\nbimodality though offset from that of the spiral galaxies towards higher\nsurface brightnesses. Both the early- and late-type structural bimodalities are\nuncorrelated with colour or any other structural parameter except, possibly,\ncircular velocity. The structural bimodality may be linked to dynamical\nproperties of galaxies. Low angular momentum systems may collapse to form\ndynamically important disks with high surface brightness, while high angular\nmomentum systems would end up as low surface brightness galaxies dominated by\nthe dark halo at all radii.

We\nperformed the first deep near-IR (NIR) observations (Ks band) of 1E 1547.0-5408\nwith the VLT on three nights (July 8th, 12th, and August 17th), after the X-ray\nsource rebrightening and during the subsequent decay reported around June 2007.\nWe detected four objects within, or close to, the 3sigma radio position of 1E\n1547.0-5408.

The\nfirst scaling is s/p ratios are almost constant over a wide range of the atomic\nnumber, where the p-nculei are lighter than the s-nuclei by two or four\nneutrons. The second scaling is p/p ratios are almost constant, where the\nsecond $p$-nuclei are lighter than the first p-nucleus by two neutrons. These\nscalings are a piece of evidence that most p-nuclei are dominantly synthesized\nby the gamma-process in supernova explosions. The scalings lead to a novel\nconcept of \"universality of gamma-process\" that the s/p and p/p ratios of\nnuclei produced by individual gamma-processes are almost constant,\nrespectively. We have calculated the ratios by gamma-process based on\ncore-collapse supernova explosion models under various astrophysical conditions\nand found that the scalings hold for materials produced by individual\ngamma-processes independent of the astrophysical conditions assumed. The\nuniversality originates from three mechanisms: the shifts of the gamma-process\nlayers to keep their peak temperature, the weak s-process in pre-supernovae,\nand the independence of the s/p ratios of the nuclear reactions. The results\nfurther suggest an extended universality that the s/p ratios in the\ngamma-process layers are not only constant but also centered on a specific\nvalue of 3. With this specific value and the first scaling, we estimate that\nthe ratios of $s$-process abundance contributions from the AGB stars to the\nmassive stars are almost 6.7 for the $s$-nuclei of A > 90. We find that large\nenhancements of s/p ratios for Ce, Er, and W are a piece of evidence that the\nweak s-process actually occurred before SNe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jan 2009 02:35:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

Nash\nEquilibrium is a central concept in game theory, which offers the mathematical\nfoundation for social science and economy. However, the original definition is\ndeclarative without including a solution to find them. It has been found later\nthat it is computationally difficult to find a Nash equilibrium. Furthermore, a\nNash equilibrium may be unstable, sensitive to the smallest variation of payoff\nfunctions. Making the situation worse, a society with selfish individuals can\nhave an enormous number of equilibria, making it extremely hard to find out the\nglobal optimal one. This paper offers a constructive generalization of Nash\nequilibrium to cover the case when the selfishness of individuals are reduced\nto lower levels in a controllable way. It shows that the society has one and\nonly one equilibrium when the selfishness is reduced to a certain level. When\nevery individual follows the iterative, soft-decision optimization process\npresented in this paper, the society converges to the unique equilibrium with\nan exponential rate under any initial conditions. When it is a consensus\nequilibrium at the same time, it must be the global optimum. The study of this\npaper suggests that, to build a good, stable society (including the financial\nmarket) for the benefit everyone in it, the pursuing of maximal payoff by each\nindividual should be controlled at some level either by voluntary good\ncitizenship or some proper regulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jan 2009 07:40:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-26"}

The second problem\nconcerns odd-electron character of the components. Similarly to high aromatics\nand fullerenes, much larger C-C distances provide a considerable weakening of\nodd electrons interaction in nanotubes and graphene that necessitates taking\nthe configurational interaction of odd electrons into account. Avoiding a\nsevere complication, the broken spin-symmetry approach makes the problem\nfeasible. Moreover, unrestricted broken-symmetry Hartree-Fock approach\npossesses a unique sensitivity in revealing enhanced chemical activity of the\nspecies caused by their partial radicalization in terms of atomic chemical\nsusceptibility. The chemical susceptibility profiles along the tube and across\ntheir body as well as over graphene sheets form the ground of computational\nsynthesis of graphen-nanotube composites in due course of the relevant addition\nreactions and make it possible to select two main groups of the composites,\nconditionally called hammer and cutting-blade structures.

Thus, in diluted solutions where the first requirement\nis met, one can expect the formation of the multi-addend cutting-blade\ncomposites.

Our approach to\nanalyzing SPNs is information theoretic. We define an SPN as a network with\nmultiple nodes that each produce noisy and compressed measurements of the same\ninformation. An SPN must combine all these measurements into a single further\ncompressed network output, in a way dictated solely by naturally occurring\nphysical properties -- i.e. pooling -- and yet causes no (or negligible)\nreduction in mutual information. This means SPNs exhibit redundancy reduction\nas an emergent property of pooling. The SPN concept is applicable to examples\nin biological neural coding, nano-electronics, distributed sensor networks,\ndigital beamforming arrays, image processing, multiaccess communication\nnetworks and social networks. In most cases the randomness is assumed to be\nunavoidably present rather than deliberately introduced. We illustrate the\ncentral properties of SPNs for several case studies, where pooling occurs by\nsummation, including nodes that are noisy scalar quantizers, and nodes with\nconditionally Poisson statistics. Other emergent properties of SPNs and some\nunsolved problems are also briefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jan 2009 10:38:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-26"}

The main difficulty is in determining the\nrequired parameters for intermediate and high redshift galaxies.\n  This work aims to identify the main problems of the study of the Tully-Fisher\nrelation at high redshift using optical emission lines, in order to draw\nconclusions about the possible evolution of this relation in the B, R, and\nI-bands.\n  With this aim, the rotational velocities obtained from the widths of\ndifferent optical lines using DEEP2 spectra are compared. Morphology has been\ndetermined via HST images, using and comparing different methodologies.\nInstrumental magnitudes are then corrected for K and extinction and the\nabsolute magnitudes derived for the concordance cosmological model. Finally,\nthe optical Tully-Fisher relations in B, R, and I-bands at different redshifts\nup to z = 1.3 are derived.\n  Although most studies (this one included) find evidence of evolution, the\nresults are not conclusive enough, since the possible luminosity evolution is\nwithin the scattering of the relation, and the evolution in slope is difficult\nto determine because at high redshift only the brightest galaxies can be\nmeasured. Nevertheless, our study shows a clear tendency, which is the same for\nall bands studied, that favours a luminosity evolution where galaxies were\nbrighter in the past for the same rotation velocity. This result also implies\nthat the colour of the Tully-Fisher relation does not change with redshift,\nsupporting the collapse model versus the accretion model of disc galaxy\nformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jan 2009 15:24:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2009 16:58:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In this paper we analyse numerically the propagation and dispersion of\nacoustic waves in the solar-like sub-photosphere with localised non-uniform\nmagnetic field concentrations, mimicking sunspots with various representative\nmagnetic field configurations. Methods. Numerical simulations of wave\npropagation through the solar sub-photosphere with a localised magnetic field\nconcentration are carried out using SAC, which solves the MHD equations for\ngravitationally stratified plasma. The initial equilibrium density and pressure\nstratifications are derived from a standard solar model. Acoustic waves are\ngenerated by a source located at the height approximately corresponding to the\nvisible surface of the Sun. We analyse the response of vertical velocity to\nchanges in the interior due to magnetic field at the level corresponding to the\nvisible solar surface, by the means of local time-distance helioseismology.\nResults. The results of numerical simulations of acoustic wave propagation and\ndispersion in the solar sub-photosphere with localised magnetic field\nconcentrations of various types are presented. Time-distance diagrams of the\nvertical velocity perturbation at the level corresponding to the visible solar\nsurface show that the magnetic field perturbs and scatters acoustic waves and\nabsorbs the acoustic power of the wave packet.

The point of\nview taken in these lectures is mostly algebro-geometric but no prior knowledge\nof algebraic geometry is assumed. After introducing the necessary mathematical\ndefinitions, we discuss the construction of toric varieties as holomorphic\nquotients. We discuss the resolution and deformation of toric Calabi-Yau\nsingularities. We also explain the gauged linear sigma-model (GLSM) Kahler\nquotient construction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jan 2009 15:14:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 May 2009 09:58:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-08"}
