The fraction of broad line\nobjects among gRSs with high excitation spectrum is the same as for the RSs\nfrom isotropic samples. According to Unified Scheme this leads to the isotropic\nangle distribution of gRSs jets, thus gRSs cannot be characterized as objects\nwith jets lying in the plane of sky. 2. gRSs do not differ from normal sized\nRSs in apparent asymmetry distribution of their extended radio components\n(ERC). However the fact that asymmetry distributions for gRSs and giant radio\nquasars (gQSS) are essentially the same leads within the Unification Scheme to\nthe conclusion that the origin of this asymmetry is in the non-uniform\nenvironment. 3.

Its radio through submm-wave emission\nis known to come from a region close to the event horizon, however, the source\nof the emission is still under debate. A successful theory explaining the\nemission is based on a relativistic jet model scaled down from powerful\nquasars. We want to test the predictive power of this established jet model\nagainst newly available measurements of wavelength-dependent time lags and the\nsize-wavelength structure in Sgr A*. Using all available closure amplitude VLBI\ndata from different groups, we again derived the intrinsic wavelength-dependent\nsize of Sgr A*. This allowed us to calculate the expected frequency-dependent\ntime lags of radio flares, assuming a range of in- and outflow velocities.\nMoreover, we calculated the time lags expected in the previously published\npressure-driven jet model. The predicted lags are then compared to radio\nmonitoring observations at 22, 43, and 350 GHz. The combination of time lags\nand size measurements imply a mildly relativistic outflow with bulk outflow\nspeeds of gamma*beta ~ 0.5-2. The newly measured time lags are reproduced well\nby the jet model without any major fine tuning. The results further strengthen\nthe case for the cm-to-mm wave radio emission in Sgr A* as coming from a mildly\nrelativistic jet-like outflow. The combination of radio time lag and VLBI\nclosure amplitude measurements is a powerful new tool for assessing the flow\nspeed and direction in Sgr A*. Future VLBI and time lag measurements over a\nrange of wavelengths will reveal more information about Sgr A*, such as the\nexistence of a jet nozzle, and measure the detailed velocity structure of a\nrelativistic jet near its launching point for the first time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jan 2009 16:54:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

To\ndeal with this hardness result, we present a constant-factor approximation when\nthe optimal profit significantly exceeds the cost. This algorithm is based on\nrounding a natural LP formulation of the problem. Finally, we study a budgeted\nvariant of the problem, and show that in the query language model, one can find\ntwo budget constrained ad campaigns in polynomial time that implement the\noptimal bidding strategy. Our results are the first to address bid optimization\nunder the broad match feature which is common in ad auctions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jan 2009 19:09:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-26"}

In this review, we summarize the main results of our and other\ngroups in this field and clarify that surface functionalization is critical to\nthe behaviors of carbon nanotubes in biological systems. Ultra-sensitive\ndetection of biological species with carbon nanotubes can be realized after\nsurface passivation to inhibit the non-specific binding of bio-molecules on the\nhydrophobic nanotube surface. Electrical nanosensors based on nanotubes provide\na label-free approach to biological detections. Surface enhanced Raman\nspectroscopy of CNT opens up a method of protein microarray with down to 1 fM\ndetection sensitivity. In vitro and in vivo toxicity studies reveal that well\nwater soluble and serum stable nanotubes are biocompatible, non-toxic and\npotentially useful for biomedical applications. In vivo biodistributions vary\nwith the functionalization and possibly also sizes of nanotubes, with a\ntendency of accumulation in the reticuloendothelial systems, including the\nliver and spleen, after intravenous administration.

We perform a non-parametric inversion of galaxy counts at\n15, 24, 70, 160, and 850 microns simultaneously. It is a \"blind\" search (no\nredshift information is required) of all possible evolutions of the infrared\nluminosity function of galaxies, from which the evolution of the star-formation\nrate density and its uncertainties are derived. The cosmic infrared background\n(CIRB) measurements are used a posteriori to tighten the range of solutions.\nThe inversion relies only on two hypotheses: (1) the luminosity function\nremains smooth both in redshift and luminosity, (2) a set of infrared spectral\nenergy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies must be assumed. The range of\nstar-formation histories that we derive is well constrained and consistent with\nredshift-based measurements from deep surveys. The redshift decompositions of\nthe counts are also recovered successfully. Therefore, multi-wavelength counts\nand CIRB (both projected observations) alone seem to contain enough information\nto recover the cosmic star-formation history with quantifiable errors. A peak\nof the SFRD at z~2 is preferred, although higher redshifts are not excluded. We\nalso find a good consistency between the observed evolution of the stellar mass\ndensity and the prediction from our model. Finally, the inability of the\ninversion to model perfectly and simultaneously all the multi-wavelength\ninfrared counts (especially at 160 microns where an excess is seen around 20\nmJ) implies either (i) the existence of a sub-population of colder galaxies,\n(ii) a larger dispersion of dust temperatures among local galaxies than\nexpected, (iii) or a redshift evolution of the infrared SEDs of galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jan 2009 21:13:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2009 15:24:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2009 09:01:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

We shall explain these problems and the solution we proposed\nfor them. The first part is dedicated to the two-index representation. Here the\nchallenge is to identify the correct particle in the spectrum that has to be\nidentified with the Skyrmion. It turns out not to be the simplest baryon (as in\nordinary QCD) but a baryonic state with higher charge, precisely composed by\nn(n\\pm 1)/2 quarks. Although not the simplest among the baryons, it is the one\nthat minimizes the mass per unit of baryonic charge and thus is the most stable\namong them. The second part is devoted to the quarks in the adjoint\nrepresentation. The task here assume a different perspective. We do not have a\nbaryon charge, like in ordinary QCD. An important role is now played by a\nmassive fermion that must be considered in the low-energy effective Lagrangian.\nThrough this fermion, the Skyrmion acquires an anomalous fermionic number\n(-1)^F and, as a consequence, an odd relationship between the latter and its\nspin/statistic. This implies a Z_2 stability of the Skyrmion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jan 2009 23:58:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 Mar 2009 20:51:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-21"}

In a\nprevious paper, we proposed a self-doping mechanism as the origin of carrier\ndoping in n=3 and n=4; in the mechanism, electrons are transferred from the\ninner CuO_2 plane (IP) to the outer one (OP).

We note that the increase\nin the number of IPs from one to two leads to an increase in T_N due to\nstrengthening the interlayer coupling, although the doping levels for both\ncompounds are almost comparable. The present results strongly suggest that the\nuniform mixing of AFM and SC is a general property inherent to a single CuO_2\nplane in the underdoped regime for hole-doping.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Jan 2009 03:16:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In particular, we investigate\nthe dynamics of a migration from an unstable configuration into a stable one,\nwhich leads to a mini-collapse of the neutron star and excites sizeable\npulsations in its bulk until it acquires a new stable equilibrium state. We\nconsider equations of state with softening at high densities, a simple analytic\none with a mixed hadron-quark phase in an intermediate pressure interval and\npure quark matter at very high densities, and a microphysical one that has a\nfirst-order phase transition, originating from kaon condensation. Although the\nmarginally stable initial models are rigidly rotating, we observe that during\nthe collapse (albeit little) differential rotation is created. We analyze the\nemission of gravitational radiation, which in some models is amplified by mode\nresonance effects, and assess its prospective detectability by interferometric\ndetectors. We expect that the most favorable conditions for dynamic migration\nexist in very young magnetars. We find that the damping of the post-migration\npulsations strongly depends on the character of the equation of state\nsoftening. The damping of pulsations in the models with the microphysical\nequation of state is caused by dissipation associated with matter flowing\nthrough the density jump at the edge of the dense core.

The model can also account for branching, a traffic\nproperty caused by browser features such as tabs and the back button. The model\nreproduces aggregate traffic patterns such as site popularity, while also\ngenerating more accurate predictions of diversity, link traffic, and return\ntime distributions. This model for the first time allows us to capture the\nextreme heterogeneity of aggregate traffic measurements while explaining the\nmore narrowly focused browsing patterns of individual users.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Jan 2009 15:53:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-27"}
