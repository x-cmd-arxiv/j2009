Including this effective\nin-medium NN interaction, the Gamow-Teller matrix element vanishes for a\nnuclear density close to that of saturated nuclear matter. The genuine\nshort-range part of the three-nucleon interaction plays a particularly\nimportant role in this context, since the medium modifications to the pion\npropagator and pion-nucleon vertex (due to the long-range 3NF) tend to cancel\nout in the relevant observable.

We argue that cosmic ray diffusion is likely to be slow\ncompared to the buoyancy time on large length scales, so that cosmic rays are\neffectively adiabatic. If the cosmic ray pressure $p_{cr}$ is $\\gtrsim 25 %$ of\nthe thermal pressure, and the cosmic ray entropy ($p_{\\rm cr}/\\rho^{4/3}$;\n$\\rho$ is the thermal plasma density) decreases outwards, cosmic rays drive an\nadiabatic convective instability analogous to Schwarzschild convection in\nstars. Global simulations of galaxy cluster cores show that this instability\nsaturates by reducing the cosmic ray entropy gradient and driving efficient\nconvection and turbulent mixing. At larger radii in cluster cores, the thermal\nplasma is unstable to the heat flux-driven buoyancy instability (HBI), a\nconvective instability generated by anisotropic thermal conduction and a\nbackground conductive heat flux. Cosmic-ray driven convection and the HBI may\ncontribute to redistributing metals produced by Type 1a supernovae in clusters.\nOur calculations demonstrate that adiabatic simulations of galaxy clusters can\nartificially suppress the mixing of thermal and relativistic plasma;\nanisotropic thermal conduction allows more efficient mixing, which may\ncontribute to cosmic rays being distributed throughout the cluster volume.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jan 2009 01:19:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

The distinct features of spin-wave excitations in the\ntriangular-lattice antiferromagnet are (i) finite lifetime at zero temperature\ndue to spontaneous two-magnon decays, (ii) strong renormalization of magnon\nenergies with respect to the harmonic result, and (iii) logarithmic\nsingularities in the decay rate Gamma_k. Quantum corrections to the magnon\nspectrum are obtained using both the on-shell and off-shell solutions of the\nDyson equation with the lowest-order magnon self-energy. At low-energies magnon\nexcitations remain well-defined albeit with the anomalous decay rate Gamma_k ~\nk^2 at k->0 and Gamma_k ~ |k-Q_AF|^7/2 at k->Q_AF. At high energies, magnons\nare heavily damped with the decay rate reaching (2 Gamma_k/E_k) ~ 0.3 for the\ncase S=1/2. The on-shell solution shows logarithmic singularities in Gamma_k\nwith the concomitant jump-like discontinuities in E_k along certain contours in\nthe momentum space. Such singularities are even more prominent in the magnon\nspectral function A(k,w). Although the off-shell solution removes such\nlog-singularities, the decay rates remain strongly enhanced. We also discuss\nthe role of higher-order corrections and show that such singularities may lead\nto complete disappearance of the spectrum in the vicinity of certain k-points.\nThe kinematic conditions for two-magnon decays are analyzed for various\ngeneralizations of the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet as well as for the\nXXZ model on a kagome lattice.

SALT produces high-redshift Hubble residuals\nwith systematic trends versus color and larger scatter than MLCS2k2. MLCS2k2\noverestimates the intrinsic luminosity of SN Ia with 0.7 < Delta < 1.2. MLCS2k2\nwith R_V=3.1 overestimates host-galaxy extinction while R_V=1.7 does not. Our\ninvestigation is consistent with no Hubble bubble. We also find that, after\nlight-curve correction, SN Ia in Scd/Sd/Irr hosts are intrinsically fainter\nthan those in E/S0 hosts by 2 sigma, suggesting that they may come from\ndifferent populations. We also find that SN Ia in Scd/Sd/Irr hosts have low\nscatter (0.1 mag) and reddening. Current systematic errors can be reduced by\nimproving SN Ia photometric accuracy, by including the CfA3 sample to retrain\nlight-curve fitters, by combining optical SN Ia photometry with near-infrared\nphotometry to understand host-galaxy extinction, and by determining if\ndifferent environments give rise to different intrinsic SN Ia luminosity after\ncorrection for light-curve shape and color.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jan 2009 23:46:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Feb 2009 21:11:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 14 Jun 2009 03:54:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-22"}

It is known that the MIMO secrecy capacity is\nachievable with the optimal transmit covariance matrix that maximizes the\nminimum difference between the channel mutual information of the secrecy user\nand those of the eavesdroppers. The MIMO secrecy capacity computation can thus\nbe formulated as a non-convex max-min problem, which cannot be solved\nefficiently by standard convex optimization techniques. To handle this\ndifficulty, we explore a relationship between the MIMO secrecy channel and the\nrecently developed MIMO cognitive radio (CR) channel, in which the\nmulti-antenna secondary user transmits over the same spectrum simultaneously\nwith multiple primary users, subject to the received interference power\nconstraints at the primary users, or the so-called ``interference temperature\n(IT)'' constraints. By constructing an auxiliary CR MIMO channel that has the\nsame channel responses as the MIMO secrecy channel, we prove that the optimal\ntransmit covariance matrix to achieve the secrecy capacity is the same as that\nto achieve the CR spectrum sharing capacity with properly selected IT\nconstraints. Based on this relationship, several algorithms are proposed to\nsolve the non-convex secrecy capacity computation problem by transforming it\ninto a sequence of CR spectrum sharing capacity computation problems that are\nconvex. For the case with single-antenna eavesdroppers, the proposed algorithms\nobtain the exact capacity of the MIMO secrecy channel, while for the case with\nmulti-antenna eavesdroppers, the proposed algorithms obtain both upper and\nlower bounds on the MIMO secrecy capacity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jan 2009 06:56:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-02"}

If dwarf galaxies have a core dark matter halo\nwhich has constant density distribution in its center, the effect of dynamical\nfriction will be weakened considerably, and GCs should be able to survive\nbeyond the age of the universe. Then, the solution argued that, in a cored dark\nhalo, the suppression of dynamical friction is caused by a new equilibrium\nstate constructed by the interaction between the halo and the GC, in which a\npart of the halo rotates along with the GC (co-rotating state). In this study,\nI tested whether the solution is reasonable and reconsidered why a constant\ndensity, core halo suppresses dynamical friction, by means of N-body\nsimulations.

We compute the\ntransverse radii R_o and R_s as a function of p_t for various values of the\nKnudsen number, which measures the degree of thermalization in the system. They\nconverge to the hydrodynamical limit much more slowly (by a factor 3) than\nelliptic flow. This solves most of the HBT puzzle for central collisions:\nR_o/R_s is in the range 1.1-1.2 for realistic values of the Knudsen number,\nmuch closer to experimental data ($\\simeq 1$) than the value 1.5 from\nhydrodynamical calculations. The p_t dependence of R_o and R_s, which is\nusually said to reflect collective flow, also has a very limited sensitivity to\nthe degree of thermalization. We then study the azimuthal oscillations of R_o,\nR_s, and R_{os} for non central collisions. Their amplitudes depend little on\nthe Knudsen number, and reflect the eccentricity of the overlap area between\nthe two nuclei.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jan 2009 15:22:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 May 2009 13:47:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-30"}
