With rotation, the\nCoriolis force causes a sideways deflection of the flux of mean concentration.\nWithin the magnetohydrodynamics approximation there is no analogous effect from\nthe magnetic field because the effects on the flow do not depend on the sign of\nthe field. rotation and magnetic fields tend to suppress turbulent transport,\nbut this suppression is weaker in the direction along the magnetic field.\nTurbulent transport along the rotation axis is not strongly affected by\nrotation, except on shorter length scales, i.e., when the scale of the\nvariation of the mean field becomes comparable with the scale of the\nenergy-carrying eddies.

GCs beginning their\nformation have an initial metallicity determined by the pre-enrichment of their\nsurrounding protocloud, but can also undergo internal self-enrichment during\nformation. Stochastic variations in metallicity arise because of the finite\nnumbers of supernova. We construct an analytic formulation of the combined\neffects of pre-enrichment and self-enrichment and use Monte Carlo models to\nverify that the model accurately encapsulates the mean metallicity and\nmetallicity spread among real GCs. The predicted metallicity spread due to\nself-enrichment alone, a robust prediction of the model, is much smaller than\nthe observed spread among real GCs. This result rules out self-enrichment as a\nsignificant contributor to the metal content in most GCs, leaving\npre-enrichment as the viable alternative. Self-enrichment can, however, be\nimportant for clusters with masses well above 10^6 Msun, which are massive\nenough to hold in a significant fraction of their SN ejecta even without any\nexternal pressure confinement. This transition point corresponds well to the\nmass at which a mass-metallicity relationship (\"blue tilt\") appears in the\nmetal-poor cluster sequence in many large galaxies. We therefore suggest that\nself-enrichment is the primary driver for the mass-metallicity relation. Other\npredictions from our model are that the cluster-to-cluster metallicity spread\ndecreases amongst the highest mass clusters; and that the red GC sequence\nshould also display a more modest mass-metallicity trend if it can be traced to\nsimilarly high mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jan 2009 16:27:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

The vibrations induce a perturbation on this\nmotion, whose period is close to the orbital period, in agreement with the\nsimpler situation of the Shirokov effect \\cite{Shirokov:1973gr}. In general\nrelativity the amplitude of the perturbation is dominated by high velocity\neffects, which grow linearly in the radius $r$ of the circular orbit, while the\nleading term surviving the Newtonian limit decays as $1/r$.

Most of the ten systems in our sample have a minimum\nage difference of not larger than 0.5Gyr and their small orbital separation is\nhighly suggestive of at least one unstable mass transfer phase. However, a\nstable first mass transfer phase is feasible as the age difference is less then\n1Gyr. The results imply that unstable mass transfer is the most likely final\ncontact binary scenario to have occurred in DD systems but the first mass\ntransfer phase is not constrained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jan 2009 17:57:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-22"}

However,\nthese algorithms assume an idealized continuous-time CSMA protocol where\ncollisions can never occur. In addition, simulation results indicate that the\ndelay performance of these algorithms can be quite bad. On the other hand,\nalthough some simple heuristics (such as distributed approximations of greedy\nmaximal scheduling) can yield much better delay performance for a large set of\narrival rates, they may only achieve a fraction of the capacity region in\ngeneral. In this paper, we propose a discrete-time version of the CSMA\nalgorithm. Central to our results is a discrete-time distributed randomized\nalgorithm which is based on a generalization of the so-called Glauber dynamics\nfrom statistical physics, where multiple links are allowed to update their\nstates in a single time slot. The algorithm generates collision-free\ntransmission schedules while explicitly taking collisions into account during\nthe control phase of the protocol, thus relaxing the perfect CSMA assumption.\nMore importantly, the algorithm allows us to incorporate mechanisms which lead\nto very good delay performance while retaining the throughput-optimality\nproperty.

There are two known\nprocesses that can create these objects: direct stellar collisions and binary\nevolution. However, the relative importance of these processes has remained\nunclear. In particular, the total number of blue stragglers found in a given\ncluster does not seem to correlate with the predicted collision rate, providing\nindirect support for the binary-evolution model. Yet the radial distributions\nof blue stragglers in many clusters are bimodal, with a dominant central peak:\nthis has been interpreted as an indication that collisions do dominate blue\nstraggler production, at least in the high-density cluster cores. Here we\nreport that there is a clear, but sublinear, correlation between the number of\nblue stragglers found in a cluster core and the total stellar mass contained\nwithin it. From this we conclude that most blue stragglers, even those found in\ncluster cores, come from binary systems. The parent binaries, however, may\nthemselves have been affected by dynamical encounters.

The bars were detected using the ellipse fitting method and\nFourier analysis method. The ellipse fitting method was found to be more\nefficient in detecting bars in spiral galaxies. The fraction of barred galaxies\nturned out to be 45%. A bar was found in 29% of the lenticular galaxies, in 55%\nand 54% of the early- and late-type spirals, respectively. The bar length\n(normalised by the galaxy size) of late-type spirals is shorter than in\nearly-type or lenticular ones. A correlation between the bar length and galaxy\nsize was found with longer bars hosted by larger galaxies. The bars of the\nlenticular galaxies are weaker than those in spirals. Moreover, the unimodal\ndistribution of the bar strength found for all the galaxy types argues against\na quick transition between the barred and unbarred statues. There is no\ndifference between the local galaxy density of barred and unbarred galaxies.\nBesides, neither the length nor strength of the bars are correlated with the\nlocal density of the galaxy neighbourhoods. In contrast, a statistical\nsignificant difference between the central light concentration and colour of\nbarred and unbarred galaxies was found. Bars are mostly located in less\nconcentrated and bluer galaxies. These results indicate that the properties of\nbars are strongly related to those of their host galaxies, but do not depend on\nthe local environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jan 2009 21:01:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

More recent research has also identified scaling regularities in\nthe dynamics underlying the successive occurrences of events, suggesting the\npossibility of similar findings for language as well.\n  Methodology/Principal Findings: By considering frequent words in USENET\ndiscussion groups and in disparate databases where the language has different\nlevels of formality, here we show that the distributions of distances between\nsuccessive occurrences of the same word display bursty deviations from a\nPoisson process and are well characterized by a stretched exponential (Weibull)\nscaling. The extent of this deviation depends strongly on semantic type -- a\nmeasure of the logicality of each word -- and less strongly on frequency. We\ndevelop a generative model of this behavior that fully determines the dynamics\nof word usage.\n  Conclusions/Significance: Recurrence patterns of words are well described by\na stretched exponential distribution of recurrence times, an empirical scaling\nthat cannot be anticipated from Zipf's law.

Here we study the recent star formation\nhistories (SFHs) of three nearby dwarf galaxies to rigorously quantify the\nduration of their starburst events using a uniform and consistent approach. We\nfind that the bursts range from ~200 - ~400 Myr in duration resolving the\ntension between the shorter timescales often derived observationally with the\nlonger timescales derived from dynamical arguments. If these three starbursts\nare typical of starbursts in dwarf galaxies, then the short timescales (3 - 10\nMyr) associated with starbursts in previous studies are best understood as\n\"flickering\" events which are simply small components of the larger starburst.\nIn this sample of three nearby dwarfs, the bursts are not localized events. All\nthree systems show bursting levels of star formation in regions of both high\nand low stellar density. The enhanced star formation moves around the galaxy\nduring the bursts and covers a large fraction of the area of the galaxy. These\nmassive, long duration bursts can significantly affect the structure, dynamics,\nand chemical evolution of the host galaxy and can be the progenitors of\n\"superwinds\" that drive much of the recently chemically enriched material from\nthe galaxy into the intergalactic medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jan 2009 22:25:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

The evolution is governed by the interplay between smooth and clumpy\ncold streams, disk instability, and bulge formation. Intense, relatively smooth\nstreams maintain an unstable dense gas-rich disk. Instability with high\nturbulence and giant clumps, each a few percent of the disk mass, is\nself-regulated by gravitational interactions within the disk. The clumps\nmigrate into a bulge in ~10 dynamical times, or ~0.5Gyr. The cosmological\nstreams replenish the draining disk and prolong the clumpy phase to several\nGigayears in a steady state, with comparable masses in disk, bulge, and dark\nmatter within the disk radius. The clumps form stars in dense subclumps\nfollowing the overall accretion rate, ~100 Msun/yr, and each clump converts\ninto stars in ~0.5 Gyr. While the clumps coalesce dissipatively to a compact\nbulge, the star-forming disk is extended because the incoming streams keep the\nouter disk dense and susceptible to instability and because of angular momentum\ntransport. Passive spheroid-dominated galaxies form when the streams are more\nclumpy: the external clumps merge into a massive bulge and stir up disk\nturbulence that stabilize the disk and suppress in situ clump and star\nformation. We predict a bimodality in galaxy type by z~3, involving giant-clump\nstar-forming disks and spheroid-dominated galaxies of suppressed star\nformation. After z~1, the disks tend to be stabilized by the dominant stellar\ndisks and bulges. Most of the high-z massive disks are likely to end up as\ntoday's early-type galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jan 2009 11:10:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 May 2009 16:35:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 15 May 2009 15:38:55 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2009 05:31:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-28"}

These data are then generalised to all\ntemperatures and humidities by invoking the property of multiplicative\nseparability, as well as by converting established relationships in terms of\nconstant humidity at fixed temperature, to alternatives in terms of a\ncalculated water loss. In this way a formulation which is a series of very\nsimple, first order, ordinary differential equations is devised. The model is\nextended to include a variety of Glossina species using their relative surface\nareas, their relative pupal and puparial loss rates and their different 4th\ninstar excretions. The resulting computational model calculates total, pupal\nwater loss, consequent mortality and emergence. Remaining fat reserves are a\nmore tenuous result.\n  The model suggests that, while conventional wisdom is often correct in\ndismissing variability in transpiration-related pupal mortality as\ninsignificant, the effects of transpiration can be profound under adverse\nconditions and for some species, in general. The model demonstrates how two\ngender effects, the more significant one at the drier extremes of tsetse fly\nhabitat, might arise.

Applications range\nfrom quark matter to the high temperature superconductors. A wide class of\nHamiltonians, comprising interactions and hybridization of arbitrary momentum\ndependence between different fermion species, can be treated in a comprehensive\nmanner. This is the case, as both the intra-species and the inter-species\ninteractions are treated on equally rigorous footing, which is accomplished via\nthe introduction of a new quantum index attached to the fermions. The index is\nconsistent with known fermionic physics, and allows for heretofore unaccounted\nfor fermion-fermion correlations. We have derived the finite temperature\nversion of the theory, thus obtaining the renormalized quasiparticle dispersion\nrelations, and we discuss the appearance of charge and spin density wave order.\n  We present numerical solutions for two electron species in 2 dimensions.\nBased on these solutions, we show that, for equivalent spin up and down\nfermions, the Fermi occupation factor (per spin) equals 1/2 deep in the Fermi\nsea.

We discuss higher order corrections, we review and compare different\napproaches to small x resummation, and we assess the possible relevance of\nparton saturation in the determination of PDFS at HERA and its possible study\nin LHC processes. We provide various benchmarks of PDF fits, with the specific\naim of studying issues of error propagation, non-gaussian uncertainties, choice\nof functional forms of PDFs, and combination of data from different experiments\nand different processes. We study the impact of combined HERA (ZEUS-H1)\nstructure function data, their impact on PDF uncertainties, and their\nimplications for the computation of standard candle processes, and we review\nthe recent F_L determination at HERA. Finally, we compare and assess methods\nfor luminosity measurements at the LHC and the impact of PDFs on them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jan 2009 15:14:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Jan 2009 11:09:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-23"}

Assuming the vector space underlying a ternary algebra to be a\ntopological space and a triple product to be continuous mapping we consider the\ntrivial vector bundle over a ternary algebra and show that a triple product\ninduces a structure of binary algebra in each fiber of this vector bundle. We\nfind the sufficient and necessary condition for a ternary multiplication to\ninduce a structure of associative binary algebra in each fiber of this vector\nbundle. Given two modules over the algebras with involutions we construct a\nternary algebra which is used as a building block for a Lie algebra. We\nconstruct ternary algebras of cubic matrices and find four different totally\nassociative ternary multiplications of second kind of cubic matrices. It is\nproved that these are the only totally associative ternary multiplications of\nsecond kind in the case of cubic matrices. We describe a ternary analog of Lie\nalgebra of cubic matrices of second order which is based on a notion of\nj-commutator and find all commutation relations of generators of this algebra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jan 2009 15:25:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Jan 2009 09:31:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-22"}

In the\nastrophysics environment, neutrino-nucleon and neutrino-nucleus reaction rates\nare used as inputs in the simulations of phenomena like supernov$\\ae$\nexplosions and neutron star cooling. In the field of neutrino physics, the\nquantitative knowledge of neutrino-nucleus cross-section is critical to reduce\nthe systematic uncertainty of the long baseline oscillation experiments.\n  It is important to realize that, while neutrinos interacting in stellar\nmatter typically have energies of the order of few MeV, the energies involved\nin long baseline oscillations experiments are much larger. For example, K2K\nexperiment takes data in the region $E_{\\nu} =0.5-3$ GeV.\n  In this thesis, we describe how nuclear many-body theory provide a scheme\nallowing for a consistent treatment of neutrino-nucleus interactions at both\nhigh and low energies. We will show our predictions of the neutrino-nucleus\ncross section in the high energy regime and the results of our calculations for\nthe nuclear matter weak response in the low energy regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jan 2009 15:36:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-19"}

It was concluded that HIP 56948 most\nresembles the Sun in every respect including the Li abundance (though not\nperfectly similar) among the three and deserves the name of \"closest-ever solar\ntwin\", while HIP 79672 and HIP 100963 have somewhat higher effective\ntemperature and appreciably higher surface Li composition. While there is an\nindication of Li being rotation-dependent because the projected rotation in HIP\n56948 (and the Sun) is slightly lower than the other two, the rotational\ndifference alone does not seem to be so large as to efficiently produce the\nmarked change in Li. Rather, this may be more likely to be attributed (at least\npartly) to the slight difference in T_eff via some T_eff-sensitive\nLi-controlling mechanism. Since the abundance of beryllium was found to be\nessentially solar for all stars irrespective of Li, any physical process\ncausing the Li diversity should work only on Li without affecting Be.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jan 2009 15:48:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}
