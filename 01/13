The crossover events are not evenly distributed along the natural\nchromosomes. Monte Carlo simulations revealed that frequency of recombinations\ndecides about the strategy of chromosomes' and genomes' evolution. In large\npanmictic populations, under high recombination rate the Darwinian purifying\nselection operates keeping the fraction of defective genes at the relatively\nlow level. In small populations and under low recombination rate the strategy\nof complementing haplotypes seems to be more advantageous. Switching between\nthe two strategies has a character of phase transition - it depends on\ninbreeding coefficient and crossover rate. The critical recombination rate\ndepends also on the size of chromosome. It is also possible, that in one genome\nsome chromosomes could be under complementing while some other under purifying\nselection. Such situation stabilizes genome evolution and reproduction\nstrategy. It seems that this phenomenon can be responsible for the positive\ncorrelation between kinship and fecundity, recently found in the Islander\npopulation. When large population is forced to enter the complementing\nstrategy, the phenomenon of sympatric speciation is observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jan 2009 18:41:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-13"}

We also find that early-type and late-type galaxies\nexhibit distinct radial star formation rate (SFR) distributions, with\nearly-types having a SFR distribution that extends further relative to the\ngalaxy scale length, compared to late-types at all densities. We find that a\nsuppression of SF in the highest density environments is found in the highest\nstar forming galaxies for both galaxy types.

When the full\nsample is considered no clear suppression of SF is detected, indicating that\nthe environmental trends are driven only by the highest SF galaxies. We\ndemonstrate that the density-morphology relation alone cannot account for the\nsuppression of SF in the highest density environments.

However, vortex dynamics is commonly studied in\nnon-self-gravitating discs. The main goal here is to examine the effects of\ndisc self-gravity on vortex dynamics. For this purpose, we employ the 2D\nself-gravitating shearing sheet approximation. A simple cooling law with a\nconstant cooling time is adopted, such that the disc settles down into a\nquasi-steady gravitoturbulent state. In this state, vortices appear as\ntransient structures undergoing recurring phases of formation, growth to sizes\ncomparable to a local Jeans scale and eventual shearing and destruction due to\nthe combined effects of self-gravity and background Keplerian shear. Each phase\ntypically lasts about 2 orbital periods or less. As a result, in\nself-gravitating discs the overall dynamical picture of vortex evolution is\nirregular consisting of many transient vortices at different evolutionary\nstages and, therefore, with various sizes up to the local Jeans scale. Vortices\ngenerate density waves during evolution, which turn into shocks. Therefore, the\ndynamics of density waves and vortices are coupled implying that, in general,\none should consider both vortex and spiral density wave modes in order to get a\nproper understanding of self-gravitating disc dynamics. Our results suggest\nthat given such an irregular and rapidly varying character of vortex evolution\nin self-gravitating discs, it may be difficult for such vortices to effectively\ntrap dust particles. Further study of the behaviour of dust particles embedded\nin a self-gravitating gaseous disc is, however, required to strengthen this\nconclusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jan 2009 17:15:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Unfortunately, the\ncomplexity of the solar atmosphere, observational uncertainties, and the\nlimitations of current atomic calculations, particularly those for Fe, all\nconspire to make this task very difficult. A critical assessment of plasma\ndiagnostics in the corona is essential to making progress on the coronal\nheating problem. In this paper we present an analysis of temperature and\ndensity measurements above the limb in the quiet corona using new observations\nfrom the EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on \\textit{Hinode}. By comparing the Si\nand Fe emission observed with EIS we are able to identify emission lines that\nyield consistent emission measure distributions.

EIS density measurements from several density sensitive line\nratios are found to be generally consistent with each other and with previous\nmeasurements in the quiet corona.

A bulk piece of iron is a very complex material with\nmicrostructure, a split band structure, magnetic domains and crystallographic\ntextures that affect domain orientation. Probing iron and other bulk\nferromagnetic materials with weak reflected and transmitted inductive low\nfrequency fields is an easy operation to perform but the responses are\ndifficult to interpret because of the complexity and variety of the structures\naffected by the fields. First starting with a simple single coil induction\nmeasurement and classical EM calculation to show the error is grossly under\nestimating the measured response. Extending this experiment to measuring the\ntransmission of the induced fields allows the extraction of three dispersion\ncurves which define these internal fields. One dispersion curve yielded an\nexceedingly small effective mass of 1.8 10^{-39}kg (1.3 10^{-9} m_e) for those\nspin waves. There is a second distinct dispersion curve more representative of\nthe density function of a zero momentum bound state rather than a propagating\nwave. The third dispersion curve describes a magneto-elastic coupling to a very\nlong wave length propagating mode. These experiments taken together display the\ncharacteristics of a high temperature Bose-Einstein like condensation that can\nbe initiated by pumping two different states. A weak time dependent field\ndrives the formation of coupled J=0 spin wave pairs with the reduced effective\nmass reflecting the increased size of the coherent state.

The gas accumulation that\nensues triggers the Rossby wave instability, that in turn saturates into\nanticyclonic vortices. It was suggested that the trapping of solids within them\nleads to a burst of planet formation on very short timescales. We perform\ntwo-dimensional global simulations of the dynamics of gas and solids in a\nnon-magnetized thin protoplanetary disk with the Pencil Code.

Inside\nthe vortices, fast accumulation of solids occurs and the particles collapse\ninto objects of planetary mass in timescales as short as five orbits. Because\nthe drag force is size-dependent, aerodynamical sorting ensues within the\nvortical motion, and the first bound structures formed are composed primarily\nof similarly-sized particles.

All of the\nspacetime metrics associated with this family satisfy the equation of state\n$p=\\rho c^2/3$, correct for the pure radiation phase after inflation in the\nStandard Model of the Big Bang. By expanding solutions about the center to\nleading order in the Hubble length, the family reduces to a one-parameter\nfamily of expanding spacetimes that represent a perturbation of the Standard\nModel. We then derive a co-moving coordinate system in which the perturbed\nspacetimes can be compared with the Standard Model. In this coordinate system\nwe calculate the correction to the Hubble constant, as well as the exact\nleading order quadratic correction to the redshift vs luminosity relation for\nan observer at the center of the expanding FRW spacetime. The leading order\ncorrection to the redshift vs luminosity relation entails an adjustable free\nparameter that introduces an anomalous acceleration. We conclude that any\ncorrection to the redshift vs luminosity relation observed after the radiation\nphase of the Big Bang can be accounted for, at the leading order quadratic\nlevel, by adjustment of this free parameter.

No significant excess of events was observed at higher energies, but a\nsizable excess of events was observed at lower energies. The lack of the excess\nat higher energies allowed MiniBooNE to rule out simple two-neutrino\noscillations as an explanation of the LSND signal.

MiniBooNE observes an unexplained excess of $128.8 \\pm 20.4\n\\pm 38.3$ electron-like events in the energy region $200 < E_{\\nu} < 475$ MeV.\nThe NuMI data sample currently has a large systematic errors associated with\n$\\nu_{e}$ events, but shows an indication of an excess.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jan 2009 19:47:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2009 01:26:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-22"}

Both observations and simulations of galaxy formation\nsuggest that the energy input from active galactic nuclei (AGN), as the central\nsupermassive black hole accretes material and grows, heats the interstellar\nmaterial and suppresses star formation. In this Letter, we show that most host\ngalaxies of moderate-luminosity supermassive black holes in the local universe\nhave intermediate optical colors that imply the host galaxies are transitioning\nfrom star formation to quiescence, the first time this has been shown to be\ntrue for all AGN independent of obscuration. The intermediate colors suggest\nthat star formation in the host galaxies ceased roughly 100 Myr ago. This\nresult indicates that either the AGN are very long-lived, accreting for more\nthan 1 Gyr beyond the end of star formation, or there is a ~100 Myr time delay\nbetween the shutdown of star formation and detectable black hole growth. The\nfirst explanation is unlikely given current estimates for AGN lifetimes, so\nlow-lumiosity AGN must shut down star formation before substantial black hole\naccretion activity is detected. The scarcity of AGN host galaxies in the blue\ncloud reported here challenges scenarios where significant star formation and\nblack hole growth are coeval. Lastly, these observations also strongly support\nthe `Unified Model' of AGN as the host galaxy colors are independent of\nobscuration towards the central engine.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jan 2009 21:01:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 24 Jan 2009 17:20:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

We first use MIPS and literature\nphotometry to compile spectral energy distributions for each of the 12 members\nin MBM 12, and derive their IR excesses. The IRS spectra are analysed with the\nnewly developed two-layer temperature distribution (TLTD) spectral\ndecomposition method. For the 7 T Tauri stars with a detected IR excess, we\nanalyse their solid-state features to derive dust properties such as\nmass-averaged grain size, composition and crystallinity.

The fact that we see a radial dependence of the dust\nproperties indicates that radial mixing is not very efficient in the discs of\nthese young T Tauri stars.

However, with only radial\nvelocity data, it is impossible to determine if these planets are rocky or\ngaseous. Here we exploit various dynamical features of the system in order to\nassess the physical properties of the planets. Observations allow for circular\norbits, but a numerical integration shows that the eccentricities must be at\nleast 0.0001. Also, planets b and c are so close to the star that tidal effects\nare significant. If planet b has tidal parameters similar to the terrestrial\nplanets in the Solar System and a remnant eccentricity larger than 0.001, then,\ngoing back in time, the system would have been unstable within the lifetime of\nthe star (which we estimate to be 6.1 +/- 1.6 Gyr). Moreover, if the\neccentricities are that large and the inner planet is rocky, then its tidal\nheating may be an order of magnitude greater than extremely volcanic Io, on a\nper unit surface area basis. If planet b is not terrestrial, e.g. Neptune-like,\nthese physical constraints would not apply. This analysis suggests the planets\nare not terrestrial-like, and are more like our giant planets. In either case,\nwe find that the planets probably formed at larger radii and migrated early-on\n(via disk interactions) into their current orbits. This study demonstrates how\nthe orbital and dynamical properties of exoplanet systems may be used to\nconstrain the planets' physical properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jan 2009 01:23:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

This relates to the fact that closed exterior\nskew-symmetric differential forms are invariants.

In\norder to investigate the correlation between radio- and far-infrared emission,\nwe apply the leaky box approximation. Further, we derive photon- and neutrino\nspectra from proton-proton interactions in supernova remnants (SNRs). Here, we\nassume that a fraction of the SNR's energy is transferred to the acceleration\nof cosmic rays. We also investigate the possibility of detecting Gamma Ray\nBursts from nearby starburst galaxies, using the catalog defined here. We show\nthat the radio emission is only weakly dependent on the magnetic field. It\nturns out that the intensity of the radio signal is directly proportional to\nthe number of supernova explosions, which scales with the far-infrared\nluminosity.

However, there should be many more binaries with basically\ninvisible compact objects in non-interacting binaries. Here we report the\ndiscovery of unseen compact companions to hot subdwarfs in close binary\nsystems. Hot subdwarfs are evolved helium-core-burning stars that have lost\nmost of their hydrogen envelopes, often due to binary interactions. Using\nhigh-resolution spectra and assuming tidal synchronisation of the subdwarfs, we\nwere able to constrain the companion masses of 32 binaries. While most hot\nsubdwarf binaries have white-dwarf or late-type main sequence companions, as\npredicted by binary evolution models, at least 5% of the observed subdwarfs\nmust have very massive companions: unusually heavy white dwarfs, neutron stars\nand, in some cases, even black holes. We present evolutionary models which show\nthat such binaries can indeed form if the system has evolved through two\ncommon-envelope phases. This new connection between hot subdwarfs, which are\nnumerous in the Galaxy, and massive compact objects may lead to a tremendous\nincrease in the number of known neutron stars and black holes and shed some\nlight on this dark population and its evolutionary link to the X-ray binary\npopulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jan 2009 14:32:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-22"}

This procedure, with the Pontecorvo-Maki-nakagawa-Sakata modified\nelectroweak Lagrangian, calculates the cross-sections with the new neutrino\nenergy projection operators in the massive neutrino Fock space, resulting in\nthe Standard Model mass-less flavor neutrino cross-sections, plus the Lorentz\nnon-invariant neutrino oscillation cross-sections which are proportional to the\nsquares of neutrino masses and, as such, practically unobservable in the\nlaboratory. This scheme reinforces the notion that the mass-less flavor\nneutrino can be considered as the superposition of three massive neutrinos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jan 2009 15:31:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Jan 2009 15:58:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-26"}

This representation is obtained by transforming the RSOS paths,\nfor the cases p> 2p'-2, to new paths for which horizontal edges are allowed at\ncertain heights. These new paths are much simpler in that their weight is\nnothing but the sum of the position of the peaks. This description paves the\nway for the interpretation of the RSOS paths in terms of fermi-type charged\nparticles out of which the fermionic characters could be obtained\nconstructively. The derivation of the fermionic character for p'=2 and p=kp'+/-\n1 is outlined. Finally, the particles of the RSOS paths are put in relation\nwith the kinks and the breathers of the restricted sine-Gordon model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jan 2009 15:52:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2009 13:00:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-27"}
