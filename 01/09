It follows that air friction,\nnot only damps the oscillation, but also introduces randomness. In the\nso-called ``grand-mother'' clock, discovered by Huygens in the 18th century,\ndamping is compensated for, on the average, by an escapement mechanism driven\nby a falling weight. The purpose of this paper is to show that such a clock is,\nin its idealized form, a quiet oscillator. By ``quiet'' we mean that in spite\nof the randomness introduced by damping, the dissipated power (viewed as the\noscillator output) does not fluctuate slowly. Comparison is made with quiet\nlaser oscillators discovered theoretically in 1984. Because the input power\ndoes not fluctuate in both the mechanical oscillator and the quiet laser\noscillator, the output power does not fluctuate at small Fourier frequencies,\nirrespectively of the detailed mechanisms involved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jan 2009 19:51:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-09"}

In\naddition, feedback due to mechanical and thermal deposition of energy from jets\nand winds emitted by the accretion disk around the central SMBH is also\nexpected to occur. In this paper we improve and extend the accretion and\nfeedback physics explored in our previous papers to include also a physically\nmotivated mechanical feedback. We study the evolution of an isolated elliptical\ngalaxy with the aid of a high-resolution 1-D hydrodynamical code, where the\ncooling and heating functions include photoionization and Compton effects, and\nrestricting to models which include only radiative or only mechanical feedback.\nWe confirm that for Eddington ratios above 0.01 both the accretion and\nradiative output are forced by feedback effects to be in burst mode, so that\nstrong intermittencies are expected at early times, while at low redshift the\nexplored models are characterized by smooth, very sub-Eddington mass accretion\nrates punctuated by rare outbursts. However, the explored models always fail\nsome observational tests. If we assume the high mechanical efficiency of\n10^{-2.3}, we find that most of the gas is ejected from the galaxy, the\nresulting X-ray luminosity is far less than is typically observed and little\nSMBH growth occurs. But models with low enough mechanical efficiency to\naccomodate satisfactory SMBH growth tend to allow too strong cooling flows and\nleave galaxies at z=0 with E+A spectra more frequently than is observed.

In this scheme the factorized amplitude admits a\npowerful symmetry: it is invariant under rescaling of individual Wilson-line\nvelocities. This symmetry is broken by cusp singularities in both the soft and\nthe eikonal jet functions. We show that the cancellation of these cusp\nanomalies in any multi-leg amplitude imposes all-order constraints on the\nkinematic dependence of the corresponding soft anomalous dimension, relating it\nto the cusp anomalous dimension. For amplitudes with two or three hard partons\nthe solution is unique: the constraints fully determine the kinematic\ndependence of the soft function.

Results: Around\nZeta Oph, 12CO emission appears in two distinct intervals of reddening centered\nnear EBV = 0.4 and 0.65 mag, of which < 0.2 mag is background material. Within\neither interval, the integrated 12CO intensity varies up to 6-12 K-km/s\ncompared to 1.5 K-km/s toward Zeta Oph. Nearly 80% of the individual profiles\nhave velocity dispersions < 0.6 km/s, which are subsonic at the kinetic\ntemperature derived from H2 toward Zeta Oph, 55 K. Partly as a result, 12CO\nemission exposes the internal, turbulent, supersonic (1-3 km/s) gas flows with\nespecial clarity in the cores of strong lines. The flows are manifested as\nresolved velocity gradients in narrow, subsonically-broadened line cores.\nConclusions: The scatter between N(CO) and EBV in global, CO absorption line\nsurveys toward bright stars is present in the gas seen around Zeta Oph,\nreflecting the extreme sensitivity of N(12CO) to ambient conditions. The\ntwo-component nature of the optical absorption toward Zeta Oph is coincidental\nand the star is occulted by a single body of gas with a complex internal\nstructure, not by two distinct clouds. The very bright 12CO lines in diffuse\ngas arise at N(H2) ~ 10^21/cm^2 in regions of modest density n(H) ~ 200-500/cc\nand somewhat more complete C+-CO conversion. Given the variety of structure in\nthe foreground gas, it is apparent that only large surveys of absorption\nsightlines can hope to capture the intrinsic behavior of diffuse gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jan 2009 19:22:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Aims: To acquire mm-wave J=1-0 CO\nemission line profiles toward a substantial sample of commonly-studied\noptical/uv absorption line targets and to compare with the properties of the\nabsorbing gas, especially the predicted emission line strengths. Methods: Using\nthe ARO 12m telescope we observed mm-wavelength J=1-0 CO emission with spectral\nresolution R ~ 3x10^6 and spatial resolution 1' toward a sample of 110 lines of\nsight previously studied in optical/uv absorption lines of CO, \\HH, CH, etc.\nResults: Interstellar CO emission was detected along 65 of the 110 lines of\nsight surveyed and there is a general superabundance of CO emission given the\ndistribution of galactic latitudes in the survey sample. Much of the emission\nis optically thick or very intense and must emanate from dark clouds or warm\ndense gas near HII regions. Conclusions: Judging from the statistical\nsuperabundance of CO emission, seen also in the total line of sight reddening,\nthe OB star optical/uv absorption line targets must be physically associated\nwith the large quantities of neutral gas whose CO emission was detected, in\nwhich case they are probably influencing the absorbing gas by heating and/or\nphotoionizing it. This explains why CO/H2 and 12CO/13CO ratios differ somewhat\nbetween $uv$ and mm-wave absorption line studies. Because the lines of sight\nhave been preselected to have AV < 1 mag, relatively little of the associated\nmaterial actually occults the targets, making it difficult for CO emission line\nobservations to isolate the foreground gas contribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jan 2009 19:57:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

This behavior is sometimes termed \"anti-hierarchical\", and\ncontrasted with the \"bottom-up\" assembly of the dark matter structures in Cold\nDark Matter models. In this paper we address three different kinds of\nobservational evidence that have been described as DS: the stellar mass\nassembly, star formation rate and the ages of the stellar populations in local\ngalaxies. We compare a broad compilation of available data-sets with the\npredictions of three different semi-analytic models of galaxy formation within\nthe Lambda-CDM framework. In the data, we see only weak evidence at best of DS\nin stellar mass and in star formation rate. We find that, when observational\nerrors on stellar mass and SFR are taken into account, the models acceptably\nreproduce the evolution of massive galaxies, over the entire redshift range\nthat we consider. However, lower mass galaxies are formed too early in the\nmodels and are too passive at late times. Thus, the models do not correctly\nreproduce the DS trend in stellar mass or the archaeological DS, while they\nqualitatively reproduce the mass-dependent evolution of the SFR. We demonstrate\nthat these discrepancies are not solely due to a poor treatment of satellite\ngalaxies but are mainly connected to the excessively efficient formation of\ncentral galaxies in high-redshift haloes with circular velocities ~100-200\nkm/s.

Using\nfirst-principles calculations, we attribute the different measured conductance\nstates to distinct contact geometries at the flexible but stable N-Au bond:\nconductance is low when the N-Au bond is perpendicular to the conducting\npi-system, and high otherwise. This switching mechanism, inherent to the\npyridine-gold link, could form the basis of a new class of\nmechanically-activated single-molecule switches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jan 2009 21:22:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Cosmic rays are the dominant\nionization mechanism in this environment, so the large ionization rate implies\na high cosmic-ray flux, and a large amount of energy residing in cosmic rays.\nIn this paper we find that the standard propagated cosmic-ray spectrum predicts\nan ionization rate much lower than that inferred from H_3^+. Low-energy (~10\nMeV) cosmic rays are the most efficient at ionizing hydrogen, but cannot be\ndirectly detected; consequently, an otherwise unobservable enhancement of the\nlow-energy cosmic-ray flux offers a plausible explanation for the H_3^+\nresults. Beyond ionization, cosmic rays also interact with the interstellar\nmedium by spalling atomic nuclei and exciting atomic nuclear states. These\nprocesses produce the light elements Li, Be, and B, as well as gamma-ray lines.\nTo test the consequences of an enhanced low-energy cosmic-ray flux, we adopt\ntwo physically-motivated cosmic-ray spectra which by construction reproduce the\nionization rate inferred in diffuse clouds, and investigate the implications of\nthese spectra on dense cloud ionization rates, light element abundances,\ngamma-ray fluxes, and energetics. One spectrum proposed here provides an\nexplanation for the high ionization rate seen in diffuse clouds while still\nappearing to be broadly consistent with other observables, but the shape of\nthis spectrum suggests that supernovae remnants may not be the predominant\naccelerators of low-energy cosmic rays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jan 2009 22:01:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

The method is based on the use of the Stationary\nFokker--Planck (SFP) approach to sample from the posterior density. Stationary\nFokker--Planck sampling generalizes the Gibbs sampler algorithm for arbitrary\nand unknown conditional densities. By the SFP procedure approximate analytical\nexpressions for the conditionals and marginals of the posterior can be\nconstructed. At each stage of SFP, the approximate conditionals are used to\ndefine a Gibbs sampling process, which is convergent to the full joint\nposterior. By the analytical marginals efficient learning methods in the\ncontext of Artificial Neural Networks are outlined. Off--line and incremental\nBayesian inference and Maximum Likelihood Estimation from the posterior is\nperformed in classification and regression examples. A comparison of SFP with\nother Monte Carlo strategies in the general problem of sampling from arbitrary\ndensities is also presented. It is shown that SFP is able to jump large\nlow--probabilty regions without the need of a careful tuning of any step size\nparameter.

We\nestablish and thoroughly test a GALFIT-based pipeline to fit 2D Sersic models\nto SDSS data. We find that the fitting results are most sensitive to the\nbackground sky level determination and strongly recommend using the SDSS global\nvalue. We find that uncertainties in the background translate into a strong\ncovariance between the total magnitude, half-light size (r50), and Sersic index\n(n), especially for bright/massive galaxies. We find that n depends strongly on\nMstar for CENs, but only weakly or not at all on Mhalo. Less (more) massive\nCENs tend to be disk (spheroid)-like over the full Mhalo range. Likewise, there\nis a clear r50-Mstar relation for CENs, with separate slopes for disks and\nspheroids. When comparing CENs with satellite galaxies (SATs), we find that low\nmass (<10e10.75 Msun/h^2) SATs have larger median n than CENs of similar Mstar.\nLow mass, late-type SATs have moderately smaller r50 than late-type CENs of the\nsame Mstar. However, we find no size differences between spheroid-like CENs and\nSATs, and no structural differences between CENs and SATs matched in both mass\nand colour. The similarity of massive SATs and CENs shows that this distinction\nhas no significant impact on the structure of spheroids. We conclude that Mstar\nis the most fundamental property determining the basic structure of a galaxy.\nThe lack of a clear n-Mhalo relation rules out a distinct group mass for\nproducing spheroids, and the responsible morphological transformation processes\nmust occur at the centres of groups spanning a wide range of masses.

Perimeter tracing minimizes line-of-sight obscurations\ncaused by the emitting plasma of the various wavelengths by taking measurements\nat the solar limb. Perimeter tracing also allows for the polar rotation period\nto emerge organically from the data as 33 days. We have called this the Harvey\nrotation rate and count Harvey rotations starting 4 January 1900. From the\nmeasured perimeter, we are then able to fit a curve to the data and derive an\narea within the line of best fit. We observe the area of the northern polar\nhole area in 1996, at the beginning of solar cycle 23, to be about 4.2% of the\ntotal solar surface area and about 3.6% in 2007. The area of the southern polar\nhole is observed to be about 4.0% in 1996 and about 3.4% in 2007. Thus, both\nthe north and south polar hole areas are no more than 15% smaller now than they\nwere at the beginning of cycle 23. This compares to the polar magnetic field\nmeasured to be about 40% less now than it was a cycle ago.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jan 2009 00:38:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

These codes are obtained\nas a result of folding the set of rational places of a function field using\ncertain elements (automorphisms) from the Galois group of the extension. This\nwork is an extension of Folded Reed Solomon codes to the setting of Algebraic\nGeometric codes. We describe two constructions based on this framework\ndepending on if the order of the automorphism used to fold the code is large or\nsmall compared to the block length. When the automorphism is of large order,\nthe codes have polynomially bounded list size in the worst case. This\nconstruction gives codes of rate $R$ over an alphabet of size independent of\nblock length that can correct a fraction of $1-R-\\epsilon$ errors subject to\nthe existence of asymptotically good towers of function fields with large\nautomorphisms. The second construction addresses the case when the order of the\nelement used to fold is small compared to the block length. In this case a\nheuristic analysis shows that for a random received word, the expected list\nsize and the running time of the decoding algorithm are bounded by a polynomial\nin the block length. When applied to the Garcia-Stichtenoth tower, this yields\ncodes of rate $R$ over an alphabet of size\n$(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2})^{O(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon})}$, that can correct a fraction\nof $1-R-\\epsilon$ errors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jan 2009 02:46:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-12"}

On the conductance plateau, the low-temperature\ncorrections are solely due to momentum-nonconserving processes that change the\nrelative number of left- and right-moving electrons. This leads to a\nsuppression of the conductance for increasing temperature or voltage. The size\nof the suppression is estimated for a realistic saddle-point potential, and is\nlargest in the beginning of the conductance plateau. For large magnetic field,\ninteraction effects are strongly suppressed by the Pauli principle, and hence\nthe first spin-split conductance plateau has a much weaker interaction\ncorrection.

The\nforce balance in the Earth's core is very unlike classical astrophysical\napplications of the MRI (such as gaseous disks around stars). Here, the weak\ndifferential rotation in the Earth core yields an instability by its\nconstructive interaction with the planet's much larger rotation rate. The\nresulting destabilising mechanism is just strong enough to counteract\nstabilizing resistive effects, and produce growth on geophysically interesting\ntimescales.

It has been suggested\nthat this thermal/viscous instability can account for the long term variability\nof AGNs. We test this assertion by presenting a systematic study of the\napplication of the disk instability model (DIM) to AGNs. We are using the\nadaptative grid numerical code we have developed in the context of CVs,\nenabling us to fully resolve the radial structure of the disk. We show that,\nbecause in AGN disks the Mach numbers are very large, the heating and cooling\nfronts are so narrow that they cannot be resolved by the numerical codes that\nhave been used until now. In addition, these fronts propagate on time scales\nmuch shorter than the viscous time. As a result, a sequence of heating and\ncooling fronts propagate back and forth in the disk, leading only to small\nvariations of the accretion rate onto the black hole, with short quiescent\nstates occurring for very low mass transfer rates only. Truncation of the inner\npart of the disk by e.g. an ADAF does not alter this result, but enables longer\nquiescent states. Finally we discuss the effects of irradiation by the central\nX-ray source, and show that, even for extremely high irradiation efficiencies,\noutbursts are not a natural outcome of the model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jan 2009 12:00:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The resolved\nstellar content thus provides a basis for studying the star formation history\ninto recent times and constraining several stellar population properties, such\nas the present day mass function, the initial mass function and the binary\nfraction. To better characterize the pre-main sequence population, we present a\nnew set of model stellar evolutionary tracks for this evolutionary phase with\nmetallicity appropriate for the Small Magellanic Cloud (Z = 0.004). We use a\nstellar population synthesis code, which takes into account a full range of\nstellar evolution phases to derive our best estimate for the star formation\nhistory in the region by comparing observed and synthetic color-magnitude\ndiagrams.

This has been proposed many times in the past, and simple, single\nradius models can qualitatively match the observed increase in QPO frequency by\ndecreasing a characteristic radius, as predicted by the truncated disc models.\nHowever, this also predicts that the frequency is strongly dependent on spin,\nand gives a maximum frequency at the last stable orbit which is generally much\nhigher than the remarkably constant maximum frequency at ~10Hz observed in all\nblack hole binaries. The key aspect of our model which makes it match these\nobservations is that the precession is of a radially extended region of the hot\ninner flow. The outer radius is set by the truncation radius of the disc as\nabove, but the inner radius lies well outside of the last stable orbit at the\npoint where numerical simulations show that the density drops off sharply for a\nmisaligned flow. Physically motivated analytic estimates for this inner radius\nshow that it increases with a_*, decreasing the expected frequency in a way\nwhich almost completely cancels the expected increase with spin. This ties the\nmaximum predicted frequency to around 10Hz irrespective of a_*, as observed.\nThis is the first QPO model which explains both frequencies and spectrum in the\ncontext of a well established geometry for the accretion flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jan 2009 15:47:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Jan 2009 18:11:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 24 Feb 2009 12:10:57 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 26 May 2009 13:22:45 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 6 Mar 2014 10:27:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-15"}

The density variation length scale is\nchosen to be four times smaller than the velocity variation length scale so\nthat Holmboe or Kelvin-Helmholtz unstable modes are present depending on the\nchoice of the global Richardson number Ri. Three different values of Ri were\nexamined Ri =0.2, 2, 20. The flows for the three examined values are all\nunstable due to different modes namely: the Kelvin-Helmholtz mode for Ri=0.2,\nthe first Holmboe mode for Ri=2, and the second Holmboe mode for Ri=20 that has\nbeen discovered recently and it is the first time that it is examined in the\nnon-linear stage. It is found that the amplitude of the velocity perturbation\nof the second Holmboe mode at the non-linear stage is smaller but comparable to\nfirst Holmboe mode. The increase of the potential energy however due to the\nsecond Holmboe modes is greater than that of the first mode. The\nKelvin-Helmholtz mode is larger by two orders of magnitude in kinetic energy\nthan the Holmboe modes and about ten times larger in potential energy than the\nHolmboe modes. The results in this paper suggest that although mixing is\nsuppressed at large Richardson numbers it is not negligible, and turbulent\nmixing processes in strongly stratified environments can not be excluded.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jan 2009 15:33:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Water absorbs microwave\npower more efficiently than polymers, glass, and oils due to its permanent\nmolecular dipole moment that has a large dielectric loss at GHz frequencies.\nThe relevant heat capacity of the system is a single thermally isolated\npicoliter drop of water and this enables very fast thermal cycling. We\ndemonstrate microwave dielectric heating in a microfluidic device that\nintegrates a flow-focusing drop maker, drop splitters, and metal electrodes to\nlocally deliver microwave power from an inexpensive, commercially available 3.0\nGHz source and amplifier. The temperature of the drops is measured by observing\nthe temperature dependent fluorescence intensity of cadmium selenide\nnanocrystals suspended in the water drops. We demonstrate characteristic\nheating times as short as 15 ms to steady-state temperatures as large as 30\ndegrees C above the base temperature of the microfluidic device. Many common\nbiological and chemical applications require rapid and local control of\ntemperature, such as PCR amplification of DNA, and can benefit from this new\ntechnique.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jan 2009 15:30:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-12"}

They are often considered to be the more massive counter\nparts of Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars. While the AGB mass loss is linked\nto their strong pulsations, the RSG are often only weakly variable. Aim: To\nstudy the conditions at the base of the wind, by determining the dust\ncomposition in a sample of RSG. The dust composition is thought to be sensitive\nto the density, temperature and acceleration at the base of the wind. Method:\nWe compile a sample of 27 RSG infrared spectra (ISO-SWS) and supplement these\nwith photometric measurements to obtain the full spectral energy distribution\n(SED). These data are modelled using a dust radiative transfer code. The\nresults are scrutinised for correlations. Results: We find (1) strong\ncorrelations between dust composition, mass-loss rate and stellar luminosity,\nroughly in agreement with the theoretical dust condensation sequence, (2) the\nneed for a continuous (near-)IR dust opacity and tentatively propose amorphous\ncarbon, and (3) significant differences with AGB star winds: presence of PAHs,\nabsence of 'the' 13 micron band, and a lack of strong water bands. Conclusions:\nDust condensation in RSG is found to experience a similar freeze-out process as\nin AGB stars. Together with the positive effect of the stellar luminosity on\nthe mass-loss rate, this suggests that radiation pressure on dust grains is an\nimportant ingredient in the driving mechanism. Still, differences with AGB\nstars are manifold and thus the winds of RSG deserve separate studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jan 2009 15:35:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The densest parts of the Galactic spiral arms\nhave been monitored to maximize the microlensing signal expected from the stars\nof the Galactic disk and bulge. 12.9 million stars have been monitored during 7\nseasons towards 4 directions in the Galactic plane, away from the Galactic\ncenter. A total of 27 microlensing event candidates have been found. Estimates\nof the optical depths from the 22 best events are provided. A first order\ninterpretation shows that simple Galactic models with a standard disk and an\nelongated bulge are in agreement with our observations. We find that the\naverage microlensing optical depth towards the complete EROS-cataloged stars of\nthe spiral arms is $\\bar{\\tau} =0.51\\pm .13\\times 10^{-6}$, a number that is\nstable when the selection criteria are moderately varied. As the EROS catalog\nis almost complete up to $I_C=18.5$, the optical depth estimated for the\nsub-sample of bright target stars with $I_C<18.5$ ($\\bar{\\tau}=0.39\\pm\n>.11\\times 10^{-6}$) is easier to interpret. The set of microlensing events\nthat we have observed is consistent with a simple Galactic model. A more\nprecise interpretation would require either a better knowledge of the distance\ndistribution of the target stars, or a simulation based on a Galactic model.\nFor this purpose, we define and discuss the concept of optical depth for a\ngiven catalog or for a limiting magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jan 2009 12:59:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}
