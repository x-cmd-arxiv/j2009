It amounts to transform a classical fluid into a quantum-type fluid\nby the application of a quantum-like potential, either directly in a stationary\nconfiguration, or through a retro-active loop to simulate the time evolution.\nIn this framework, the amplitude of the quantum potential depends on a\nmacroscopic generalization of the Planck constant, which can be changed during\nthe experiment, therefore simulating a quantum to classical transition. The\nexperiment is exemplified here by an application of this concept to gravity\nwaves at the surface of an incompressible liquid in a basin of finite height,\nwith particular emphasis on the quantized vortex. We construct a complex wave\nfunction with the height of the fluid in the basin as its square modulus and\nthe velocity potential as its phase. This wave function is solution of a\nnonlinear Schrodinger equation typical of superfluids. The quantum potential is\ntherefore defined here in terms of the square root of the fluid height. We\nsuggest two methods for applying this quantum-like potential to the fluid: (i)\nby the action of a force on the surface (wind, blower, pressure, field,\netc...); (ii) by a curvature of the basin ground. In this last case the ground\nprofile yields the quantum potential itself, while usually only the quantum\nforce is accessible, so that such an experiment is expected to provide one with\na macroscopic model of a quantum-type vacuum energy.

A two-dimensional, semi-analytical model is\npresented that follows, for the first time, the chemical evolution from a\ncollapsing molecular cloud (a pre-stellar core) to a protostar and\ncircumstellar disk. The model computes infall trajectories from any point in\nthe cloud and tracks the radial and vertical motion of material in the\nviscously evolving disk. It includes a full time-dependent radiative transfer\ntreatment of the dust temperature, which controls much of the chemistry. A\nsmall parameter grid is explored to understand the effects of the sound speed\nand the mass and rotation of the cloud. The freeze-out and evaporation of\ncarbon monoxide (CO) and water (H2O), as well as the potential for forming\ncomplex organic molecules in ices, are considered as important first steps to\nillustrate the full chemistry.\n  Results. Both species freeze out towards the centre before the collapse\nbegins. Pure CO ice evaporates during the infall phase and re-adsorbs in those\nparts of the disk that cool below the CO desorption temperature of ~18 K. H2O\nremains solid almost everywhere during the infall and disk formation phases and\nevaporates within ~10 AU of the star. Mixed CO-H2O ices are important in\nkeeping some solid CO above 18 K and in explaining the presence of CO in\ncomets. Material that ends up in the planet- and comet-forming zones of the\ndisk is predicted to spend enough time in a warm zone during the collapse to\nform first-generation complex organic species on the grains. The dynamical\ntimescales in the hot inner envelope (hot core or hot corino) are too short for\nabundant formation of second-generation molecules by high-temperature gas-phase\nchemistry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jan 2009 20:46:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We consider two forms of genome organization.

If the organism\nhas $ l $ homologous pairs that lack a functional copy of the given gene, then\nthe fitness of the organism is $ \\kappa_l $. The $ \\kappa_l $ are assumed to be\nmonotonically decreasing, so that $ \\kappa_0 = 1 > \\kappa_1 > \\kappa_2 > ... >\n\\kappa_{\\infty} = 0 $.

Assuming a\nmultiplicative fitness landscape where $ \\kappa_l = \\alpha^{l} $ for $ \\alpha\n\\in (0, 1) $, this strategy is found to have a mean fitness that exceeds the\nmean fitness of all of the other strategies.

However, this theorem applies only to\nstrictly simple configurations, where bars intersect only at their common\nendpoints. We generalize the theorem to self-touching configurations, where\nbars can touch but not properly cross. At the heart of our proof is a new\ndefinition of self-touching configurations of planar linkages, based on an\nannotated configuration space and limits of nontouching configurations. We show\nthat this definition is equivalent to the previously proposed definition of\nself-touching configurations, which is based on a combinatorial description of\noverlapping features.

The\nX-ray spectrum of the emission around the outer southwestern edge of the lobe\nis well described by a single power-law model with Galactic absorption --\nthermal models are strongly disfavoured, except in the region closest to the\nnucleus. We conclude that a significant fraction of the X-ray emission around\nthe southwest part of the lobe is synchrotron, not thermal. We infer that in\nthe region where the shock is strongest and the ambient gas density lowest, the\ninflation of the lobe is accelerating particles to X-ray synchrotron emitting\nenergies, similar to supernova remnants such as SN1006. This interpretation\nresolves a problem of our earlier, purely thermal, interpretation for this\nemission, namely that the density compression across the shock was required to\nbe much larger than the theoretically expected factor of 4. We estimate that\nthe lobe is expanding to the southwest with a velocity of ~2600 km/s, roughly\nMach 8 relative to the ambient medium. We discuss the spatial variation of\nspectral index across the shock region, concluding that our observations\nconstrain gamma_max for the accelerated particles to be 10^8 at the strongest\npart of the shock, consistent with expectations from diffusive shock\nacceleration theory. Finally, we consider the implications of these results for\nthe production of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) and TeV emission from\nCentaurus A, concluding that the shock front region is unlikely to be a\nsignificant source of UHECRs, but that TeV emission from this region is\nexpected at levels comparable to current limits at TeV energies, for plausible\nassumed magnetic field strengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Jan 2009 02:00:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Current\ndistributions and a current dependence of the total energy are determined for\nboth states. With no injected current, the energy of the ACDW state is lower\nthan that of the striped Hall state. We find that the energy of the ACDW state\nincreases faster than that of the striped Hall state as the injected current\nincreases. Hence, the striped Hall state becomes the lower energy state when\nthe current exceeds the critical value. The critical value is estimated at\nabout 0.04 - 0.05 nA which is much smaller than the current used in the\nexperiments.

We show in this\npaper that the asymptotic variance of this type of adaptive MCMC is always at\nleast as large as the asymptotic variance of the Markov chain with transition\nkernel $P$. We also show by simulation that the difference can be substantial.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Jan 2009 14:16:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2009 01:00:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 15 Oct 2010 07:07:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-18"}

We\npropose a conceptual framework that aims to capture interdisciplinarity in the\nwider sense of knowledge integration, by exploring the concepts of diversity\nand coherence. Disciplinary diversity indicators are developed to describe the\nheterogeneity of a bibliometric set viewed from predefined categories, i.e.\nusing a top-down approach that locates the set on the global map of science.\nNetwork coherence indicators are constructed to measure the intensity of\nsimilarity relations within a bibliometric set, i.e. using a bottom-up\napproach, which reveals the structural consistency of the publications network.\nWe carry out case studies on individual articles in bionanoscience to\nillustrate how these two perspectives identify different aspects of\ninterdisciplinarity: disciplinary diversity indicates the large-scale breadth\nof the knowledge base of a publication; network coherence reflects the novelty\nof its knowledge integration. We suggest that the combination of these two\napproaches may be useful for comparative studies of emergent scientific and\ntechnological fields, where new and controversial categorisations are\naccompanied by equally contested claims of novelty and interdisciplinarity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Jan 2009 15:28:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-13"}
