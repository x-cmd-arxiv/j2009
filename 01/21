The\noptimal fraction of of power allocated to training is identified. Spectral\nefficiency--bit energy tradeoff is analyzed in the low-power and wideband\nregimes by employing the effective capacity formulation. In particular, it is\nshown that the bit energy increases without bound in the low-power regime as\nthe average power vanishes. On the other hand, it is proven that the bit energy\ndiminishes to its minimum value in the wideband regime as the available\nbandwidth increases. For this case, expressions for the minimum bit energy and\nwideband slope are derived.

In this unique case,\nthe planet-planet interactions are of such significance that the radial\nvelocity data set is more sensitive to the inclination of the system through\nthe dependence of the interactions on the true masses of the two gas giant\nplanets in the system (planets b and c). The astrometry does allow\ndetermination of the absolute orbital inclination (i.e. distinguishing between\ni and 180-i) and longitude of the ascending node for planet b, which allows us\nto quantify the mutual inclination angle between its orbit and planet c's orbit\nwhen combined with the dynamical considerations. We find that the planets have\na mutual inclination of 5.0 +3.9 -2.3 degrees. This result constitutes the\nfirst determination of the degree of coplanarity in an exoplanetary system\naround a normal star. That we find the two planets' orbits are nearly coplanar,\nlike the orbits of the Solar System planets, indicates that the planets likely\nformed in a circumstellar disk, and that their subsequent dynamical evolution\ninto a 2:1 mean motion resonance only led to excitation of a small mutual\ninclination.

The\nstar formation efficiency is large and increases monotonically to low masses,\nin disagreement with data. With outflows, the baryon fraction is increasingly\nsuppressed in halos to lower masses. A Milky Way-sized halo at z=0 has about\n60% of the cosmic fraction of baryons, so \"missing\" halo baryons have largely\nbeen evacuated, rather than existing in some hidden form. Large halos (>10^13\nMo) contain 85% of their cosmic share of baryons, which explains the mild\nmissing baryon problem seen in clusters.

To this aim, the\nluminosity (or isotropic emitted energy) of a GRB at redshift z must be\nevaluated from a correlation with a distance independent quantity so that one\ncan then solve for the luminosity distance D_L(z) and hence the distance\nmodulus mu(z). Averaging over five different two parameters correlations and\nusing a fiducial cosmological model to calibrate them, Schaefer (2007) has\ncompiled a sample of 69 GRBs with measured mu(z) which has since then been\nwidely used to constrain cosmological parameters. We update here that sample by\nmany aspects. First, we add a recently found correlation for the X - ray\nafterglow and use a Bayesian inspired fitting method to calibrate the different\nGRBs correlations known insofar assuming a fiducial LCDM model in agreement\nwith the recent WMAP5 data. Averaging over six correlations, we end with a new\nGRBs Hubble diagram comprising 83 objects.

This\nreveals a transformation from the semiconducting to the conducting material,\nand it becomes much more clearly visible from our presented current-voltage\ncharacteristics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jan 2009 11:19:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-26"}

Increasing the driving\nforce, a stationary cellular pattern becomes unstable towards a mixed pattern\nof irregular clusters which consist of time-dependent localized patterns of\nvariable spatiotemporal coherence. These irregular clusters coexist with the\nbasic cellular pattern. The Fourier spectra corresponding to this\nsynchronization transition reveals the weak coupling of a resonant triad. This\npattern saturates with the formation of a unique domain of great spatiotemporal\ncoherence. As we further increase the driving force, a supercritical\nbifurcation to a spatiotemporal beating regime takes place. The new pattern is\ncharacterized by the presence of two stationary clusters with a characteristic\nzig-zag geometry. The Fourier analysis reveals a stronger coupling and enables\nto find out that this beating phenomena is produced by the splitting of the\nfundamental spatiotemporal frequencies in a narrow band. Both secondary\ninstabilities are phase-like synchronization transitions with global and\nabsolute character. Far beyond this threshold, a new instability takes place\nwhen the system is not able to sustain the spatial frequency splitting,\nalthough the temporal beating remains inside these domains. These experimental\nresults may support the understanding of other systems in nature undergoing\nsimilar clustering processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jan 2009 11:31:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-10"}

A\nfundamental issue in such networks is dealing with disruptions of end-to-end\npaths. Under a stochastic model, we compare the performance of the established\nend-to-end retransmission (ignoring partial paths), against a forwarding\nmechanism that leverages partial paths to forward data closer to the\ndestination even during disruption periods. Perhaps surprisingly, the\nalternative mechanism is not necessarily superior. However, under a stochastic\nmonotonicity condition between current v.s. future path length, which we\ndemonstrate to hold in typical network models, we manage to prove superiority\nof the alternative mechanism in stochastic dominance terms.

The simulations use the evolution and initial-data codes of Shibata\nand Uryu to compute the last several orbits and the merger of neutron stars,\nwith matter described by a parametrized equation of state. Previous work\nsuggested the use of an effective cutoff frequency to place constraints on the\nequation of state. We find, however, that greater accuracy is obtained by\nmeasuring departures from the point-particle limit of the gravitational\nwaveform produced during the late inspiral.\n  As the stars approach their final plunge and merger, the gravitational wave\nphase accumulates more rapidly for smaller values of the neutron star\ncompactness (the ratio of the mass of the neutron star to its radius). We\nestimate that realistic equations of state will lead to gravitational waveforms\nthat are distinguishable from point particle inspirals at an effective distance\n(the distance to an optimally oriented and located system that would produce an\nequivalent waveform amplitude) of 100 Mpc or less. As Lattimer and Prakash\nobserved, neutron-star radius is closely tied to the pressure at density not\nfar above nuclear. Our results suggest that broadband gravitational wave\nobservations at frequencies between 500 and 1000 Hz will constrain this\npressure, and we estimate the accuracy with which it can be measured. Related\nfirst estimates of radius measurability show that the radius can be determined\nto an accuracy of ~1 km at 100 Mpc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jan 2009 14:56:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-14"}

We also consider\ntwo ways of formulating the classical vector potential which describes a\nuniform electric field in combination with the other possibilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jan 2009 15:46:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-21"}

The resulting network is a\nversion of the so-called minimal directed spanning tree. We give laws of large\nnumbers and convergence in distribution results on the large-sample asymptotic\nbehaviour of the total power-weighted edge-length of the network on uniform\nrandom points in $(0,1)^d$. The distributional results exhibit a\nweight-dependent phase transition between Gaussian and boundary-effect-derived\ndistributions. These boundary contributions are characterized in terms of\nlimits of the so-called on-line nearest-neighbour graph, a natural model of\nspatial network evolution, for which we also present some new results. Also, we\ngive a convergence in distribution result for the length of the longest edge in\nthe drainage network; when $d=2$, the limit is expressed in terms of\nDickman-type variables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jan 2009 15:53:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-01"}
