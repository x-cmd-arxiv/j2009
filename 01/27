The motivation is extended topological quantum field theory (TQFT),\nwhere the 2-category of unitary 2-representations of a finite group is thought\nof as the `2-category assigned to the point' in the untwisted finite group\nmodel.\n  The first result is that the braided monoidal category of transformations of\nthe identity on the 2-category of unitary 2-representations of a finite group\ncomputes as the category of conjugation equivariant vector bundles over the\ngroup equipped with the fusion tensor product. This result is consistent with\nthe extended TQFT hypotheses of Baez and Dolan, since it establishes that the\ncategory assigned to the circle can be obtained as the `higher trace of the\nidentity' of the 2-category assigned to the point.\n  The second result is about 2-characters of 2-representations, a concept which\nhas been introduced independently by Ganter and Kapranov. It is shown that the\n2-character of a unitary 2-representation can be made functorial with respect\nto morphisms of 2-representations, and that in fact the 2-character is a\nunitarily fully faithful functor from the complexified Grothendieck category of\nunitary 2-representations to the category of unitary equivariant vector bundles\nover the group.\n  The final result is about pivotal structures on fusion categories, with a\nview towards a conjecture made by Etingof, Nikshych and Ostrik. It is shown\nthat a pivotal structure on a fusion category cannot exist unless certain\ninvolutions on the hom-sets are plus or minus the identity map, in which case a\npivotal structure is the same thing as a twisted monoidal natural\ntransformation of the identity functor on the category. Moreover the pivotal\nstructure can be made spherical if and only if these signs can be removed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jan 2009 16:35:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-27"}

We fully treat the\ndynamics of the gluonic zero modes and check how this affects results from\nprevious studies of the B=0 and B=1 systems. For a finite density of baryons,\nand for any m>0, we find that the ground state contains a baryon crystal with\nexpectation values for psi-bar gamma_mu psi that have a helix-like spatial\nstructure. We study how these evolve with B and see that the volume integral of\npsi-bar psi strongly changes with the baryon density. We compare this emerging\ncrystal structure with the sine-Gordon crystal, which is expected to be a good\napproximation for light quarks, and find that it is a very good approximation\nfor surprisingly heavy quarks. We also calculate the way the ground state\nenergy E changes as a function of the baryon number B, and find that for\nsufficiently large densities the function E(B) is well described by the\nequation of state for free massless quarks, thus suggesting a quark-Hadron\ncontinuity. From dE(B)/dB we calculate the quark chemical potential mu as a\nfunction of B and see that the baryons repel each other. The way mu depends on\nB also allows us to translate our findings to the grand-canonical ensemble. The\nresulting phase structure along the mu-axis contains a phase transition that\noccurs at a value of mu equal to the baryon mass divided in N, and that\nseparates a mu-independent phase with intact translation symmetry from a\nmu-dependent phase with spontaneously broken translation symmetry. Finally, our\ncalculations confirm the presence of a partial large-N Eguchi-Kawai volume\nindependence, as described in Phys.Rev.D79:105021, that arises only if one\ntreats the gluonic zero modes correctly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jan 2009 16:21:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Jun 2009 16:29:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-19"}

This theory is referred to as the\n\"Thermodynamic Field Theory\" (TFT). The aim of the work was to determine the\nnonlinear flux-force relations that respect the thermodynamic theorems for\nsystems far from equilibrium. We propose a new formulation of the TFT where one\nof the basic restrictions, namely the closed-form solution for the\nskew-symmetric piece of the transport coefficients, has been removed. In\naddition, the general covariance principle is replaced by the De\nDonder-Prigogine thermodynamic covariance principle (TCP). The introduction of\nTCP requires the application of an appropriate mathematical formalism, which is\nreferred to as the \"entropy-covariant formalism\". By geometrical arguments, we\nprove the validity of the Glansdorff-Prigogine Universal Criterion of\nEvolution. A new set of closure equations determining the nonlinear corrections\nto the linear (\"Onsager\") transport coefficients is also derived. The geometry\nof the thermodynamic space is non-Riemannian. However, it tends to be\nRiemannian for high values of the entropy production. In this limit, we recover\nthe transport equations found by the old theory. Applications of our approach\nto transport in magnetically confined plasmas, materials submitted to\ntemperature and electric potential gradients or to unimolecular triangular\nchemical reactions can be found at references cited herein. Transport processes\nin tokamak plasmas are of particular interest. In this case, even in absence of\nturbulence, the state of the plasma remains close to (but, it is not in) a\nstate of local equilibrium. This prevents the transport relations from being\nlinear.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jan 2009 17:05:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2009 16:10:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 21 Jun 2015 08:47:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

From\ngeneric non-commuting matrices, it is difficult to extract physics, for\nexample, the shape of the distribution of positions of D-branes. To overcome\nthis problem, we generalize and elaborate on a simple prescription, first\nintroduced by Hotta, Nishimura and Tsuchiya, which determines the most\nappropriate gauge to make the separation between diagonal components (D-brane\npositions) and off-diagonal components. This prescription makes it possible to\nextract the distribution of D-branes directly from matrices. We verify the\npower of it by applying it to Monte-Carlo simulations for various lower\ndimensional Yang-Mills matrix models. In particular, we detect the topology\nchange of the D-brane bound state for a phase transition of a matrix model; the\nexistence of this phase transition is expected from the gauge/gravity duality,\nand the pattern of the topology change is strikingly similar to the counterpart\nin the gravity side, the black hole/black string transition. We also propose a\ncriterion, based on the behavior of the off-diagonal components, which\ndetermines when our prescription gives a sensible definition of D-brane\npositions. We provide numerical evidence that our criterion is satisfied for\nthe typical distance between D-branes. For a supersymmetric model, positions of\nD-branes can be defined even at a shorter distance scale. The behavior of\noff-diagonal elements found in this analysis gives some support for previous\nstudies of D-brane bound states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jan 2009 19:38:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-08"}

We study this signal in the context\nof R-symmetric supersymmetry, which allows for large flavor violation in the\nsquark sector, however the results can also be generalized to the MSSM. The\nsingle top signal arises from squark pair production in which one squark decays\nto a top and gaugino, whereas the other squark decays to a non-top quark and\ngaugino. We study three decay patterns: (I) squark decay into a quark and\nneutralino LSP; (II) squark decay into a quark and neutralino NLSP, with\nsubsequent decay of the NLSP to a photon and gravitino; (III) squark decay into\na quark and chargino NLSP, with subsequent decay of the NLSP to a H^\\pm/W^\\pm\nand gravitino. Case II is the most promising, when the NLSP decay is prompt,\nsince every event contains two hard photons that can be used to tag the events,\nreducing the background to a negligible level. Case I is promising if the\nneutralino LSP is bino-like. We carefully consider large SM backgrounds and\nidentify a series of cuts to isolate the signal.

It turns out that,\nfor a given sky area, the random errors for ages older than ~0.4 Gyr seem to be\nindependent of the crowding. For a spatial resolution of ~0.1 sqdeg, the random\nerrors in SFR(t) will be below 20% for this wide range of ages. On the other\nhand, due to the smaller stellar statistics for stars younger than ~0.4 Gyr,\nthe outer LMC regions will require larger areas to achieve the same level of\naccuracy in the SFR(t).

There are two\nadjustable parameters in this model: \\xi and the quark mass difference \\Delta\nm. We obtain the phase diagram on the (\\xi, \\Delta m) plane.

This paper argues that a strong case can be made for a\nstatic universe where the supernovae light-curve-width dependence on redshift\nis due to selection effects. The analysis is based on the principle that it is\nthe total energy (the fluence) and not the peak magnitude that is the best\n`standard candle' for type 1a supernovae. A simple model using a static\ncosmology provides an excellent prediction for the dependence of light curve\nwidth on redshift and the luminosity-width relationship for nearby supernovae.\nThe width dependence arises from the assumption of constant absolute magnitude\nresulting in strong selection of lower luminosity supernovae at higher\nredshifts due to the use of an incorrect distance modulus. Using a static\ncosmology, curvature-cosmology, and without fitting any parameters the analysis\nshows that the total energy is independent of redshift and provides a Hubble\nconstant of $63.1\\pm2.5$ kms$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$.

We\nextracted the cores from the simulated extinction maps, constructed the CMFs,\nand compared them to the input CMFs.

We find that the observed CMF\nrecovers the true CMF reliably when the mean separation of cores is larger than\ntheir mean diameter (f>1).

The diversity and\nabundance of miRNA targets offer an enormous level of combinatorial\npossibilities and suggest that miRNAs and their targets form a complex\nregulatory network. In the present study, we analyzed 711 miRNAs and their 34,\n525 predicted targets in the miRBase database which generate a complex\nbipartite network having numerous numbers of genes forming the hub. Genes at\nthe hub (total 9877) are significantly over represented in genes with specific\nmolecular functions, biological processes and biological pathways as revealed\nfrom the analysis using PANTHER.

This makes it possible to correct for the effects of beam smearing.\nThe dwarf galaxies in our sample have rotation-curve shapes that are similar to\nthose of late-type spiral galaxies, in the sense that their rotation curves,\nwhen expressed in units of disk scale lengths, rise as steeply in the inner\nparts and start to flatten at two disk scale lengths. None of the galaxies in\nour sample have solid-body rotation curves that extend beyond three scale\nlengths. The logarithmic outer rotation curve slopes are similar between\nlate-type dwarf and spiral galaxies. Thus, whether the flat part of the\nrotation curve is reached seems to depend more on the extent of the rotation\ncurve than on its amplitude. We also find that the outer rotation curve shape\ndoes not strongly depend on luminosity, at least for galaxies fainter than\nM_R~-19. We find that in spiral galaxies and in the central regions of\nlate-type dwarf galaxies, the shape of the central distribution of light and\nthe inner rise of the rotation curve are related. This implies that galaxies\nwith stronger central concentrations of light also have higher central mass\ndensities, and it suggests that the luminous mass dominates the gravitational\npotential in the central regions, even in low surface brightness dwarf\ngalaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jan 2009 11:14:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Recently, the survey of\npartially occulted flares observed by the RHESSI has been published (Krucker &\nLin 2008). The extensive YOHKOH database still awaits such activities. This\nwork is an attempt to fill this gap. Among from 1286 flares in the YOHKOH Hard\nX-ray Telescope Flare Catalogue, for which the hard X-ray images had been\nenclosed, we identified 98 events that occurred behind the solar limb. We\ninvestigated their hard X-ray spectra and spatial structure. We found that in\nmost cases the hard X-ray spectrum of partially occulted flares consists of two\ncomponents, non-thermal and thermal, which are co-spatial. The photon energy\nspectra of the partially occulted flares are systematically steeper than\nspectra of the non-occulted flares. Such a difference we explain as a\nconsequence of intrinsically dissimilar conditions ruling in coronal parts of\nflares, in comparison with the footpoints which usually dominate the hard X-ray\nemission of disk flares. At least two reasons of the difference should be taken\ninto consideration: (1) stronger contamination of hard X-rays with emission of\nthermal plasma, (2) different mechanism in which non-thermal electrons radiate\ntheir energy. A schematic picture, in which thin-target mechanism is\nresponsible for hard X-ray emission of loop-top sources and thick-target\nmechanism -- for emission of footpoint sources, can be modified by the presence\nof some coronal thick-target sources. At least a part of them suggests a\nmagnetic trapping. Investigated flares do not respond the global magnetic\nconfiguration of the solar corona. For their characteristics conclusive is\nrather the local magnetic configuration in which they were developed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jan 2009 11:44:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The actual form of the so--called radius--to--frequency mapping should\nbe reflected in the aberration--retardation (A/R) effects that shift and/or\ndelay the photons depending on the emission height in the magnetosphere. Recent\nstudies suggest that in a handful of pulsars the A/R effect can be discerned\nw.r.t the peak of the central core emission region. To verify these effects in\nan ensemble of pulsars we launched a project analysing multi--frequency total\nintensity pulsar profiles obtained from the new observations from the Giant\nMeterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT), Arecibo Observatory (AO) and archival\nEuropean Pulsar Network (EPN) data. For all these profiles we measure the shift\nof the outer cone components with respect to the core component which is\nnecessary for establishing the A/R effect. Within our sample of 23 pulsars 7\nshow the A/R effects, 12 of them (doubtful cases) show a tendency towards this\neffect, while the remaining 4 are obvious counter examples. The\ncounter--examples and doubtful cases may arise from uncertainties in\ndetermination of the location of the meridional plane and/or the core emission\ncomponent. It hence appears that the A/R effects are likely to operate in most\npulsars from our sample. We conclude that in cases where those effects are\npresent the core emission has to originate below the conal emission region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jan 2009 12:09:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Conical outflows flow from the inner edge of the disk into a narrow\nshell with half-opening angle of 30-45 degrees. The outflow carries about\n0.1-0.3 of the disk mass accretion rate and part of the disk's angular\nmomentum. The conical winds are driven by the gradient of the magnetic pressure\nwhich exists above the disk due to the winding of the stellar magnetic field.\nExploratory 3D simulations show that conical winds are symmetric about rotation\naxis of the disk even if the magnetic dipole is significantly misaligned with\nthe disk's rotation axis. Conical winds appear around stars of different\nperiods. However, in the case of a star in the \"propeller\" regime, an\nadditional - much faster component appears: an axial jet, where matter is\naccelerated up to very high velocities at small distances from the star by\nmagnetic pressure force above the surface of the star. The simulations are done\nin dimensionless units and are applicable to a variety of the disk-accreting\nmagnetized stars: young stars, white dwarfs, neutron stars, and possibly black\nholes. For the case of young stars, conical winds and axial jets may appear in\ndifferent cases, including Class I young stars, classical T Tauri stars, and\nEXors. In EXors periods of enhanced accretion may lead to the formation of\nconical winds which correspond to the outflows observed from these stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jan 2009 15:07:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-28"}

In this paper\nwe prove that MMSE regularized lattice decoding, as well as the computationally\nefficient lattice reduction (LR) aided MMSE decoder, allows for efficient and\nDMT optimal decoding of any approximately universal lattice-based code. The\nresult identifies for the first time an explicitly constructed encoder and a\ncomputationally efficient decoder that achieve DMT optimality for all\nmultiplexing gains and all channel dimensions. The results hold irrespective of\nthe fading statistics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jan 2009 15:21:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-28"}
