We find that only magnetic inclinations\ncorresponding to \"subluminal\" shocks, where relativistic particles following\nthe magnetic field can escape ahead of the shock, lead to particle\nacceleration. The downstream spectrum in such shocks consists of a relativistic\nMaxwellian and a high-energy power-law tail with exponential cutoff.

The classical model of cooperativity requires direct interactions\nbetween TFs, thus constraining the arrangement of TFs sites in a CRR. On the\ncontrary, genomic and functional studies demonstrate a great deal of\nflexibility in such arrangements with variable distances, numbers of sites, and\nidentities of the involved TFs. Such flexibility is inconsistent with the\ncooperativity by direct interactions between TFs. Here we demonstrate that\nstrong cooperativity among non-interacting TFs can be achieved by their\ncompetition with nucleosomes. We find that the mechanism of nucleosome-mediated\ncooperativity is mathematically identical to the Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC)\nmodel of cooperativity in hemoglobin. This surprising parallel provides deep\ninsights, with parallels between heterotropic regulation of hemoglobin (e.g.\nBohr effect) and roles of nucleosome-positioning sequences and chromatin\nmodifications in gene regulation. Characterized mechanism is consistent with\nnumerous experimental results, allows substantial flexibility in and modularity\nof CRRs, and provides a rationale for a broad range of genomic and evolutionary\nobservations. Striking parallels between cooperativity in hemoglobin and in\ntranscription regulation point at a new design principle that may be used in\nrange of biological systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jan 2009 18:07:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Nonetheless, there\nis evidence that knowledge of how confinement modifies static behavior can aid\nin forecasting dynamics. Specifically, molecular simulation studies have shown\nthat the relationship between excess entropy and self diffusivity of a bulk\nequilibrium fluid changes only modestly when the fluid is isothermally\nconfined, indicating that knowledge of the former might allow semi-quantitative\npredictions of the latter. Do other static measures, such as those that\ncharacterize free or available volume, also strongly correlate with\nsingle-particle dynamics of confined fluids? Here, we study this issue for both\nthe single-component hard-sphere fluid and hard-sphere mixtures. Specifically,\nwe use molecular simulations and fundamental measure theory to study these\nsystems at approximately $10^3$ equilibrium state points. We examine three\ndifferent confining geometries (slit pore, square channel, and cylindrical\npore) and the effects of packing fraction and particle-boundary interactions.\nAlthough density fails to predict some key qualitative trends for the dynamics\nof confined fluids, we find that a new generalized measure of available volume\nfor inhomogeneous fluids strongly correlates with the self diffusivity across a\nwide parameter space in these systems, approximately independent of the degree\nof confinement.

First, even with fixed accretion physics, AGN are\ndiluted/less luminous relative to their hosts; the magnitude of this depends on\nhost properties and so on luminosity and redshift. Second, they may transition\nto a radiatively inefficient state, changing SED shape and dramatically\ndecreasing in optical/IR luminosity. These effects lead to differences in\nobserved AGN samples, even at fixed bolometric luminosity and after correction\nfor obscuration. The true Eddington ratio distribution may depend strongly on\nluminosity, but this will be seen only in surveys robust to dilution and\nradiative inefficiency (X-ray or narrow-line samples); selection effects imply\nthat AGN in optical samples will have uniformly high mdot. This also implies\nthat different selection methods yield systems with different hosts: the\nclustering of faint optical/IR sources will be weaker than that of X-ray\nsources, and optical/IR Seyferts will reside in more disk-dominated galaxies\nwhile X-ray selected Seyferts will preferentially occupy early-type systems. If\nobserved mdot distributions are correct, a large fraction of low-luminosity AGN\ncurrently classified as 'obscured' are in fact diluted and/or radiatively\ninefficient, not obscured by gas or dust. This is equally true if X-ray\nhardness is used as a proxy for obscuration, since radiatively inefficient SEDs\nnear mdot~0.01 are X-ray hard. These effects can explain most of the claimed\nluminosity/redshift dependence in the 'obscured' AGN population, with the true\nobscured fraction as low as 20%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jan 2009 21:10:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2009 21:04:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

To date, such predictions have been based on\nsimulations that model the dark matter alone. Here we include the influence of\nthe baryonic matter for the first time. We use two different approaches.\nFirstly, we use dark matter only simulations to estimate the expected merger\nhistory for a Milky Way mass galaxy, and then add a thin stellar disc to\nmeasure its effect. Secondly, we use three cosmological hydrodynamic\nsimulations of Milky Way mass galaxies. In both cases, we find that a\nstellar/gas disc at high redshift (z~1) causes merging satellites to be\npreferentially dragged towards the disc plane. This results in an accreted dark\nmatter disc that contributes ~0.25 - 1 times the non-rotating halo density at\nthe solar position. An associated thick stellar disc forms with the dark disc\nand shares a similar velocity distribution. If these accreted stars can be\nseparated from those that formed in situ, future astronomical surveys will be\nable to infer the properties of the dark disc from these stars. The dark disc,\nunlike dark matter streams, is an equilibrium structure that must exist in disc\ngalaxies that form in a hierarchical cosmology. Its low rotation lag with\nrespect to the Earth significantly boosts WIMP capture in the Earth and Sun,\nincreases the likelihood of direct detection at low recoil energy, boosts the\nannual modulation signal, and leads to distinct variations in the flux as a\nfunction of recoil energy that allow the WIMP mass to be determined (see\ncontribution from T.

It also increases\nthe number of weak signals that contribute to the data. Because GW detectors\nhave nearly all-sky sensitivity, they can be subject to a confusion limit: Many\nsources which cannot be distinguished may be measured simultaneously, defining\na stochastic noise floor to the sensitivity. For GW detectors operating at\npresent and for their planned upgrades, the projected event rate is\nsufficiently low that we are far from the confusion-limited regime. However,\nsome detectors currently under discussion may have large enough reach to binary\ninspiral that they enter the confusion-limited regime. In this paper, we\nexamine the binary inspiral confusion limit for terrestrial detectors. We\nconsider a broad range of inspiral rates in the literature, several planned\nadvanced gravitational-wave detectors, and the highly advanced \"Einstein\nTelescope\" design.

The new feature is\nthat the equations of motion for the dynamics of such molecular strands are\nnonlocal when the screened Coulomb interactions, or Lennard-Jones potentials\nbetween pairs of charges are included. These nonlocal dynamical equations are\nderived in the convective representation of continuum motion by using modified\nEuler-Poincare and Hamilton-Pontryagin variational formulations that illuminate\nthe various approaches within the framework of symmetry reduction of Hamilton's\nprinciple for exact geometric rods. In the absence of nonlocal interactions,\nthe equations recover the classical Kirchhoff theory of elastic rods in the\nspatial representation. The motion equations in the convective representation\nare shown to be affine Euler-Poincare equations relative to a certain cocycle.\nThis property relates the geometry of the molecular strands to that of complex\nfluids. An elegant change of variables allows a direct passage from the\ninfinite dimensional point of view to the covariant formulation in terms of\nLagrange-Poincare equations. In another revealing perspective, the convective\nrepresentation of the nonlocal equations of molecular strand motion is\ntransformed into quaternionic form.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jan 2009 23:58:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-21"}

This provides us a\nstrategy to detect reliable solution from a given computed result. In this way,\nthe computational phenomena, such as computational chaos (CC), computational\nperiodicity (CP) and computational prediction uncertainty, which are mainly\nbased on long-term properties of computed time series, can be completely\navoided. So, this concept also provides us a time-scale to determine whether or\nnot a particular time is long enough for a given nonlinear dynamic system.\nBesides, the influence of data inaccuracy and various numerical schemes on the\ncritical predictable time is investigated in details by using symbolic\ncomputation software as a tool. A reliable chaotic solution of Lorenz equation\nin a rather large interval $0 \\leq t < 1200$ non-dimensional Lorenz time units\nis obtained for the first time. It is found that the precision of initial\ncondition and computed data at each time-step, which is mathematically\nnecessary to get such a reliable chaotic solution in such a long time, is so\nhigh that it is physically impossible due to the Heisenberg uncertainty\nprinciple in quantum physics. This however provides us a so-called \"precision\nparadox of chaos\", which suggests that the prediction uncertainty of chaos is\nphysically unavoidable, and that even the macroscopical phenomena might be\nessentially stochastic and thus could be described by probability more\neconomically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jan 2009 06:44:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-01"}

Next, we show that Skilling's method of induction leads us\nto a unique general theory of inductive inference, the ME method and precisely\nhow it is that other entropies such as those of Renyi or Tsallis are ruled out\nfor problems of inference. We then explore the compatibility of Bayes and ME\nupdating.

The realization that the ME method incorporates Bayes' rule as\na special case allows us to go beyond Bayes' rule and to process both data and\nexpected value constraints simultaneously. We discuss the general problem of\nnon-commuting constraints, when they should be processed sequentially and when\nsimultaneously. The generic \"canonical\" form of the posterior distribution for\nthe problem of simultaneous updating with data and moments is obtained. This is\na major achievement since it shows that ME is not only capable of processing\ninformation in the form of constraints, like MaxEnt and information in the form\nof data, as in Bayes' Theorem, but also can process both forms simultaneously,\nwhich Bayes and MaxEnt cannot do alone.

The MC gives\nrise to transport of energy and angular momentum between the black hole and the\ndisc, and the closed field lines pipe the hot matter evaporated from the disc,\nand shape it in the corona above the disc to form a magnetically induced\ndisc-corona system, in which the corona has the same configuration as the\nlarge-scale magnetic field. We numerically solve the dynamic equations in the\ncontext of the Kerr metric, in which the large-scale magnetic field is\ndetermined by dynamo process and equipartition between magnetic pressure and\ngas pressure. Thus we can obtain a global solution rather than assuming the\ndistribution of large-scale magnetic field beforehand. The main MC effects lie\nin three aspects. (1) The rotational energy of a fast-spinning black hole can\nbe extracted, enhancing the dissipation in the accretion disc, (2) the closed\nfield lines provide a natural channel for corona matter escaping from disc and\nfinally falling into black hole, and (3) the scope of the corona can be bounded\nby the conservation of magnetic flux. We simulate the high-energy spectra of\nthis system by using Monte-Carlo method, and find that the relative hardness of\nthe spectra decreases as accretion rate or black hole spin $a_*$ increases.

One of the possibilities that have been invoked is that an inefficient\ndeflagration leads to the pulsation of a Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf,\nfollowed by formation of an accretion shock around a carbon-oxygen rich core.\nThe accretion shock confines the core and transforms kinetic energy from the\ncollapsing halo into thermal energy of the core, until an inward moving\ndetonation is formed.

The small size of the corpus, the absence of bilingual texts, and the\nlack of definite knowledge of the underlying language has frustrated efforts at\ndecipherment since the discovery of the remains of the Indus civilisation.\nRecently, some researchers have questioned the premise that the Indus script\nencodes spoken language. Building on previous statistical approaches, we apply\nthe tools of statistical language processing, specifically $n$-gram Markov\nchains, to analyse the Indus script for syntax. Our main results are that the\nscript has well-defined signs which begin and end texts, that there is\ndirectionality and strong correlations in the sign order, and that there are\ngroups of signs which appear to have identical syntactic function. All these\nrequire no {\\it a priori} suppositions regarding the syntactic or semantic\ncontent of the signs, but follow directly from the statistical analysis. Using\ninformation theoretic measures, we find the information in the script to be\nintermediate between that of a completely random and a completely fixed\nordering of signs. Our study reveals that the Indus script is a structured sign\nsystem showing features of a formal language, but, at present, cannot\nconclusively establish that it encodes {\\it natural} language. Our $n$-gram\nMarkov model is useful for predicting signs which are missing or illegible in a\ncorpus of Indus texts.

To understand the functional role of\nthis self-sustained neural activity, and its interplay with the sensory data\ninput stream, is an important question in cognitive system research and we\nreview here the present state of theoretical modelling.\n  This review will start with a brief overview of the experimental efforts,\ntogether with a discussion of transient vs. self-sustained neural activity in\nthe framework of reservoir computing. The main emphasis will be then on two\nparadigmal neural network architectures showing continuously ongoing\ntransient-state dynamics: saddle point networks and networks of attractor\nrelics.\n  Self-active neural networks are confronted with two seemingly contrasting\ndemands: a stable internal dynamical state and sensitivity to incoming stimuli.\nWe show, that this dilemma can be solved by networks of attractor relics based\non competitive neural dynamics, where the attractor relics compete on one side\nwith each other for transient dominance, and on the other side with the\ndynamical influence of the input signals. Unsupervised and local Hebbian-style\nonline learning then allows the system to build up correlations between the\ninternal dynamical transient states and the sensory input stream. An emergent\ncognitive capability results from this set-up. The system performs online, and\non its own, a non-linear independent component analysis of the sensory data\nstream, all the time being continuously and autonomously active. This process\nmaps the independent components of the sensory input onto the attractor relics,\nwhich acquire in this way a semantic meaning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jan 2009 11:00:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-03"}

These sampling artifacts, especially aliasing, make further\nprocessing of the sampled signal difficult. For this reason we introduce a fast\nand efficient supersampling method, frequently applied in 3D computer graphics,\nto cosmological applications such as matter power spectrum estimation.
