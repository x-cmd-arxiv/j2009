Recent experiments have provided evidence for\nstates with broken rotation as well as translation symmetry, and will be\ndiscussed in terms of nematic and stripe physics. Of particular importance here\nare results obtained using the techniques of neutron and x-ray scattering and\nscanning tunneling spectroscopy. Ideas on the origin of lattice-symmetry-broken\nstates will be reviewed, and effective models accounting for various\nexperimentally observed phenomena will be summarized. These include both\nweak-coupling and strong-coupling approaches, with a discussion on their\ndistinctions and connections. The collected experimental data indicate that the\ntendency toward uni-directional stripe-like ordering is common to underdoped\ncuprates, but becomes weaker with increasing number of adjacent CuO_2 layers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jan 2009 16:11:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Jun 2009 09:08:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

In this problem, each\nof two separate transmitters observes a different component of a memoryless\nbi-variate Gaussian source. The two transmitters then describe their source\ncomponent to a common receiver via an average-power constrained Gaussian\nmultiple-access channel. From the output of the multiple-access channel, the\nreceiver wishes to reconstruct each source component with the least possible\nexpected squared-error distortion. Our interest is in characterizing the\ndistortion pairs that are simultaneously achievable on the two source\ncomponents.\n  We present sufficient conditions and necessary conditions for the\nachievability of a distortion pair. These conditions are expressed as a\nfunction of the channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and of the source\ncorrelation. In several cases the necessary conditions and sufficient\nconditions are shown to agree. In particular, we show that if the channel SNR\nis below a certain threshold, then an uncoded transmission scheme is optimal.\nWe also derive the precise high-SNR asymptotics of an optimal scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jan 2009 19:14:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

We revisit the\nquestion of what can be learnt about the spatial geometry of the Universe from\nthe perspective of a three-way Bayesian model comparison. We show that, given\ncurrent data, the probability that the Universe is spatially infinite lies\nbetween 67% and 98%, depending on the choice of priors. For the strongest prior\nchoice, we find odds of order 50:1 (200:1) in favour of a flat Universe when\ncompared with a closed (open) model. We also report a robust, prior-independent\nlower limit to the number of Hubble spheres in the Universe, N_U > 5 (at 99%\nconfidence). We forecast the accuracy with which future CMB and BAO\nobservations will be able to constrain curvature, finding that a cosmic\nvariance limited CMB experiment together with an SKA-like BAO observation will\nconstrain curvature with a precision of about sigma ~ 4.5x10^{-4}. We\ndemonstrate that the risk of 'model confusion' (i.e., wrongly favouring a flat\nUniverse in the presence of curvature) is much larger than might be assumed\nfrom parameter errors forecasts for future probes. We argue that a 5-sigma\ndetection threshold guarantees a confusion- and ambiguity-free model selection.\nTogether with inflationary arguments, this implies that the geometry of the\nUniverse is not knowable if the value of the curvature parameter is below\n|Omega_curvature| ~ 10^{-4}, a bound one order of magnitude larger than the\nsize of curvature perturbations, ~ 10^{-5}.

We also\nshow that any Bondi-Hoyle accretion of contaminated residual gas from the natal\nstar cluster made a negligible contribution to the primordial Al-26 inventory\nof the Solar System. These results are consistent with the absence of the\noxygen isotopic signature expected with any late introduction of supernova\nejecta into the protoplanetary disk.

(2001). We demonstrate that this can\nbe explained through differences in black hole fueling and triggering\nmechanisms, and a dichotomy in host galaxy properties of weak and powerful AGN.\nOur findings suggest that high and low radio-power AGN activity is triggered in\ndifferent stages during the formation of massive red galaxies. We show that\nweak radio AGN occur in the most massive galaxies already at z~1, and they may\nsignificantly contribute to the heating of their surrounding medium and thus\ninhibit gas accretion onto their host galaxies, as recently suggested for the\n`radio mode' in cosmological models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jan 2009 22:26:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-06"}

We apply an\nellipse parameterisation of the front to extract the kinematics (height,\nvelocity, acceleration) and changing morphology (width, orientation).\n  The kinematic evolution of the CMEs discussed in this paper have been shown\nto differ from existing catalogues. These catalogues are based upon\nrunning-difference techniques that can lead to over-estimating CME heights. Our\nresulting kinematic curves are not well-fitted with the constant acceleration\nmodel. It is shown that some events have high acceleration below $\\sim$5\nR$_{\\sun}$. Furthermore, we find that the CME angular widths measured by these\ncatalogues are over-estimated, and indeed for some events our analysis shows\nnon-constant CME expansion across the plane-of-sky.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jan 2009 02:15:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-20"}

Large weak lensing surveys of ~20,000 galaxy clusters\nand groups will be key tools in the observational pursuit of that goal. These\nweak lensing studies often proceed by stacking the lensing signals of many\nclusters and groups binned by mass-correlated observables such as richness and\nluminosity; typically such analyses ignore the triaxial structure of dark\nmatter halos on the assumption that the averaging of many shear signals within\neach mass bin makes its effects (as large as factors of two in mass model\nparameter estimates from individual clusters) negligible. We test this\nassumption and find that triaxiality can bias 3D virial mass estimates compared\nto those for a spherical population by a few percent if suboptimal mass\nestimators are used. This bias affects not only direct lensing constraints on\nthe mass function but can also affect the scatter and normalization of the\nmass-observable relations derived from lensing that are so crucial to\nconstraining the cluster mass function with large samples. However, we\ndemonstrate that a careful choice of mass estimator can remove the bias very\neffectively if the lensing signals from a sufficient number of triaxial halos\nare averaged together, and further quantify that sufficient number for adequate\nshape averaging. We thus show that by choosing observable bins to contain an\nadequate number of halos and by utilizing a carefully chosen 3D mass estimator\nstacked weak-lensing analyses can give unbiased constraints on the triaxial\nmass function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jan 2009 09:28:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The calculations are performed\nwith the help of Painleve-Gullstrand's coordinates which are associated with a\nradially free-falling observer that starts at rest from infinity. It is shown\nthat if the energy per unit rest mass, e, is assumed to be related to the the\nKilling constant, k, by k = sqrt(2e -1) then e, must be greater than 1/2. For\nparticles that are confined below the event horizon (EH), k is negative. In the\nquantum creation of particle pairs at the EH with k = 1, the time component of\nthe particle's four velocity that lies below the EH is compatible only with the\ntime component of an outgoing particle above the EH, i.e, the outside particle\ncannot fall back on the black hole. Energy conservation requires that the\nparticles inside, and outside the EH have the same value of e, and be created\nat equal distances from the EH, (1 - rin = rout - 1). Global energy\nconservation forces then the mass of the particle below the EH to be negative,\nand equal to minus the mass the particle above the EH, i.e, the black hole\nlooses energy as a consequence of pair production.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jan 2009 11:48:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-23"}

Here we present a postprocessing technique for such\nnumerical forecasts that produces correlated probabilistic forecasts of\nprecipitation accumulation at multiple sites simultaneously. The statistical\nmodel is a spatial version of a two-stage model that represents the\ndistribution of precipitation by a mixture of a point mass at zero and a Gamma\ndensity for the continuous distribution of precipitation accumulation. Spatial\ncorrelation is captured by assuming that two Gaussian processes drive\nprecipitation occurrence and precipitation amount, respectively. The first\nprocess is latent and drives precipitation occurrence via a threshold. The\nsecond process explains the spatial correlation in precipitation accumulation.\nIt is related to precipitation via a site-specific transformation function, so\nas to retain the marginal right-skewed distribution of precipitation while\nmodeling spatial dependence. Both processes take into account the information\ncontained in the numerical weather forecast and are modeled as stationary\nisotropic spatial processes with an exponential correlation function. The\ntwo-stage spatial model was applied to 48-hour-ahead forecasts of daily\nprecipitation accumulation over the Pacific Northwest in 2004.

Noteworthy applications\ninclude weather states as described by weather variables over a region and\nspeech patterns as characterized by frequencies in time. The SOM approach is\nessentially a neural network model that implements a nonlinear projection from\na high-dimensional input space to a low-dimensional array of neurons. In the\nprocess, it also becomes a clustering technique, assigning to any vector in the\nhigh-dimensional data space the node (neuron) to which it is closest (using,\nsay, Euclidean distance) in the data space. The number of nodes is thus equal\nto the number of clusters. However, the primary use for the SOM is as a\nrepresentation technique, that is, finding a set of nodes which\nrepresentatively span the high-dimensional space. These nodes are typically\ndisplayed using maps to enable visualization of the continuum of the data\nspace. The technique does not appear to have been discussed in the statistics\nliterature so it is our intent here to bring it to the attention of the\ncommunity. The technique is implemented algorithmically through a training set\nof vectors. However, through the introduction of stochasticity in the form of a\nspace--time process model, we seek to illuminate and interpret its performance\nin the context of application to daily data collection. That is, the observed\ndaily state vectors are viewed as a time series of multivariate process\nrealizations which we try to understand under the dimension reduction achieved\nby the SOM procedure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jan 2009 15:12:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-23"}

There are several progenitor\nmodels for SNe Ia proposed in the past years. In this paper, we have carried\nout a detailed study of the He star donor channel, in which a carbon-oxygen\nwhite dwarf (CO WD) accretes material from a He main sequence star or a He\nsubgiant to increase its mass to the Chandrasekhar mass. Employing Eggleton's\nstellar evolution code with an optically thick wind assumption, and adopting\nthe prescription of Kato & Hachisu (2004) for the mass accumulation efficiency\nof the He-shell flashes onto the WDs, we performed binary evolution\ncalculations for about 2600 close WD binary systems. According to these\ncalculations, we mapped out the initial parameters for SNe Ia in the orbital\nperiod--secondary mass ($\\log P^{\\rm i}-M^{\\rm i}_2$) plane for various WD\nmasses from this channel. The study shows that the He star donor channel is\nnoteworthy for producing SNe Ia (i.e. $\\sim 1.2\\times10^{-3} {\\rm yr}^{-1}$ in\nthe Galaxy), and that the progenitors from this channel may appear as supersoft\nX-ray sources.
