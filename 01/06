In this paper,\nwe present a survey of concrete models realizing such a scenario, followed by a\nlargely model-independent study of collider phenomenology relevant to the\nTevatron and the LHC. We address some model building issues that are easily\nsurmounted to accommodate the astrophysics. While SUSY is not necessary, we\nargue that it is theoretically well-motivated because the GeV scale is\nautomatically generated. Specifically, we propose a novel mechanism by which\nmixed D-terms in the dark sector induce either SUSY breaking or a super-Higgs\nmechanism precisely at a GeV. Furthermore, we elaborate on the original\nproposal of Arkani-Hamed et al. in which the dark matter acts as a messenger of\ngauge mediation to the dark sector. In our collider analysis we present\ncross-sections for dominant production channels and lifetime estimates for\nprimary decay modes. We find that dark gauge bosons can be produced at the\nTevatron and the LHC, either through a process analogous to prompt photon\nproduction or through a rare Z decay channel. Dark gauge bosons will decay back\nto the SM via \"lepton jets\" which typically contain >2 and as many as 8\nleptons, significantly improving their discovery potential. Since SUSY decays\nfrom the MSSM will eventually cascade down to these lepton jets, the discovery\npotential for direct electroweak-ino production may also be improved.\nExploiting the unique kinematics, we find that it is possible to reconstruct\nthe mass of the MSSM LSP. We also present decay channels with displaced\nvertices and multiple leptons with partially correlated impact parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jan 2009 19:51:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Apr 2009 12:11:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-17"}

We\nconsider seven types of effects which are related to known instrumental\nsystematics: calibration, rotation, pointing, spin-flip, monopole leakage,\ndipole leakage and quadrupole leakage. These effects can be characterized by 11\ndistortion fields. Each of these systematic effects can mimic the effective\nprojected matter power spectrum and hence contaminate the lensing\nreconstruction. To demonstrate the effect of these instrumental systematics, we\nconsider two types of experiments, one with a detector noise level for\npolarization of 9.6 uK-arcmin and FWHM of 8.0', typical of upcoming ground and\nballoon-based CMB experiments, and a CMBPol-like instrument with a detector\nnoise level for polarization of 2.0 uK-arcmin and FWHM of 4.0', typical of\nfuture space-based CMB experiments. For each systematics, we consider various\nchoices of coherence scale. Among all the 11 systematic parameters, rotation\nand monopole leakage place the most stringent requirements, while quadrupole\nleakage, pointing error, and calibration are among the least demanding. The\nrequirements from lensing extraction are about 1-2 orders of magnitude less\nstringent than the requirements to measure the primordial B-modes with\ninflationary energy scale of 1.0*10^{16} GeV.

Aims: Grain surface and\ngas phase formation of HD and H2 is investigated to assess the importance of\ntrace amounts of dust, 10^{-5}-10^{-3} Zo, in the production of HD and H2.\nMethods: We consider carbonaceous and silicate grains and include both\nphysisorption and chemisorption, tunneling, and realistic grain surface\nbarriers. We find, for a collapsing gas cloud environment with coupled chemical\nand thermal balance, that dust abundances as small as 10^{-5} solar lead to a\nstrong boost in the H2 formation rate due to surface reactions. As a result of\nthis enhancement in H2, HD is formed more efficiently in the gas phase through\nthe D+ + H2 reaction.

Results: Grain surface\nreactions are crucial to the availability of H2 and HD in very metal-poor\nenvironments.

For such channels, capacity does\nnot tend to infinity as the SNR tends to infinity. In contrast, if the\nvariances of the path gains decay faster than exponentially, then capacity is\nunbounded in the SNR. It is further demonstrated that if the number of paths is\nfinite, then at high SNR capacity grows double-logarithmically with the SNR,\nand the capacity pre-loglog, defined as the limiting ratio of capacity to\nlog(log(SNR)) as SNR tends to infinity, is 1 irrespective of the number of\npaths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jan 2009 20:59:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-06"}

Our sample of 51 early-type\ngalaxies encompasses a comprehensive mass range from dwarf to brightest cluster\ngalaxies. The metallicity gradients are measured out to one effective radius by\ncomparing nearly all of the Lick absorption-line indices to recent models of\nsingle stellar populations. The relation shows very different behaviour at low\nand high masses, with a sharp transition being seen at a mass of ~ 3.5 x 10^10\nM_sun (velocity dispersion of ~140 km/s, M_B ~ -19). Low-mass galaxies form a\ntight relation with mass, such that metallicity gradients become shallower with\ndecreasing mass and positive at the very low-mass end. Above the mass\ntransition point several massive galaxies have steeper gradients, but a clear\ndownturn is visible marked by a broad scatter. The results are interpreted in\ncomparison with competing model predictions. We find that an early star-forming\ncollapse could have acted as the main mechanism for the formation of low-mass\ngalaxies, with star formation efficiency increasing with galactic mass. The\nhigh-mass downturn could be a consequence of merging and the observed larger\nscatter a natural result of different merger properties.

The varying efficiency of the dissipative merger-induced\nstarburst and feedback processes have shaped the radial metallicity gradients\nin these high-mass systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jan 2009 21:21:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

(I): The effective theory of inflation a la\nGinsburg-Landau (GL): the inflaton potential is a polynomial with universal\nform making explicit the inflation energy scale M, the Planck mass and the\ninflation e-folds number N ~ 60. The slow-roll expansion becomes a systematic\n1/N expansion and the inflaton couplings are naturally small as powers of\n(M/M_{Pl})^2. The spectral index (n_s - 1) and the ratio of tensor/scalar\nfluctuations r are O(1/N), the running index is O(1/N^2). M ~ 0.7 10^{16} GeV\nis completely determined by the scalar adiabatic fluctuations amplitude. (II):\nA Monte Carlo Markov Chains (MCMC) analysis of the CMB+LSS data (including\nWMAP5) with our analytic theoretical results yields: a lower bound for r (new\ninflation): r > 0.023 (95%CL), r > 0.046 (68%CL); the preferred inflation\npotential is a double well, even function of the field yielding as most\nprobable values n_s ~ 0.964, r ~ 0.051. This value for r is within reach of\nforthcoming CMB observations. Slow-roll inflation is generically preceded by a\nshort fast-roll stage which leads to a suppression of the CMB quadrupoles. MCMC\nanalysis of the WMAP+SDSS data shows that fast-roll fits the TT, TE and EE\nmodes well reproducing the quadrupole suppression and fixes the total number of\nefolds of inflation to be N_{total} ~ 64. (III) Quantum loop corrections are\nvery small and controlled by powers of (H /M_{Pl})^2 ~ 10^{-9} which validates\nthe effective theory of inflation.

Many studies of the\nSFR at intermediate redshifts have been made as a function of the integrated\nstellar mass of galaxies but these did not use information on the internal\nstructural properties of the galaxies. In this paper we present a comparative\nstudy of the dependence of SFRs on the average surface mass densities (SigmaM)\nof galaxies of different morphological types up to z~1 using the zCOSMOS and\nSDSS surveys. The main findings about the evolution of these relatively massive\ngalaxies are: 1) There is evidence that, for both SDSS ans zCOSMOS galaxies,\nthe mean specific SFR within a given population (either disk-dominated or\nbulge-dominated) is independent of SigmaM; 2) The observed SSFR - SigmaM\nstep-function relation is due, at all investigated redshifts, to the changing\nmix of disk-dominated and bulge-dominated galaxies as surface density increases\nand the strong difference in the average SSFR between disks and bulges. We also\nfind a modest differential evolution in the size-mass relations of disk and\nspheroid galaxies; 3) The shape of the median SSFR - SigmaM relation is\nsimilar, but with median SSFR values that are about 5-6 times higher in zCOSMOS\ngalaxies than for SDSS, across the whole range of SigmaM, and in both spheroid\nand disk galaxies. This increase matches that of the global SFRD of the\nUniverse as a whole, emphasizing that galaxies of all types are contributing,\nproportionally, to the global increase in SFRD in the Universe back to these\nredshifts (abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jan 2009 21:23:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2009 12:16:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

A new similarity measure, motivated by the resource allocation\nprocess taking place on networks, is proposed and shown to have higher\nprediction accuracy than common neighbors. It is found that many links are\nassigned same scores if only the information of the nearest neighbors is used.\nWe therefore design another new measure exploited information of the next\nnearest neighbors, which can remarkably enhance the prediction accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jan 2009 21:03:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2009 17:19:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-19"}

The\nabundance of elemental oxygen in the ices appears to be a unifying factor,\ndisplaying consistent behavior in the three clouds.

We\ndetect a series of A-X bandheads from CO and estimate N(CO) = 10^16.5 cm^-2 and\nT_ex^CO > 100K. We argue that the high excitation temperature results from UV\npumping of the CO gas by the GRB afterglow. Similarly, we observe H2 absorption\nvia the Lyman-Werner bands and estimate N(H2) = 10^21.2 cm^-2 with T_ex^H2 =\n10--300K. The afterglow photometry suggests an extinction law with R_V=4 and\nA_V=3.2 mag and requires the presence of a modest 2175A bump. Additionally,\nmodeling of the Swift/XRT X-ray spectrum confirms a large column density with\nN(H) = 10^22.58 cm^-2. Remarkably, this molecular gas has extinction\nproperties, metallicity, and a CO/H2 ratio comparable to those of translucent\nmolecular clouds of the Milky Way, suggesting that star formation at high z\nproceeds in similar environments as today.

Measuring the\n(of order 10 mK) mean brightness temperature of the redshifted 21 cm line as a\nfunction of frequency (and hence redshift) would chart the early evolution of\ngalaxies through the heating and ionizing of the IGM by their stellar\npopulations. Experiments are already underway to accomplish this task or, at\nleast, provide basic constraints on the evolution of the mean brightness\ntemperature. We provide a brief overview of one of these projects, the\nExperiment to the Detect the Global EOR Signature (EDGES), and discuss\nprospects for future results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jan 2009 22:13:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-23"}

The use of a dynamic procedure, which involves sampling or\ntest-filtering of super-grid turbulence dynamics and subsequent use of\nscale-invariance for two levels, circumvents the need for empiricism in\ndetermining the magnitude of the model coefficient of the SGS models. We employ\nthe multiple relaxation times (MRT) formulation of LBM with a forcing term for\nsimulation of the grid-filtered dynamics of large-eddies. The dynamic procedure\nis illustrated for use with the common Smagorinsky eddy-viscosity SGS model. We\nalso discuss proper sampling techniques or test-filters that facilitate\nimplementation of dynamic models in the LBM. For accommodating variable\nresolutions, we employ locally refined grids in this framework. As examples, we\nconsider the canonical fully developed turbulent channel flow at two different\nshear Reynolds numbers $Re_{*}$ of 180 and 395. The approach is able to\nautomatically and self-consistently compute the values of the Smagorinsky\ncoefficient, $C_S$.

A high-mass IMF with the typical mass~10Msun\nand the overwhelming contribution of low-mass members of binaries to the EMP\nsurvivors are derived from the statistics of carbon-enriched EMP stars with and\nwithout the enhancement of s-process elements (Komiya et al. 2007). We first\nexamine the analysis to confirm their results for various assumptions on the\nmass-ratio distribution function. As compared with the uniform distribution,\nthe increase or decrease function of the mass ratio gives a higher- or\nlower-mass IMF, and a lower-mass IMF results for the independent distribution\nwith the both members in the same IMF, but the derived ranges of typical mass\ndiffer less than by a factor of two and overlap for the extreme cases.\nFurthermore, we prove that the same constraints are placed on the IMF from the\nsurface density of EMP stars estimated from the surveys and the chemical\nevolution consistent with the metal yields of theoretical supernova models. We\nthen apply the derived high-mass IMF with the binary contribution to show that\nthe observed MDF of EMP stars can be reproduced not only for the shape but also\nfor the number of EMP stars. In particular, the scarcity of stars below\n[Fe/H]<-4 is naturally explained in terms of the hierarchical structure\nformation, and there is no indication of significant changes in the IMF for the\nEMP Population. The present study indicates that 3 HMP stars of [Fe/H]<-4 are\nthe primordial stars that were born as the low-mass members of binaries before\nthe host clouds were polluted by their own supernovae.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jan 2009 10:27:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

The quality of estimation is measured in terms of the rate function\nrelated to the contrast, thus allowing to derive exponential risk bounds\ninvariant with respect to the detailed probabilistic structure of the model.\nThis approach works well for small or moderate samples and covers the case of a\nmisspecified parametric model. Another important feature of the presented\nbounds is that they may be used in the case when the parametric set is\nunbounded and non-compact. These bounds do not rely on the entropy or covering\nnumbers and can be easily computed. The most important statistical fact\nresulting from the exponential bonds is a concentration inequality which claims\nthat minimum contrast estimators concentrate with a large probability on the\nlevel set of the rate function. In typical situations, every such set is a\nroot-n neighborhood of the parameter of interest. We also show that the\nobtained bounds can help for bounding the estimation risk, constructing\nconfidence sets for the underlying parameters. Our general results are\nillustrated for the case of an i.i.d. sample. We also consider several popular\nexamples including least absolute deviation estimation and the problem of\nestimating the location of a change point. What we obtain in these examples\nslightly differs from the usual asymptotic results presented in statistical\nliterature. This difference is due to the unboundness of the parameter set and\na possible model misspecification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jan 2009 14:31:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-07"}
