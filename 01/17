We find that all graviton amplitudes\ncan be written in terms of exactly the same structure of nested sums with two\nmodifications: the dual superconformal invariants are promoted from N=4 to N=8\nsuperspace in the simplest manner possible--by squaring them--and certain\nadditional non-dual conformal gravity dressing factors (independent of the\nsuperspace coordinates) are inserted into the nested sums.

Inspired by the well known fact that the U_A(1) anomaly could induce\nfirst order phase transitions, we study the effect of the possible restoration\nof the U_A(1) symmetry at finite density. In particular, we explore the link\nbetween the U_A(1) restoration and the recent lattice QCD results of de\nForcrand and Philipsen, in which the first order phase transition region near\nzero chemical potential (mu) shrinks in the quark mass and mu space when mu is\nincreased. Starting from the Ginzburg-Landau theory for general discussions, we\nthen use the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model for quantitative studies. With the\npartial U_A(1) restoration modeled by the density dependent 't Hooft\ninteraction, we fit the shrinking of the critical surface found in de Forcrand\nand Philipsen's lattice calculation at low mu. At higher mu, the critical\nsurface might shrink or expand, depending on the scenarios. This raises the\npossibility that despite the shrinking of the critical surface at lower mu, the\nQCD critical end point might still exist due to the expansion at higher mu. In\nthis case, very high precision lattice data will be needed to detect the\nback-bending of the critical surface with the currently available analytic\ncontinuation or Taylor expansion approaches.

First, the local H2-mass function (MF) is estimated from the local\nCO-luminosity function (LF) of the FCRAO Extragalactic CO-Survey, adopting a\nvariable CO-to-H2 conversion fitted to nearby observations. This implies an\naverage H2-density Omega_H2=(6.9+-2.7) 10^5/h and Omega_H2/Omega_HI=0.26+-0.11\nin the local Universe. Second, we investigate the correlations between Rmol and\nglobal galaxy properties in a sample of 245 local galaxies. Based on these\ncorrelations we introduce four phenomenological models for Rmol, which we apply\nto estimate H2-masses for each HI-galaxy in the HIPASS catalogue. The resulting\nH2-MFs (one for each model for Rmol) are compared to the reference H2-MF\nderived from the CO-LF, thus allowing us to determine the Bayesian evidence of\neach model and to identify a clear best model, in which, for spiral galaxies,\nRmol negatively correlates with both galaxy Hubble type and total gas mass.\nThird, we derive a theoretical model for Rmol for regular galaxies based on an\nexpression for their axially symmetric pressure profile dictating the degree of\nmolecularization. This model is quantitatively similar to the best\nphenomenological one at redshift z=0, and hence represents a consistent\ngeneralization while providing a physical explanation for the dependence of\nRmol on global galaxy properties. Applying the best phenomenological model for\nRmol to the HIPASS sample, we derive the first integral cold gas-MF\n(HI+H2+helium) of the local Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jan 2009 16:46:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Jan 2009 12:10:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2009 23:54:43 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2009 22:10:52 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2009 11:01:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-17"}

The array of possible high-energy power-law indices\nin accelerated populations is highlighted, focusing on how spectra above 1 MeV\ncan probe the field obliquity in GRB internal shocks, and the character of\nhydromagnetic turbulence in their environs.

This result is\nsignificant at about the 1 $\\sigma$ level in each cluster. For the complete set\nof clusters we reject the null hypothesis--that Solar and intermediate-mass\nstars lose their disks at the same rate--with 95-99.9% confidence. To interpret\nthis behaviour, we investigate the impact of grain growth, binary companions,\nand photoevaporation on the evolution of disk signatures. Changes in grain\ngrowth timescales at fixed disk temperature may explain why early-type stars\nwith IR excesses appear to evolve faster than their later-type counterparts.\nLittle evidence that binary companions affect disk evolution suggests that\nphotoevaporation is the more likely mechanism for disk dispersal. A simple\nphotoevaporation model provides a good fit to the observed disk fractions for\nSolar and intermediate-mass stars. Although the current mass-dependent disk\ndispersal signal is not strong, larger and more complete samples of clusters\nwith ages of 3-5 Myr can improve the significance and provide better tests of\ntheoretical models. In addition, the orbits of extra-Solar planets can\nconstrain models of disk dispersal and migration. We suggest that the signature\nof stellar mass dependent disk dispersal due to photoevaporation may be present\nin the orbits of observed extra Solar planets. Planets orbiting hosts more\nmassive than ~1.6 Msun may have larger orbits because the disks in which they\nformed were dispersed before they could migrate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Jan 2009 01:44:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

The model consist\nof two distinct zones: an inner relativistic outflow, which we identify with\nthe observed jet, and an outer cold disk-wind. While the former does not\nself-collimate efficiently due to its high effective inertia, the latter\nfulfills all the conditions for efficient collimation by the\nmagneto-centrifugal mechanism. Given the right balance between the effective\ninertia of the inner flow and the collimation efficiency of the outer disk\nwind, the relativistic flow is magnetically confined into a well collimated\nbeam and matches the measurements of the opening angle of M87 over several\norders of magnitude in spatial extent. The synthetic synchrotron maps reproduce\nthe morphological structure of the jet of M87, i.e. center-bright profiles near\nthe core and limb-bright profiles away from the core. At the same time, they\nalso show a local increase of brightness at some distance along the axis\nassociated to a recollimation shock in the MHD model. Its location coincides\nwith the position of the optical knot HST-1. In addition our best fitting model\nis consistent with a number of observational constraints such as the magnetic\nfield in the knot HST-1, and the jet-to-counterjet brightness ratio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Jan 2009 13:23:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

Because of the enormous\nrange of scales involved and the high dimensionality of the problem, resolved\nfirst-principles global simulations are very challenging using conventional\n(brute force) techniques. In this thesis, the problem of resolving turbulence\nis addressed by developing velocity space resolution diagnostics and an\nadaptive collisionality that allow for the confident simulation of velocity\nspace dynamics using the approximate minimal necessary dissipation. With regard\nto the wide range of scales, a new approach has been developed in which\nturbulence calculations from multiple gyrokinetic flux tube simulations are\ncoupled together using transport equations to obtain self-consistent,\nsteady-state background profiles and corresponding turbulent fluxes and\nheating. This approach is embodied in a new code, Trinity, which is capable of\nevolving equilibrium profiles for multiple species, including electromagnetic\neffects and realistic magnetic geometry, at a fraction of the cost of\nconventional global simulations. Furthermore, an advanced model physical\ncollision operator for gyrokinetics has been derived and implemented, allowing\nfor the study of collisional turbulent heating, which has not been extensively\nstudied.
