The resulting\nexpressions are valid to leading order in the electromagnetic coupling constant\nbut non-perturbatively in the SU(Nc) interactions and the mass of the quark. We\nobtain this quantity by computing the imaginary part of the hadronic vacuum\npolarization function Pi_q using holographic techniques, providing an\nalternative to the known method that uses the spectrum of infinitely stable\nmesons determined by the normalizable modes of the appropriated fields in the\nbulk. Our result exhibits a structure of poles localized at specific real\nvalues of q^2, which coincide with the ones found using the normalizable modes,\nand extends it offering the unique analytic continuation of this distribution\nto a function defined for values of q^2 over the complex plane. This analytic\ncontinuation permits to include a finite decay width for the mesons. By\ncomparison with experimental data we find qualitatively good agreement on the\nshape of the first pole, when using the rho meson parameters and choosing a\nproper normalization factor.

While past assessments were based on only the inspiral/ring-down\npieces of the coalescence signal, the recent progress in analytical and\nnumerical relativity enables us to make more accurate projections using\n\"complete\" inspiral-merger-ringdown waveforms. We employ the Fisher matrix\nformalism to estimate how accurately the source parameters will be measurable\nusing a single interferometer as well as a network of interferometers. Those\nestimates are further vetted by Monte-Carlo simulations. We find that the\nparameter accuracies of the complete waveform are, in general, significantly\nbetter than those of just the inspiral waveform in the case of binaries with\ntotal mass M > 20 M_sun. For the case of the Advanced LIGO detector, parameter\nestimation is the most accurate in the M=100-200 M_sun range. For an M=100M_sun\nsystem, the errors in measuring the total mass and the symmetric mass-ratio are\nreduced by an order of magnitude or more compared to inspiral waveforms. For\nbinaries located at a luminosity distance d_L and observed with the Advanced\nLIGO--Advanced Virgo network, the sky-position error varies widely across the\nsky: For M=100M_sun systems at d_L=1Gpc, this variation ranges from ~0.01\nsquare-degrees to one square-degree, with an average value of ~0.1\nsquare-degrees. This is more than forty times better than the average\nsky-position accuracy of inspiral waveforms at this mass-range. The error in\nestimating d_L is dominated by the error in measuring the wave's polarization\nand is ~43% for low-mass binaries and ~23% for high-mass binaries located at\nd_L=1Gpc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jan 2009 17:24:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 31 Jan 2009 18:50:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 27 Mar 2009 06:23:54 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2009 15:38:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

We obtained a total of 20 ks of CXO\nobservation time of Fragment B, and also investigated contemporaneous ACE and\nSOHO solar wind physical data. The CXO data allow us to spatially resolve the\ndetailed structure of the interaction zone between the solar wind and the\nfragment's coma at a resolution of ~ 1,000 km, and to observe the X-ray\nemission due to multiple comet--like bodies. We detect a change in the spectral\nsignature with the ratio of the CV/OVII line increasing with increasing\ncollisional opacity as predicted by Bodewits \\e (2007). The line fluxes arise\nfrom a combination of solar wind speed, the species that populate the wind and\nthe gas density of the comet. We are able to understand some of the observed\nX-ray morphology in terms of non-gravitational forces that act upon an actively\noutgassing comet's debris field. We have used the results of the Chandra\nobservations on the highly fragmented 73P/B debris field to re-analyze and\ninterpret the mysterious emission seen from comet C/1999 S4 (LINEAR) on August\n1st, 2000, after the comet had completely disrupted. We find the physical\nsituations to be similar in both cases, with extended X-ray emission due to\nmultiple, small outgassing bodies in the field of view. Nevertheless, the two\ncomets interacted with completely different solar winds, resulting in\ndistinctly different spectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jan 2009 18:05:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

Where is the\n(pseudo)bulge in NGC 4565? We use archival Hubble Space Telescope K-band and\nSpitzer Space Telescope 3.6 um images to penetrate the dust in NGC 4565. We\nfind a high surface brightness, central stellar component, distinct from the\nboxy bar and from the galaxy's disk. Its minor-axis profile has a Sersic index\nof 1.33+/-0.12, so it is a pseudobulge. The pseudobulge has the smallest scale\nheight (~90 pc) of any component in the galaxy, in contrast to ~740 pc for the\nboxy bar plus thin disk. The disky pseudobulge is also much less luminous than\nthe boxy bar, so the true (pseudo)bulge-to-total luminosity ratio of the galaxy\nis much less than previously thought. We infer that the pseudobulge-to-total\nluminosity ratios of edge-on galaxies with box-shaped bulges have generally\nbeen overestimated. Therefore more galaxies than we have recognized contain\nlittle or no evidence of a merger-built classical bulge. This challenges our\npicture of galaxy formation by hierarchical clustering, because it is difficult\nto grow big galaxies without also making a big classical bulge. Solving the\npuzzle of the \"missing pseudobulge\" in NGC 4565 further increases our\nconfidence that we understand box-shaped bulges correctly as edge-on bars.

This\nbroadening is due to the fact that any change of the occupation of the d-state\nin one spin band changes the eigenstates in the opposite spin band and causes\ntransitions in both spin bands. This broadening reduces the height of the\nresonance curve and therefore the density of states by a factor of two.

In this paper\nwe re-calculate the intensity and morphology of the WMAP haze using a\nmulti-linear regression involving full-sky templates of the dominant forms of\ngalactic foreground emission, using two different CMB sky signal estimators.\nThe first estimator is a posterior mean CMB map, marginalized over a general\nforeground model using a Gibbs sampling technique, and the other is the ILC map\nproduced by the WMAP team. Earlier analyses of the WMAP haze used the ILC map,\nwhich is more contaminated by galactic foregrounds than the Gibbs map. In\neither case, we re-confirm earlier results that a statistically significant\nresidual emission remains after foreground subtraction that is concentrated\naround the galactic centre. However, we find that the significance of this\nemission can be significantly reduced by allowing for a subtle spatial\nvariation in the frequency dependence of soft synchrotron emission in the inner\nand outer parts of the galaxy. We also re-investigate the prospect of a\nneutralino dark matter interpretation of the origin of the haze, and find that\nsignificant boosting in the dark matter annihilation rate is required, relative\nto that obtained with a smooth galactic dark matter distribution, in order to\nreproduce the inferred residual emission, contrary to that deduced in several\nrecent studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Jan 2009 02:37:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-03"}

It is shown\nthat the influence to the transmission comes from three parts: the\ngroove-generated surface plasmon wave (SPW), the nano-slit-generated SPW and\nthe incident wave. The groove-generated SPW is the main factor determining the\nlocal field distribution around the nano-slit opening, which is directly\nrelated to the transmission through the nano-slit. The nano-slit-generated SPW\ncan be considered as a disturbance to the light distribution on the input\nsurface. The influence of the incident wave can be strongly reduced when strong\nsurface plasmon wave is generated on the input surface by many periods of deep\ngrooves. Our study shows that the slit-to-groove distance for a maximal\ntransmission through the nano-slit surrounded with periodic grooves can not be\npredicted by several previous theories, including the magnetic field phase\ntheory of a recent work (Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 043902, 2007). A clear physical\nexplanation is given for the dependence of the transmission on the\nslit-to-groove distance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Jan 2009 10:52:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

These cover the emission lines of H$\\alpha$,\n[NII], [SII], and [SIII]. We were able to accurately decompose the emission\nline profiles into multiple narrow components (FWHM~30-130kms) superimposed on\na broad (FWHM 150-350kms) feature. This paper is the first of a series\nexamining the optical structure of M82's disk and inner wind; here we focus on\nthe ionized gaseous and stellar dynamics and present maps of the relevant\nemission line properties.\n  Our observations show that ionized gas in the starburst core of M82 is\ndynamically complex. Localised line splitting of up to 100kms in the narrow\ncomponent is associated with expanding shells of compressed, cool, photoionized\ngas. We have been able to associate some of this inner-wind gas with a distinct\noutflow channel characterised by its dynamics and gas density patterns, and we\ndiscuss the consequences of this discovery in terms of the developing wind\noutflow.\n  The broad optical emission line component is observed to become increasingly\nimportant moving outward along the outflow channel, and in general with\nincreasing height above/below the plane. Following our recent work on the\norigins of this component, we associate it with turbulent gas in wind-clump\ninterface layers and hence sites of mass loading, meaning that the turbulent\nmixing of cooler gas into the outflowing hot gas must become increasingly\nimportant with height, and provides powerful direct evidence for the existence\nof mass-loading over a large, spatially extended area.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Jan 2009 12:58:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

Cao and\nTiti (2005, 2007) have provided a new impetus to this by proving existence and\nuniqueness of solutions of viscous HPE on a cylinder with Neumann-like boundary\nconditions on the top and bottom. In contrast, the regularity of solutions of\nNPE remains an open question. With this HPE regularity result in mind, the\nsecond issue examined in this paper is whether extreme events are allowed to\narise spontaneously in their solutions. Such events could include, for example,\nthe sudden appearance and disappearance of locally intense fronts that do not\ninvolve deep convection. Analytical methods are used to show that for viscous\nHPE, the creation of small-scale structures is allowed locally in space and\ntime at sizes that scale inversely with the Reynolds number.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Jan 2009 13:18:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2009 00:09:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 1 May 2010 20:45:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-04"}
