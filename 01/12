However, it remains a\nnon-trivial task to construct physically meaningful states on the algebra. For\ninstance, we are in the unsatisfactory situation that there exist no examples\nof states suited to describe local thermal equilibrium in a non-stationary\nspacetime. In this thesis, we construct a class of states for the Klein-Gordon\nfield in Robertson-Walker spacetimes, which seem to provide the first example\nof thermal states in a spacetime without time translation symmetry. More\nprecisely, in the setting of real, linear, scalar fields in Robertson-Walker\nspacetimes we define on the set of homogeneous, isotropic, quasi-free states a\nfree energy functional that is based on the averaged energy density measured by\nan isotropic observer along his worldline. This functional is well defined and\nlower bounded by a suitable quantum energy inequality. Subsequently, we\nminimize this functional and obtain states that we interpret as 'almost\nequilibrium states'. It turns out that the states of low energy, which were\nrecently introduced by Olbermann, are the ground states of the almost\nequilibrium states. Finally, we prove that the almost equilibrium states\nsatisfy the Hadamard condition, which qualifies them as physically meaningful\nstates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Jan 2009 18:29:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-13"}

It has been widely\nperceived that the most promising approach to address these two challenges are\nelectro nanomechanical systems. Here we approach for the first time the quantum\nregime with a mechanical oscillator of mesoscopic dimensions--discernible to\nthe bare eye--and 1000-times more massive than the heaviest nano-mechanical\noscillators used to date. Imperative to these advances are two key principles\nof cavity optomechanics: Optical interferometric measurement of mechanical\ndisplacement at the attometer level, and the ability to use measurement induced\ndynamic back-action to achieve resolved sideband laser cooling of the\nmechanical degree of freedom. Using only modest cryogenic pre-cooling to 1.65\nK, preparation of a mechanical oscillator close to its quantum ground state\n(63+-20 phonons) is demonstrated. Simultaneously, a readout sensitivity that is\nwithin a factor of 5.5+-1.5 of the standard quantum limit is achieved.

The proofs of these homogenization results\nare based on a new class of elliptic inequalities which play the same role in\nour approach as the div-curl lemma in classical homogenization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Jan 2009 20:12:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Feb 2009 04:10:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 13 Mar 2009 21:32:42 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2009 13:11:55 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2009 19:40:31 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2009 14:49:50 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2010 18:58:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The novel topology leads to a\nspatially varying filling factor along the current path. The resulting\ninhomogeneous current-density distribution gives rise to additional features in\nthe magneto-transport, such as resistance asymmetry and modified longitudinal\nresistances. We experimentally demonstrate that the asymmetry relations\nsatisfied in the integer filling factor regime are valid also in the transition\nregime to non-integer filling factors, thereby suggesting a more general form\nof these asymmetry relations. A model is developed based on the screening\ntheory of the integer quantum Hall effect that allows the self-consistent\ncalculation of the local electron density and thereby the local current density\nincluding the current along incompressible stripes. The model, which also\nincludes the so-called `static skin effect' to account for the current density\ndistribution in the compressible regions, is capable of explaining the main\nexperimental observations. Due to the existence of an\nincompressible-compressible transition in the bulk, the system behaves always\nmetal-like in contrast to the conventional Landauer-Buettiker description, in\nwhich the bulk remains completely insulating throughout the quantized Hall\nplateau regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jan 2009 00:48:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-01"}

In comparison with previous\nstudies, the present one takes advantage of deep 70 um observations that\nprovide a more robust infrared luminosity indicator than 24 um affected by the\nemission of PAHs at high redshift (z~1), and we use several independent fields\nto control cosmic variance. We use a new extraction technique based on the\nwell-determined positions of galaxies at shorter wavelengths to extract the 24\nand 70 um flux densities of galaxies. Using a combination of photometric and\nspectroscopic redshifts that exist for ~80% of the sources in our sample, we\nare able to estimate the rest-frame luminosities of galaxies at 15um and 35um.\nThen using a careful stacking analysis to validate the infrared bolometric\ncorrections we compute the infrared luminosity function in three redshift bins\nz~0.55, z~0.85, and z~1.15. We find that the average infrared spectral energy\ndistribution of galaxies over the last 2/3 of the cosmic time is consistent\nwith that of local galaxies, although individual sources do present significant\nscatter. We also measured both the bright and faint ends of the infrared\nluminosity functions and find no evidence for a change in the slope of the\ndouble power law used to characterize the luminosity function. The redshift\nevolution of infrared luminous galaxies is consistent with pure luminosity\nevolution proportional to (1+z)^3.6 up to z~1.3.

In this paper, we present a new statistical analysis of the\nobserved EPs, focusing on the origin of the HPs. Among the several HP formation\nmechanisms proposed so far, the two main formation mechanisms are type II\nmigration and scattering. In both cases, planets form beyond the so-called\nsnow-line of the protoplanetary disk and then migrate inward due to angular\nmomentum and energy exchange with either the protoplanetary disk or with\ncompanion planets. Although theoretical studies produce a range of observed\nfeatures, no firm correspondence between the observed EPs and models has yet\nbeen established. In our analysis, by means of principal component analysis and\nhierarchical cluster analysis, we find convincing indications for the existence\nof two types of HPs, whose parameters reflect physical mechanisms of type II\nmigration and scattering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jan 2009 10:58:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The latter provides a unified description\nof different lattice structures with curvature, which is always localized at\nsix heptagonal carbon rings around each junction. When these are evenly spaced,\nwe find that it is possible to curve the planar lattice into armchair (6n,6n)\nas well as zig-zag (6n,0) nanotubes. We show that the junctions fall into two\ndifferent classes, regarding the low-energy electronic behavior. One of them,\nconstituted by the junctions made of the armchair nanotubes and the zig-zag\n(6n,0) geometries when n is a multiple of 3, is characterized by the presence\nof two quasi-bound states at the Fermi level, which are absent for the rest of\nthe zig-zag nanotubes. These states, localized at the junction, are shown to\narise from the effective gauge flux induced by the heptagonal carbon rings,\nwhich has a direct reflection in the local density of states around the\njunction. Furthermore, we also analyze the band structure of the arrays of\njunctions, finding out that they can also be classified into two different\ngroups according to the low-energy behavior. In this regard, the arrays made of\narmchair and (6n,0) nanotubes with n equal to a multiple of 3 are characterized\nby the presence of a series of flat bands, whose number grows with the length\nof the nanotubes. We show that such flat bands have their origin in the\nformation of states confined to the nanotubes in the array.

For the latter task we also use the results of measurements from the\nprevious missions to Venus. Our main result is that the changing character of\nphysical interactions between the solar wind and the planetary obstacle is\nleading to different types of spectral scaling in the near-Venusian space.\nNoisy fluctuations are observed in the magnetosheath, wavy structures near the\nterminator and in the nightside near-planet wake. Multi-scale turbulence is\nobserved at the magnetosheath boundary layer and near the quasi-parallel bow\nshock. Magnetosheath boundary layer turbulence is associated with an average\nmagnetic field which is nearly aligned with the Sun-Venus line. Noisy magnetic\nfluctuations are well described with the Gaussian statistics. Both\nmagnetosheath boundary layer and near shock turbulence statistics exhibit\nnon-Gaussian features and intermittency over small spatio-temporal scales. The\noccurrence of turbulence near magnetosheath boundaries can be responsible for\nthe local heating of plasma observed by previous missions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jan 2009 13:25:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-23"}

In the archipelago of the\nAzores, four species of dolphins are commonly involved in mixed-species\nassociations: the common dolphin, Delphinus delphis, the bottlenose dolphin,\nTursiops truncatus, the striped dolphin, Stenella coeruleoalba, and the spotted\ndolphin, Stenella frontalis. In order to understand the reasons why dolphins\nassociate, we analysed field data collected since 1999 by research scientists\nand trained observers placed onboard fishing vessels. In total, 113\nmixed-species groups were observed out of 5720 sightings. The temporal\ndistribution, habitat (water depth, distance to the coast), behaviour (i.e.\nfeeding, travelling, socializing), size and composition of mixed-species groups\nwere compared with those of single-species groups.

However,\nthe benefits of mixed-species associations appeared to depend on the species.\nAssociations were likely to be opportunistic in the larger bottlenose dolphin,\nwhile there seemed to be some evolutionary constraints favouring associations\nin the rarer striped dolphin.

We are motivated by the problem of constructing sets\nof trees which must fit into a recombination, hybridization, or similar\nnetwork. Rather than first finding a set of trees which are optimal according\nto a phylogenetic criterion (e.g. likelihood or parsimony) and then attempting\nto fit them into a network, constNJ estimates the trees while enforcing\nspecified rSPR distance constraints. The primary input for constNJ is a\ncollection of distance matrices derived from sequence blocks which are assumed\nto have evolved in a tree-like manner, such as blocks of an alignment which do\nnot contain any recombination breakpoints. The other input is a set of rSPR\nconstraints for any set of pairs of trees. ConstNJ is consistent and a strict\ngeneralization of the neighbor-joining algorithm; it uses the new notion of\n\"maximum agreement partitions\" to assure that the resulting trees satisfy the\ngiven rSPR distance constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jan 2009 15:46:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Jan 2009 19:41:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-30"}

We combine maps of the\nmolecular gas using 12CO 2--1 map HERA/IRAM-30m data and HI VLA data to study\nthe total gas surface density and the phase transition of atomic to molecular\ngas. The total gas surface density is compared to the dust surface density from\n850 micron SCUBA data. Taking into account the velocity dispersions of the\nmolecular and atomic gas, and the stellar surface densities derived from the\n2MASS K-band survey, we derive the total Toomre Q parameter of the disk. The\ngas surface density in the spiral arms is approximately 2-3 higher compared to\nthat of the interarm regions. The ratio of molecular to atomic surface density\nshows a nearly power-law dependence on the hydrostatic pressure P_hydro. The\ngas surface density distribution in M51 shows an underlying exponential\ndistribution with a scale length of h_gas=7.6 kpc representing 55% of the total\ngas mass, comparable to the properties of the exponential dust disk. In\ncontrast to the velocity widths observed in HI, the CO velocity dispersion\nshows enhanced line widths in the spiral arms compared to the interarm regions.\nThe contribution of the stellar component in the Toomre Q-parameter analysis is\nsignificant and lowers the combined Q-parameter Q_tot by up to 70% towards the\nthreshold for gravitational instability.
