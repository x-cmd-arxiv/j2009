When both the users employ the\nsame code alphabet, it is well known that an appropriate rotation between the\nalphabets provides unique decodability to the receiver. For such a set-up, a\nmetric is proposed to compute the angle(s) of rotation between the alphabets\nsuch that the CC capacity region is maximally enlarged. Subsequently, code\npairs based on Trellis Coded Modulation (TCM) are designed for the two-user\nGMAC with $M$-PSK and $M$-PAM alphabet pairs for arbitrary values of $M$ and it\nis proved that, for certain angles of rotation, Ungerboeck labelling on the\ntrellis of each user maximizes the guaranteed squared Euclidean distance of the\n\\textit{sum trellis}. Hence, such a labelling scheme can be used systematically\nto construct trellis code pairs for a two-user GMAC to achieve sum rates close\nto the sum capacity of the channel. More importantly, it is shown for the first\ntime that ML decoding complexity at the destination is significantly reduced\nwhen $M$-PAM alphabet pairs are employed with \\textit{almost} no loss in the\nsum capacity. \\indent A two-user Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) fading\nMAC with $N_{t}$ antennas at both the users and a single antenna at the\ndestination has also been considered with the assumption that the destination\nhas the perfect knowledge of channel state information and the two users have\nthe perfect knowledge of only the phase components of their channels.

Specifically, the utility of an agent is the sum of its utilities for\nitems it receives, and we seek to maximize the minimum utility of any agent.\nWhile this problem has received much attention recently, its approximability\nhas not been well-understood thus far: the best known approximation algorithm\nachieves an $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{m})$-approximation, and in contrast, the best\nknown hardness of approximation stands at 2.\n  Our main result is an approximation algorithm that achieves an\n$\\tilde{O}(n^{\\eps})$ approximation for any $\\eps=\\Omega(\\log\\log n/\\log n)$ in\ntime $n^{O(1/\\eps)}$. In particular, we obtain poly-logarithmic approximation\nin quasi-polynomial time, and for any constant $\\eps > 0$, we obtain\n$O(n^{\\eps})$ approximation in polynomial time. An interesting aspect of our\nalgorithm is that we use as a building block a linear program whose integrality\ngap is $\\Omega(\\sqrt m)$. We bypass this obstacle by iteratively using the\nsolutions produced by the LP to construct new instances with significantly\nsmaller integrality gaps, eventually obtaining the desired approximation.\n  We also investigate the special case of the problem, where every item has a\nnon-zero utility for at most two agents. We show that even in this restricted\nsetting the problem is hard to approximate upto any factor better tha 2, and\nshow a factor $(2+\\eps)$-approximation algorithm running in time\n$poly(n,1/\\eps)$ for any $\\eps>0$. This special case can be cast as a graph\nedge orientation problem, and our algorithm can be viewed as a generalization\nof Eulerian orientations to weighted graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jan 2009 01:24:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-05"}

A particle enters the\ninterior region of an Einstein-Rosen black hole which is regular and physically\nequivalent to the asymptotically flat exterior of a white hole, and the\nparticle's proper time extends to infinity. Because the motion across the\nEinstein-Rosen bridge is unidirectional, and the surface of a black hole is the\nevent horizon for distant observers, an Einstein-Rosen black hole is\nindistinguishable from a Schwarzschild black hole for such observers. Observers\ninside an Einstein-Rosen black hole perceive its interior as a closed universe\nthat began when the black hole formed, with an initial radius equal to the\nSchwarzschild radius of the black hole $r_g$, and with an initial accelerated\nexpansion. Therefore the model of a universe as a black hole in isotropic\ncoordinates explains the origin of cosmic inflation. We show that this kind of\ninflation corresponds to the effective cosmological constant $\\Lambda=3/r_g^2$,\nwhich, for the smallest astrophysical black holes, is $~10^{-8}m^{-2}$. If we\nassume that our Universe is the interior of an Einstein-Rosen black hole,\nastronomical observations give the time of inflation $~10^{-3}s$ and the size\nof the Universe at the end of the inflationary epoch $~10^{32}m$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jan 2009 06:01:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-21"}

Earlier network models typically assumed that\ntopological transformations are caused by exogenous factors, such as\npreferential attachment of new nodes and stochastic or targeted removal of\nexisting nodes. However, many real-world complex systems exhibit both of these\ntwo dynamics simultaneously, and they evolve largely autonomously based on the\nsystem's own states and topologies.

We show that each connected\nsequential topological space X is the image of a nonseparably connected\ncomplete metric space Eco(X) under a monotone quotient map. The metric d of the\nspace Eco(X) is economical in the sense that for each infinite subspace A of X\nthe cardinality of the set {d(a,b):a,b in A} does not exceed the density of A.\nThe construction of the space Eco(X) determines a functor Eco from the category\nTop of topological spaces and their continuous maps into the category Metr of\nmetric spaces and their non-expanding maps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jan 2009 12:09:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Jan 2009 20:21:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 1 Nov 2009 19:25:11 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 7 Nov 2009 09:03:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-11"}

Therefore, we conjecture that this resonant effect is a\ncharacteristic for the eavesdropping strategy near to optimal one.

We argue that the\nlinear in $T$ term appears due to non-analytic temperature dependence of\n$\\chi(T)$ in a two-dimensional Fermi liquid. We show that the prefactor of the\n$T$ term is expressed via the square of the spin-density-wave (SDW) amplitude\nconnecting nested hole and electron pockets. Due to an incipient SDW\ninstability, this amplitude is large, which, along with a small value of the\nFermi energy, makes the $T$ dependence of $\\chi(T)$ strong. We demonstrate that\nthis mechanism is in quantitative agreement with the experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jan 2009 13:34:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-12"}

It utilises the effect that the\nenergy deposit of the particle cascade evolving from a neutrino interaction in\nwater generates a coherently emitted sound wave with frequency components in\nthe range between about 1 and 50 kHz. The AMADEUS (Antares Modules for Acoustic\nDEtection Under the Sea) project is integrated into the ANTARES neutrino\ntelescope and aims at the investigation of techniques for acoustic particle\ndetection in sea water. The acoustic sensors of AMADEUS are using piezo\nelements and are recording a broad-band signal with frequencies ranging up to\n125 kHz. After an introduction to acoustic neutrino detection it will be shown\nhow an acoustic array similar to AMADEUS can be used for positioning as well as\nacoustic particle detection.

A natural extension of a\ncausal set is an enumeration of its elements which respects the order. We bring\ntogether two different classes of random processes. In one class, we are given\na fixed causal set, and we consider random natural extensions of this causal\nset: we think of the random enumeration as being generated one point at a time.\nIn the other class of processes, we generate a random causal set, working from\nthe bottom up, adding one new maximal element at each stage. Processes of both\ntypes can exhibit a property called order-invariance: if we stop the process\nafter some fixed number of steps, then, conditioned on the structure of the\ncausal set, every possible order of generation of its elements is equally\nlikely. We develop a framework for the study of order-invariance which includes\nboth types of example: order-invariance is then a property of probability\nmeasures on a certain space.
