Theory suggests that some\nmassive stars (initially greater than 25-30 solar masses) end up as Wolf-Rayet\nstars which are deficient in hydrogen because of mass loss through strong\nstellar winds. The most massive of these stars have cores which may form a\nblack hole and theory predicts that the resulting explosion produces ejecta of\nlow kinetic energy, a faint optical display and a small mass fraction of\nradioactive nickel(1,2,3). An alternative origin for low energy supernovae is\nthe collapse of the oxygen-neon core of a relatively lowmass star (7-9 solar\nmasses) through electron capture(4,5).

Such problems\ncharacterize many important applications including detection and classification\nof targets in a geographical area using a network of sensors, and detecting\ncomplex substances with a chemical sensor array. We refer to such applications\nas largescale detection problems. Using the insight that these problems share\nfundamental similarities with the problem of communicating over a noisy\nchannel, we define a quantity called the sensing capacity and lower bound it\nfor a number of sensor network models. The sensing capacity expression differs\nsignificantly from the channel capacity due to the fact that a fixed sensor\nconfiguration encodes all states of the environment. As a result, codewords are\ndependent and non-identically distributed. The sensing capacity provides a\nbound on the minimal number of sensors required to detect the state of an\nenvironment to within a desired accuracy. The results differ significantly from\nclassical detection theory, and provide an ntriguing connection between sensor\nnetworks and communications. In addition, we discuss the insight that sensing\ncapacity provides for the problem of sensor selection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jan 2009 19:17:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

The dominant spectral features are emission lines from\nmoderately ionized species of argon, neon, and sulphur, which are used to\ndetermine the physical conditions in the ionized gas. The ionized gas\nexcitation shows strong variations on parsec scales, some of which can\nplausibly be associated with individual hot stars. We fit the ionic line\nstrengths with photoionization and shock models, and find that photoionization\ndominates in the region. The ionization parameter U traces the rim of the\ncentral bubble, as well as highlighting isolated sources of ionization, and at\nleast one quiescent clump. The hardness of the ionizing radiation field T_rad\nreveals several \"hot spots\" that are either the result of individual very hot\nstars or trace the propagation of the diffuse ionizing field through the\nsurrounding neutral cloud.

It turns out that a mode of $\\delta F = (h-f/e)$ is merely a redundant\nfield of dilaton $\\varphi$ in the absence of Chern-Simons terms, while it\nbecomes a massive scalar in the presence of Chern-Simons terms. This shows\nclearly that the proper number of physically propagating degrees of freedom is\none for the topologically massive gravity. Moreover, at the points of\n$K=l,l/3$, $\\delta F$ becomes a massless scalar which implies that there is no\nphysically propagating degrees of freedom at the chiral point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jan 2009 05:41:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 30 May 2009 10:13:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-19"}

In both optical and X-ray images\nMACSJ1206 appears close to relaxed in projection, with a pronounced X-ray peak\nat the location of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG); we interpret this\nfeature as the remnant of a cold core. A spectacular giant gravitational arc,\n15\" in length, bright (V~21) and unusually red (R-K=4.3), is seen 20\" west of\nthe BCG; we measure a redshift of z=1.036 for the lensed galaxy. From our HST\nimage of the cluster we identify the giant arc and its counter image as a\nseven-fold imaged system. An excess of X-ray emission in the direction of the\narc coincides with a mild galaxy overdensity and could be the remnant of a\nminor merger with a group of galaxies. We derive estimates of the total cluster\nmass as well as of the mass of the cluster core using X-ray, dynamical, and\ngravitational-lensing techniques. For the mass enclosed by the giant arc (r<119\nkpc) our strong-lensing analysis based on HST imaging yields a very high value\nof 1.1 x 10^14 M_sun, inconsistent with the much lower X-ray estimate of 0.5 x\n10^14 M_sun.

The resonant\nscattering leads to the photon distribution in the frequency space to be\npiecewise smooth containing sharp changes.

Unlike the conventional iterative water-filling\n(IWF) algorithm that applies the single-user detection (SD) at each user's\nreceiver by treating the interference from the other user as additional noise,\nthe proposed ISS algorithm applies multiuser detection techniques to decode\nboth the desired user's and interference user's messages if it is feasible,\nthus termed as opportunistic multiuser detection (OMD). Two encoding methods\nare considered for ISS: One is carrier independent encoding where independent\ncodewords are modulated by different subcarriers for which different decoding\nmethods can be applied; the other is carrier joint encoding where a single\ncodeword is modulated by all the subcarriers for which a single decoder is\napplied. For each encoding method, this paper presents the associated optimal\nuser power and rate allocation strategy at each iteration of transmit\nadaptation.

Measurements have\ncontinued with only a few brief interruptions since that time. We give here the\nexperimental improvements in SAGE since its last published data summary in Dec.\n2001. Assuming the solar neutrino production rate was constant during the\nperiod of data collection, combined analysis of 168 extractions through Dec.\n2007 gives a capture rate of solar neutrinos with energy more than 233 keV of\n65.4 (+3.1)(-3.0) (stat) (+2.6)(-2.8) (syst) SNU. The weighted average of the\nresults of all three Ga solar neutrino experiments, SAGE, Gallex, and GNO, is\nnow 66.1 +/- 3.1 SNU, where statistical and systematic uncertainties have been\ncombined in quadrature. During the recent period of data collection a new test\nof SAGE was made with a reactor-produced 37Ar neutrino source. The ratio of\nobserved to calculated rates in this experiment, combined with the measured\nrates in the three prior 51Cr neutrino-source experiments with Ga, is 0.87 +/-\n0.05. A probable explanation for this low result is that the cross section for\nneutrino capture by the two lowest-lying excited states in 71Ge has been\noverestimated.

The precise mechanism of this\nforeign-self-distinction, though one of the major tasks of the immune system,\ncontinues to be a fundamental puzzle. Recent progress has been made by van den\nBerg, Rand, and Burroughs (2001), who modelled the \\emph{probabilistic} nature\nof the interaction between the relevant cell types, namely, T-cells and\nantigen-presenting cells (APCs). Here, the stochasticity is due to the random\nsample of antigens present on the surface of every APC, and to the random\nreceptor type that characterises individual T-cells. It has been shown\npreviously that this model, though highly idealised, is capable of reproducing\nimportant aspects of the recognition phenomenon, and of explaining them on the\nbasis of stochastic rare events. These results were obtained with the help of a\nrefined large deviation theorem and were thus asymptotic in nature. Simulations\nhave, so far, been restricted to the straightforward simple sampling approach,\nwhich does not allow for sample sizes large enough to address more detailed\nquestions. Building on the available large deviation results, we develop an\nimportance sampling technique that allows for a convenient exploration of the\nrelevant tail events by means of simulation. With its help, we investigate the\nmechanism of statistical recognition in some depth. In particular, we\nillustrate how a foreign antigen can stand out against the self background if\nit is present in sufficiently many copies, although no \\emph{a priori}\ndifference between self and nonself is built into the model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jan 2009 10:52:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-30"}

Quantum corrections of the action for both cases are found to be\nproportional to the semiclassical contribution. Modifications to the Hawking\ntemperature and Bekenstein-Hawking area law are thereby obtained. Using this\ncorrected temperature and Hawking's periodicity argument, the modified metric\nfor the Schwarzschild black hole is given. This corrected version of the\nmetric, upto $\\hbar$ order is equivalent to the metric obtained by including\none loop back reaction effect. Finally, the coefficient of the leading order\ncorrection of entropy is shown to be related to the trace anomaly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jan 2009 13:17:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2010 05:31:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-06"}

The main characteristic of\nholographic Ricci dark energy is governed by a positive numerical parameter\n$\\alpha$ in the model. When $\\alpha<1/2$, the holographic Ricci dark energy\nwill exhibit a quintomlike behavior; i.e., its equation of state will evolve\nacross the cosmological-constant boundary $w=-1$. The parameter $\\alpha$ can be\ndetermined only by observations. Thus, in order to characterize the evolving\nfeature of dark energy and to predict the fate of the universe, it is of\nextraordinary importance to constrain the parameter $\\alpha$ by using the\nobservational data. In this paper, we derive constraints on the holographic\nRicci dark energy model from the latest observational data including the Union\nsample of 307 type Ia supernovae, the shift parameter of the cosmic microwave\nbackground given by the five-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe\nobservations, and the baryon acoustic oscillation measurement from the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey.

For low mass\nprotoplanets and large viscosity the corotation torque behaves as expected from\nlinear theory. However, when the viscosity becomes small enough to enable\nhorseshoe turns to occur, the linear corotation torque exists only temporarily\nafter insertion of a planet into the disc, being replaced by the horseshoe drag\nfirst discussed by Ward. This happens after a time that is equal to the\nhorseshoe libration period reduced by a factor amounting to about twice the\ndisc aspect ratio. This torque scales with the radial gradient of specific\nvorticity, as does the linear torque, but we find it to be many times larger.\nIf the viscosity is large enough for viscous diffusion across the coorbital\nregion to occur within a libration period, we find that the horseshoe drag may\nbe sustained.

With the development of modern\ntechnologies it is possible to obtain datacubes in which one combines both\ntechniques simultaneously, producing images with spectral resolution. To\nextract information from them can be quite complex, and hence the development\nof new methods of data analysis is desirable. We present a method of analysis\nof datacube (data from single field observations, containing two spatial and\none spectral dimension) that uses PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to express\nthe data in the form of reduced dimensionality, facilitating efficient\ninformation extraction from very large data sets. PCA transforms the system of\ncorrelated coordinates into a system of uncorrelated coordinates ordered by\nprincipal components of decreasing variance. The new coordinates are referred\nto as eigenvectors, and the projections of the data onto these coordinates\nproduce images we will call tomograms. The association of the tomograms\n(images) to eigenvectors (spectra) is important for the interpretation of both.\nThe eigenvectors are mutually orthogonal and this information is fundamental\nfor their handling and interpretation. When the datacube shows objects that\npresent uncorrelated physical phenomena, the eigenvector's orthogonality may be\ninstrumental in separating and identifying them. By handling eigenvectors and\ntomograms one can enhance features, extract noise, compress data, extract\nspectra, etc. We applied the method, for illustration purpose only, to the\ncentral region of the LINER galaxy NGC 4736, and demonstrate that it has a type\n1 active nucleus, not known before.

An I-GARCH(2) process\n(2 time scales, similar to GARCH(1,1)) is better, while a long memory LM-ARCH\nprocess (multiple time scales) replicates correctly the dynamic of the realized\nvolatility and delivers consistently good forecast for the implied volatility.\nThe relationship between market models for the forward variance and the\nvolatility forecasts provided by ARCH processes is investigated. The structure\nof the forecast equations is identical, but with different coefficients. Yet\nthe process equations for the variance are very different (postulated for a\nmarket model, induced by the process equations for an ARCH model), and not of\nany usual diffusive type when derived from ARCH.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jan 2009 14:40:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-16"}

These\ncomplex cloud structures lead to intricate emission line shapes. The goal of\nthis paper is to show that the complex line shapes of 12 CO lines in NGC 2024\ncan be explained consistently with a model, whose temperature and velocity\nstructure are based on the well-established scenario of a PDR and the Blister\nmodel. We present velocity-resolved spectra of seven CO lines ranging from J=3\nto J=13, and we combined these data with CO high-frequency data from the ISO\nsatellite. We find that the bulk of the molecular cloud associated with NGC\n2024 consists of warm (75 K) and dense (9e5 cm-3) gas. An additional hot (~ 300\nK) component, located at the interface of the HII region and the molecular\ncloud, is needed to explain the emission of the high-J CO lines. Deep\nabsorption notches indicate that very cold material (20 K) exists in front of\nthe warm material, too. A temperature and column density structure consistent\nwith those predicted by PDR models, combined with the velocity structure of a\nBlister model, appropriately describes the observed emission line profiles of\nthis massive star forming region. This case study of NGC 2024 shows that, with\nphysical insights into these complex regions and careful modeling, multi-line\nobservations of CO can be used to derive detailed physical conditions in\nmassive star forming regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jan 2009 14:47:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
