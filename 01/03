Beyond the\ncrossover from narrow to broad IPR statistics, which always occurs for\nsufficiently large moments of the wavefunction amplitude, the spectrum obtained\nfrom a typical wavefunction associated with a particular disorder realization\ndiffers markedly from that obtained from the disorder-averaged IPRs.

However, the directed flow from origins to destinations\nwas induced via a potential function that was heuristic. Here, with a\ntheoretically sound approach called the channel mode, we extend our earlier\nwork for directed information flow. This is achieved by constructing a\npotential function facilitating a purely probabilistic interpretation of the\nchannel mode. For each network node, the channel mode combines the solutions of\nemitting and absorbing modes in the same context, producing what we call a\nchannel tensor. The entries of the channel tensor at each node can be\ninterpreted as the amount of flow passing through that node from an origin to a\ndestination. Similarly to our earlier model, the channel mode encompasses\ndamping as a free parameter that controls the locality of information flow.\nThrough examples involving the yeast pheromone response pathway, we illustrate\nthe versatility and stability of our new framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jan 2009 21:45:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2010 00:11:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2011 23:04:35 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 19 Apr 2012 16:15:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-20"}

If a\nstar enters the LC then, depending on its properties, its interaction with the\nMBH will either generate a luminous electromagnetic flare or give rise to\ngravitational radiation, both of which are expected to have directly observable\nconsequences. A thorough understanding of loss-cone refilling mechanisms is\nimportant for the prediction of astrophysical quantities, such as rates of\ntidal disrupting main-sequence stars, rates of capturing compact stellar\nremnants and timescales of merging binary MBHs. In this thesis, we use N-body\nsimulations to investigate how noise from accreted satellites and other\nsubstructures in a galaxy's halo can affect the LC refilling rate.\n  Any N-body model suffers from Poisson noise which is similar to, but much\nstronger than, the two-body diffusion occurring in real galaxies. To lessen\nthis spurious Poisson noise, we apply the idea of importance sampling to\ndevelop a new scheme for constructing N-body realizations of a galaxy model, in\nwhich interesting regions of phase-space are sampled by many low-mass\nparticles. We use multimass N-body models of galaxies with centrally-embedded\nMBHs to study the effects of satellite flybys on LC refilling rates. We find\nthat although the flux of stars into the initially emptied LC is enhanced, but\nthe fuelling rate averaged over the entire subhalos is increased by only a\nfactor 3 over the rate one expects from the Poisson noise due the discreteness\nof the stellar distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Jan 2009 02:24:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-21"}

In this work we\ninvestigate its flux variability and study the intermediate long and short\nbursts discovered by Swift on July 17, and 27, 2008, respectively. So far, only\none intermediate long burst, with a duration of ~18 minutes and ten days later\na short burst, have been recorded from XTE J1701-407. We analyzed the public\navailable data from Swift and RXTE, and compared the observed properties of the\nintermediate long burst with theoretical ignition condition and light curves to\ninvestigate the possible nuclear burning processes. The intermediate long burst\nmay have exhibited a photospheric radius expansion, allowing us to derive the\nsource distance at 6.2 kpc assuming the empirically derived Eddington\nluminosity for pure helium. The intermediate long burst decay was best fit by\nusing two exponential functions with e-folding times of \\tau_1=40(3) s and\n\\tau_2=221(9) s. The bursts occurred at a persistent luminosity of\nL_{per}=8.3x10E36 erg/s. For the intermediate long burst the mass accretion\nrate per unit area onto the NS was \\dot{m}=4x10E3 g/cm2/s, and the total energy\nreleased was E_{burst}=3.5x10E40 erg. This corresponds to an ignition column\ndepth of y_{ign}=1.8x10E9 g/cm2, for a pure helium burning. We find that the\nenergetics of this burst can be modeled in different ways, as (i) pure helium\nignition, as the result of either pure helium accretion or depletion of\nhydrogen by steady burning during accumulation, or (ii) as ignition of a thick\nlayer of hydrogen-rich material in a source with low metallicity. However,\ncomparison of the burst duration with model light curves suggests that hydrogen\nburning plays a role during the burst, and therefore this source is a low\naccretion rate burster with a low metallicity in the accreted material.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Jan 2009 10:55:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

AMADEUS\nconsists of six clusters, each one comprising six acoustic sensors that are\narranged at distances of roughly 1m from each other. Three acoustic clusters\nare installed along a vertical mechanical structure (a so-called Line) of\nANTARES with spacings of about 15m and 110m, respectively.

AMADEUS thus allows\nfor extensive acoustic background studies including signal correlations on\nseveral length scales as well as source localisation.
