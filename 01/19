However, the reads generated by pyrosequencing are short in\nsize and contain numerous errors. Furthermore, each read has a specific\nposition in the reference genome.

Existing multiple sequence\nalignment methods cannot be used as they do not take into account the specific\npositions of the sequences with respect to the genome, and are highly\ninefficient for large number of sequences. Therefore, the common practice has\nbeen to use either simple pairwise alignment despite its poor accuracy for\nerror prone pyroreads, or use computationally expensive techniques based on\nsequential gap propagation. In this paper, we develop a computationally\nefficient method based on domain decomposition, referred to as pyro-align, to\nalign such large number of reads.

However, with limited feedback\nprecoding, V-BLAST achieves FD, but with some rate loss. Our contribution in\nthis paper is two-fold: $i)$ we propose a limited feedback (LFB) precoding\nscheme which achieves FRFD in $2\\times 2$, $3\\times 3$ and $4\\times 4$ V-BLAST\nsystems (we refer to this scheme as FRFD-VBLAST-LFB scheme), and $ii)$\ncomparing the performances of the FRFD-VBLAST-LFB scheme and non-orthogonal\nSTBCs without feedback (e.g., Golden code, perfect codes) under ML decoding, we\nshow that in $2\\times 2$ MIMO system with 4-QAM/16-QAM, FRFD-VBLAST-LFB scheme\noutperforms the Golden code by about 0.6 dB; in $3\\times 3$ and $4\\times 4$\nMIMO systems, the performance of FRFD-VBLAST-LFB scheme is comparable to the\nperformance of perfect codes. The FRFD-VBLAST-LFB scheme is attractive because\n1) ML decoding becomes less complex compared to that of non-orthogonal STBCs,\n2) the number of feedback bits required to achieve the above performance is\nsmall, 3) in slow-fading, it is adequate to send feedback bits only\noccasionally, and 4) in most practical wireless systems feedback channel is\noften available (e.g., for adaptive modulation, rate/power control).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jan 2009 05:35:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-20"}

The subgrid scale turbulence effects are represented by\nthe standard Smagorinsky eddy-viscosity model, which is modified by using the\nvan Driest wall-damping function for near wall effects.

We could demonstrate that for a significant range of\ndetected atom numbers the instability is limited by quantum projection noise\nonly, and that for the current status of this fountain clock the new microwave\nsource poses no limit on the achievable frequency instability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jan 2009 09:03:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-22"}

Polarization colour in the narrow bands changes at different\nepochs, perhaps related to cometary activity or molecular emission\ncontamination. The polarization was also measured in the cometary coma at\ndifferent locations along a line, in the direction of the tail.

A sample of 148 galaxy clusters at 0.1<z<0.9, with no other nearby\nclusters, show an excess of 230 cluster sources in total, an average of ~1.5\nsources per cluster. The lack of optical data for these clusters limits the\nphysical interpretation of this result, as we cannot calculate the fraction of\ncluster galaxies hosting X-ray sources. However, the fluxes of the excess\nsources indicate that over half of them are very likely to be AGN, and the\nradial distribution shows that they are quite evenly distributed over the\ncentral 1 Mpc of the cluster, with almost no sources found beyond this radius.\nWe also use this pipeline to successfully reproduce the results of previous\nstudies, particularly the higher density of sources in the central 0.5 Mpc of a\nfew cluster fields, but show that these conclusions are not generally valid for\nthis larger sample of clusters.

In such processes, pQCD not only\npredicts the hard reaction itself, but also the subsequent evolution in terms\nof parton branching and radiation, leading to a parton shower and ultimately to\nan observable jet of hadrons. If the hard process occurs in a heavy-ion\ncollision, a large part of this evolution takes place in the soft medium\ncreated along with the hard reaction. An observation of jets in heavy-ion\ncollision thus allows a study of medium-modified QCD shower evolution. In\nvacuum, Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations are well established tools to describe\nsuch showers. For jet studies in heavy-ion collisions, MC models for in-medium\nshowers are currently being developed.

In spite that the electric charging of dust\nparticles is well recognized in some contexts, it has been largely ignored in\nthe current modeling of dust coagulation. In this study, we present a general\nanalysis of the dust charge state in protoplanetary disks, and then demonstrate\nhow the electric charging could dramatically change the currently accepted\nscenario of dust coagulation. First, we describe a new semianalytical method to\ncalculate the dust charge state and gas ionization state self-consistently.\nThis method is far more efficient than previous numerical methods, and provides\na general and clear description of the charge state of gas-dust mixture.\nSecond, we apply this analysis to early evolutionary stages where the dust has\nbeen thought to grow into fractal ($D \\sim 2$) aggregates with a\nquasi-monodisperse (i.e., narrow) size distribution. We find that, for a wide\nrange of model parameters, the fractal growth is strongly inhibited by the\nelectric repulsion between colliding aggregates and eventually \"freezes out\" on\nits way to the subsequent growth stage involving collisional compression.\nStrong disk turbulence would help the aggregates to overcome this growth\nbarrier, but then it would cause catastrophic collisional fragmentation in\nlater growth stages. These facts suggest that the combination of electric\nrepulsion and collisional fragmentation would impose a serious limitation on\ndust growth in protoplanetary disks. We propose a possible scenario of dust\nevolution after the freeze-out. Finally, we point out that the fractal growth\nof dust aggregates tends to maintain a low ionization degree and, as a result,\na large magnetorotationally stable region in the disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jan 2009 15:48:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2009 04:20:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}
