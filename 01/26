This\nmarker can be used to assess the ARV potency of therapies, but is easily\naffected by drug exposures, drug resistance and other factors during the\nlong-term treatment evaluation process. HIV dynamic studies have significantly\ncontributed to the understanding of HIV pathogenesis and ARV treatment\nstrategies. However, the models of these studies are used to quantify\nshort-term HIV dynamics ($<$ 1 month), and are not applicable to describe\nlong-term virological response to ARV treatment due to the difficulty of\nestablishing a relationship of antiviral response with multiple treatment\nfactors such as drug exposure and drug susceptibility during long-term\ntreatment. Long-term therapy with ARV agents in HIV-infected patients often\nresults in failure to suppress the viral load. Pharmacokinetics (PK), drug\nresistance and imperfect adherence to prescribed antiviral drugs are important\nfactors explaining the resurgence of virus. To better understand the factors\nresponsible for the virological failure, this paper develops the\nmechanism-based nonlinear differential equation models for characterizing\nlong-term viral dynamics with ARV therapy. The models directly incorporate drug\nconcentration, adherence and drug susceptibility into a function of treatment\nefficacy and, hence, fully integrate virologic, PK, drug adherence and\nresistance from an AIDS clinical trial into the analysis. A Bayesian nonlinear\nmixed-effects modeling approach in conjunction with the rescaled version of\ndynamic differential equations is investigated to estimate dynamic parameters\nand make inference. In addition, the correlations of baseline factors with\nestimated dynamic parameters are explored and some biologically meaningful\ncorrelation results are presented. Further, the estimated dynamic parameters in\npatients with virologic success were compared to those in patients with\nvirologic failure and significantly important findings were summarized. These\nresults suggest that viral dynamic parameters may play an important role in\nunderstanding HIV pathogenesis, designing new treatment strategies for\nlong-term care of AIDS patients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jan 2009 14:57:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-27"}

The main focus of the\npresent paper is to analyze the effect of imperfections such a cavity decay and\ncollective and individual spin decoherence. We present strategies to fight\ndecoherence by monitoring cavity decay and show that high gate fidelities can\nbe achieved in the strong coupling regime of cavity-QED with state of the art\nparameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Jan 2009 20:48:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-27"}

Rectangular layouts appear in various\napplications: as rectangular cartograms in cartography, as floorplans in\nbuilding architecture and VLSI design, and as graph drawings. Often areas are\nassociated with the rectangles of a rectangular layout and it might hence be\ndesirable if one rectangular layout can represent several area assignments. A\nlayout is area-universal if any assignment of areas to rectangles can be\nrealized by a combinatorially equivalent rectangular layout. We identify a\nsimple necessary and sufficient condition for a rectangular layout to be\narea-universal: a rectangular layout is area-universal if and only if it is\none-sided. More generally, given any rectangular layout L and any assignment of\nareas to its regions, we show that there can be at most one layout (up to\nhorizontal and vertical scaling) which is combinatorially equivalent to L and\nachieves a given area assignment. We also investigate similar questions for\nperimeter assignments. The adjacency requirements for the rectangles of a\nrectangular layout can be specified in various ways, most commonly via the dual\ngraph of the layout. We show how to find an area-universal layout for a given\nset of adjacency requirements whenever such a layout exists.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Jan 2009 22:07:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-27"}

The\nsuperposition components were the N orthogonal logic basis vectors. Supposing\nthat the different logic values have \"on/off\" states only, the resultant\ndiscrete superposition state represents a single number with N bit accuracy in\na single wire, where N is the number of orthogonal logic vectors in the base.\nIn the present paper, we show that the logic hyperspace (product) vectors\ndefined in the introductory paper can be generalized to provide the discrete\nsuperposition of 2^N orthogonal system states. This is equivalent to a\nmulti-valued logic system with 2^(2^N) logic values per wire. This is a similar\nsituation to quantum informatics with N qubits, and hence we introduce the\nnotion of noise-bit. This system has major differences compared to quantum\ninformatics. The noise-based logic system is deterministic and each\nsuperposition element is instantly accessible with the high digital accuracy,\nvia a real hardware parallelism, without decoherence and error correction, and\nwithout the requirement of repeating the logic operation many times to extract\nthe probabilistic information. Moreover, the states in noise-based logic do not\nhave to be normalized, and non-unitary operations can also be used.

Some results for the exact partition function of fully packed loop\nmodels on various finite geometries are briefly reviewed, as well as the\nwell-known order-disorder bulk phase transition present in these models.\n  A detailed study is presented of the distribution of boundary nests of\npolygons in fully packed loop models with mirror or rotational symmetry. The\nprobability distribution function of such nests, as well as the average number\nof nests, are obtained analytically, albeit conjecturally. It is further shown\nthat fully packed loop models undergo another phase transition as a function of\nthe boundary nest fugacity. At criticality, we derive a scaling form for the\nnest distribution function which displays an unusual non-Gaussian cubic\nexponential behaviour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jan 2009 10:20:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-27"}

We examine this interpretation using a\nsemi-analytic model of inhomogeneous HeII reionisation and high resolution\nhydrodynamical simulations of the Lya forest. We instead find that a rapid\n(\\Delta z ~ 0.2) boost to the IGM temperature (\\Delta T ~ 10^4 K) beginning at\nz=3.4 produces a well understood and generic evolution in the Lya effective\noptical depth, where a sudden reduction in the opacity is followed by a\ngradual, monotonic recovery driven largely by adiabatic cooling in the low\ndensity IGM. This behaviour is inconsistent with the narrow feature in the\nobservational data. If photo-heating during HeII reionisation is instead\nextended over several redshift units, as recent theoretical studies suggest,\nthen the Lya opacity will evolve smoothly with redshift. We conclude that the\nsharp dip observed in the Lya forest effective optical depth is instead most\nlikely due to a narrow peak in the hydrogen photo-ionisation rate around z=3.2,\nand suggest that it may arise from the modulation of either reprocessed\nradiation during HeII reionisation, or the opacity of Lyman limit systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jan 2009 10:21:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2009 09:23:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

In this paper, we propose a novel\nsufficient termination condition, called inductive restriction, which strictly\ngeneralizes previous conditions, but can be checked as efficiently.\nFurthermore, we motivate and study the problem of data-dependent chase\ntermination and, as a key result, present sufficient termination conditions\nw.r.t. fixed instances. They are strictly more general than inductive\nrestriction and might guarantee termination although the chase does not\nterminate in the general case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jan 2009 12:09:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 May 2009 13:28:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-06"}

We present time-resolved spectroscopy and photometry of HS\n0218+3229, a new long-period cataclysmic variable discovered within the Hamburg\nQuasar Survey. It is one of the few systems that allow a dynamical measurement\nof the masses of the stellar components. Aims. We combine the analysis of\ntime-resolved optical spectroscopy and R-band photometry with the aim of\nmeasuring the mass of the white dwarf and the donor star and the orbital\ninclination. Methods. Cross-correlation of the spectra with K-type dwarf\ntemplates is used to derive the radial velocity curve of the donor star. An\noptimal subtraction of the broadened templates is performed to measure the\nrotational broadening and constrain the spectral type of the donor. Finally, an\nellipsoidal model is fitted to the R-band light curve to obtain constraints\nupon the orbital inclination of the binary system. Results. The orbital period\nof HS 0218+3229 is found to be 0.297229661 +- 0.000000001 d (7.13351186 +-\n0.00000002 h), and the amplitude of the donor's radial velocity curve is K2 =\n162.4 +- 1.4 km/s. Modelling the ellipsoidal light curves gives an orbital\ninclination in the range i = 59 +- 3 deg. A rotational broadening between 82.4\n+- 1.2 km/s and 89.4 +- 1.3 km/s is found when assuming zero and continuum limb\ndarkening, respectively. The secondary star has most likely a spectral type K5\nand contributes ~ 80-85% to the R-band light. Our analysis yields a mass ratio\nof 0.52 < q < 0.65, a white dwarf mass of 0.44 < M1(Msol) < 0.65, and a donor\nstar mass of 0.23 < M2(Msol) < 0.44. Conclusions. We find that the donor star\nin HS 0218+3229 is significantly undermassive for its spectral type. It is\ntherefore very likely that it has undergone nuclear evolution prior to the\nonset of mass transfer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jan 2009 14:50:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

No\nevolution of the flux ratios is seen with time, except at energies below 0.5\nkeV, where we found a strong decrease in the MOS to pn flux ratio with time.\nThis effect is known to be due to a gradually degrading MOS redistribution\nfunction.

By introducing an\neffective speed of sound, all the effects of radiation transport can be\nsubsumed into one single parameter. It can be shown that the growth rates of\nthe vertical modes -- which are the fastest growing ones -- are reduced by\nradiative transport. For the case of non-vertical modes, the growth rates may\ninstead be enhanced. We quantify the effects of compressibility and radiative\ndiffusion on the growth rates for the gas-pressure dominated case. The\nanalytical discussion is supplemented by numerical simulations, which are also\nused for a first investigation of the non-linear stage of the MRI in\ngas-pressure dominated accretion discs with radiation transport included.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jan 2009 15:43:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}
