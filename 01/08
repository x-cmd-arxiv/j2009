We discuss the perturbations\nintroduced in the galaxy correlation function by gravitational lensing through\nthe effect of magnification bias and its cross-correlation with the galaxy\ndensity. At the BAO scale, gravitational lensing adds a small and slowly\nvarying component to the galaxy correlation function and does not change its\nshape significantly, through which the BAO peak is measured. The relative shift\nin the position of the BAO peak caused by gravitational lensing in the\nangle-averaged correlation function is 10^-4 at z=1, rising to 10^-3 at z=2.5.\nLensing effects are stronger near the line-of-sight, however the relative peak\nshift increases only to 10^-3.3 and 10^-2.4 at z=1 and z=2.5, when the galaxy\ncorrelation is averaged within 5 degrees of the line-of-sight (containing only\n0.4% of the galaxy pairs in a survey).

We apply this idea to the\nclose-in gas giant exoplanets (\"hot Jupiters\"). The response of radiative\natmospheres is computed in a hydrostatic model which treats the insolation as a\ntime-dependent heat source, and solves for thermal radiation using flux-limited\ndiffusion. Fully nonlinear numerical simulations are compared to solutions of\nthe linearized equations, as well as analytic approximations, all of which are\nin good agreement. We find generically that thermal tide density perturbations\n{\\it lead} the semi-diurnal forcing. As a result thermal tides can generate\nasynchronous spin and eccentricity. Our results are as follows: (1) Departure\nfrom synchronous spin is significant for hot Jupiters, and increases with\norbital period.

This contribution considers the\nevolution of such a mass function due to cluster disruption, with emphasis on\nthe part of the mass function that is observable in the first ~Gyr. A Schechter\ntype function is used for the CIMF, with a power law index of -2 at low masses\nand an exponential truncation at M*. Cluster disruption due to the tidal field\nof the host galaxy and encounters with giant molecular clouds flattens the\nlow-mass end of the mass function, but there is always a part of the `evolved\nSchechter function' that can be approximated by a power law with index -2. The\nmass range for which this holds depends on age, t, and shifts to higher masses\nroughly as t^0.6. Mean cluster masses derived from luminosity limited samples\nincrease with age very similarly due to the evolutionary fading of clusters.\nEmpirical mass functions are, therefore, approximately power laws with index\n-2, or slightly steeper, at all ages. The results are illustrated by an\napplication to the star cluster population of the interacting galaxy M51, which\ncan be well described by a model with M*=(1.9+/-0.5)x10^5 M_sun and a short\n(mass-dependent) disruption time destroying M* clusters in roughly a Gyr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jan 2009 16:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

In the model the\nintrinsic X-ray emission is spatially extended and energy dependent. Absorption\ndue to the unshocked stellar winds and the cooled postshock material from the\nprimary LBV star is calculated as the intrinsic emission is ray-traced along\nmultiple sightlines through the 3D spiral structure of the circumstellar\nenvironment. The observable emission is then compared to available X-ray data,\nincluding the lightcurve observed by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) and\nspectra observed by XMM-Newton. The orientation and eccentricity of the orbit\nare explored, as are the wind parameters of the stars and the nature and\nphysics of their close approach. Our modelling supports a viewing angle with an\ninclination of ~ 42 degrees, consistent with the polar axis of the Homunculus\nnebula (Smith 2006), and the projection of the observer's line-of-sight onto\nthe orbital plane has an angle of ~ 0 - 30 degrees in the prograde direction on\nthe apastron side of the semi-major axis. However, there are significant\ndiscrepancies between the observed and model lightcurves and spectra through\nthe X-ray minimum. In particular, the hard flux in our synthetic spectra is an\norder of magnitude greater than observed. Further calculations reveal that\nradiative inhibition significantly reduces the preshock velocity of the\ncompanion wind. As a consequence the hard X-ray emission is quenched, but it is\nunclear whether the long duration of the minimum is due solely to this\nmechanism alone. Models incorporating a collapse/disruption of the WCR and/or\nreduced preshock companion wind velocities bring the predicted emission and the\nobservations into much better agreement (abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jan 2009 16:24:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The available high\nbreakdown estimators based on Least Trimmed Squares often do not succeed in\ndetecting masked high leverage outliers in finite samples.\n  An alternative to the LTS estimator, called Penalised Trimmed Squares (PTS)\nestimator, was introduced by the authors in \\cite{ZiouAv:05,ZiAvPi:07} and it\nappears to be less sensitive to the masking problem. This estimator is defined\nby a Quadratic Mixed Integer Programming (QMIP) problem, where in the objective\nfunction a penalty cost for each observation is included which serves as an\nupper bound on the residual error for any feasible regression line. Since the\nPTS does not require presetting the number of outliers to delete from the data\nset, it has better efficiency with respect to other estimators.

There\nexists only six such disjoint classes: the first three corresponding to Dirac\nspinor fields, and the other three respectively corresponding to flagpole,\nflag-dipole and Weyl spinor fields. Using the mapping from ELKO spinor fields\nto the three classes Dirac spinor fields, it is shown that the\nEinstein-Hilbert, the Einstein-Palatini, and the Holst actions can be derived\nfrom the Quadratic Spinor Lagrangian (QSL), as the prime Lagrangian for\nsupergravity. The Holst action is related to the Ashtekar's quantum gravity\nformulation. To each one of these classes, there corresponds a unique kind of\naction for a covariant gravity theory. Furthermore we consider the necessary\nand sufficient conditions to map Dirac spinor fields (DSFs) to ELKO, in order\nto naturally extend the Standard Model to spinor fields possessing mass\ndimension one. As ELKO is a prime candidate to describe dark matter and can be\nobtained from the DSFs, via a mapping explicitly constructed that does not\npreserve spinor field classes, we prove that in particular the\nEinstein-Hilbert, Einstein-Palatini, and Holst actions can be derived from the\nQSL, as a fundamental Lagrangian for supergravity, via ELKO spinor fields.

We find that the\nmotor dynamics can be characterized by two time scales: the moving-time\ninterval for the mechanical rotation of the rotor and the waiting-time interval\ndetermined by the chemical transitions of the stators. We show that these two\ntime scales depend differently on the load, and that their crossover provides\nthe microscopic explanation for the existence of two regimes in the\ntorque-speed curves observed experimentally. We also analyze the speed\nfluctuation for a single motor using our model. We show that the motion is\nsmoothed by having more stator units. However, the mechanism for such\nfluctuation reduction is different depending on the load.

We use a new set of orbits to construct the first\n(e-logP) diagram of an extensive sample of M giant binaries, to obtain their\nmass-function distribution, and to derive evolutionary constraints for this\nclass of binaries and related systems. The orbital properties of binaries\ninvolving M giants were analysed and compared with those of related families of\nbinaries (K giants, post-AGB stars, barium stars, Tc-poor S stars). The orbital\nelements of post-AGB stars and M giants are not different, which may very\nindicate that, for the considered sample of post-AGB binaries, the post-AGB\nstar left the AGB at quite an early stage (M4 or so). Neither are the orbital\nelements of post-mass-transfer binaries like barium stars very different from\nthose of M giants, suggesting that the mass transfer did not alter the orbital\nelements much, contrary to current belief. Finally, we show that binary systems\nwith e < 0.4 log P - 1 (with periods expressed in days) are predominantly\npost-mass-transfer systems, because (i) the vast majority of barium and S\nsystems match this condition, and (ii) these systems have companion masses\npeaking around 0.6 solar mass, as expected for white dwarfs. The latter\nproperty has been shown to hold as well for open-cluster binaries involving K\ngiants, for which a lower bound on the companion mass may easily be set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jan 2009 21:35:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Feb 2009 17:05:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Consequently, while\nthe previous approach only favors ferromagnetism for this system, an\nantiferromagnetic coupling is in fact possible.

These\nemission-absorption spectrum pairs are used to study the temperature of the\ninterstellar neutral hydrogen in the outer disk of the Milky Way, outside the\nsolar circle, to a radius of 25 kpc.\n  The cool neutral medium is distributed in radius and height above the plane\nwith very similar parameters to the warm neutral medium. In particular, the\nratio of the emission to the absorption, which gives the mean spin temperature\nof the gas, stays nearly constant with radius to 25 kpc radius. This suggests\nthat the mixture of cool and warm phases is a robust quantity, and that the\nchanges in the interstellar environment do not force the H I into a regime\nwhere there is only one temperature allowed. The mixture of atomic gas phases\nin the outer disk is roughly 15% to 20% cool (40 K to 60 K), the rest warm,\ncorresponding to mean spin temperature 250 to 400 K.\n  The Galactic warp appears clearly in the absorption data, and other features\non the familiar longitude-velocity diagram have analogs in absorption with even\nhigher contrast than for 21-cm emission. In the third and fourth Galactic\nquadrants the plane is quite flat, in absorption as in emission, in contrast to\nthe strong warp in the first and second quadrants. The scale height of the cool\ngas is similar to that of the warm gas, and both increase with Galactic radius\nin the outer disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jan 2009 03:41:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

We now consider\nmoderately supersonic cloud collisions (precollision cloud velocities of order\n1.2 km s$^{-1}$ to 2.4 km s$^{-1}$).\n  In the current paper, we present five SPH simulations of fast head-on and/or\noff-centre cloud collisions to study the evolution of ram pressure confined gas\nslabs. The relevant thermodynamics in the problem is simplified by adopting a\nsimple barytropic equation of state. We explore the parameter space by varying\nthe pre-collision velocity and the temperature of the post collision gas slab.\n  The temperature in a pressure compressed gas slab is crucial to its dynamical\nevolution. The pressure confined gas slabs become Jeans unstable if the average\nsound crossing time, $t_{cr}$, of putative clumps condensing out of them, is\nmuch larger than their free fall time, $t_{ff}$. Self gravitating clumps may\nspawn multiple/larger $N$-body star clusters. Warmer gas slabs are unlikely to\nfragment and may end up as diffuse gas clouds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jan 2009 05:39:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 3 May 2009 09:28:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

While food webs degree distributions have been suggested to\nfollow various functional forms, to date there has been no mechanistic or\nstatistical explanation for these forms. Here I introduce models for the degree\ndistributions of food webs based on the principle of maximum entropy (MaxEnt)\nconstrained by the number of species, number of links and the number of top or\nbasal species. The MaxEnt predictions are compared to observed distributions in\n51 food webs. The distributions of the number of consumers and resources in 23\n(45%) and 35 (69%) of the food webs respectively are not significantly\ndifferent at a 95% confidence level from the MaxEnt distribution. While the\nresource distributions of niche model webs are well-described by the MaxEnt\nmodel, the consumer distributions are more narrowly distributed than predicted\nby the MaxEnt model. These findings offer a new null model for the most\nprobable degree distributions in food webs. Having an appropriate null\nhypothesis in place allows informative study of the deviations from it; for\nexample these results suggest that there is relatively little pressure favoring\ngeneralist versus specialist consumption strategies but that there is more\npressure driving the consumer distribution away from the MaxEnt form. Given the\nmethodological idiosyncrasies of current food web data, further study of such\ndeviations will need to consider both biological drivers and methodological\nbias.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jan 2009 05:59:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-09"}

Hence there must exist an equivalent reformulation of\nquantum mechanics which does not refer to an external classical time. Such a\nreformulation is a limiting case of a more general quantum theory which becomes\nnonlinear on the Planck mass/energy scale. The nonlinearity gives rise to a\nquantum-classical duality which maps a `strongly quantum, weakly gravitational'\ndynamics to a `weakly quantum, strongly gravitational' dynamics. This duality\npredicts the existence of a tiny nonzero cosmological constant of the order of\nthe square of the Hubble constant, which could be a possible source for the\nobserved cosmic acceleration. Such a nonlinearity could also be responsible for\nthe collapse of the wave-function during a quantum measurement.

We aim to use the EROS-2 survey of the\nMagellanic Clouds to detect and study the population of beat Cepheids (BCs) in\nboth Clouds. BCs pulsating simultaneously in the first overtone and fundamental\nmodes (FO/F) or in the second and first overtone modes (SO/FO) are of\nparticular interest. Using special software designed to search for periodic\nvariables, we have scanned the EROS-2 data base for variables in the typical\nperiod range of Cepheids. Metallicities of FO/F objects were then calculated\nfrom linear nonadiabatic convective stellar models. We identify 74 FO/F BCs in\nthe LMC and 41 in the SMC, and 173 and 129 SO/FO pulsators in the LMC and SMC,\nrespectively; 185 of these stars are new discoveries. For nearly all the FO/F\nobjects we determine minimum, mean, and maximum values of the metallicity. The\nEROS data have expanded the samples of known BCs in the LMC by 31%, in the SMC\nby 110%. The FO/F objects provide independent measures of metallicities in\nthese galaxies. The mean value of metallicity is 0.0045 in the LMC and 0.0018\nin the SMC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jan 2009 09:23:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Alkali hydride molecules have permanent dipole\nsignificantly larger than those of mixed alkali species and, as pointed out by\nTaylor-Juarros et al. [Eur. Phys. J.

In this paper, using a standard quantum chemistry approach based on\npseudopotentials for atomic core representation, large Gaussian basis sets, and\neffective core polarization potential, we systematically investigate the\nelectronic properties of the alkali hydrides LiH to CsH, in order to discuss\ngeneral trends of their behavior. We computed (for the first time for NaH, KH,\nRbH, and CsH) the variation of their static polarizability with the\ninternuclear distance. Moreover, in addition to potential curves, we determine\naccurate values of permanent and transition dipole moments for ground and\nexcited states depending on the internuclear distance. The behavior of\nelectronic properties of all alkali hydrides is compared to each other, in the\nlight of the numerous other data available in the literature. Finally, the\ninfluence of the quality of the representation of the hydrogen electronic\naffinity in the approach on the results is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jan 2009 10:21:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-09"}

We recently completed a proper motion survey of three of the\nseven thermally emitting radio-quiet isolated neutron stars (INSs) discovered\nin the ROSAT all-sky survey. These INSs (RX J0420.0-5022, RX J0806.4-4123, and\nRX J1308.6+2127) either lack an optical counterpart or have one so faint that\nground based or space born optical observations push the current possibilities\nof the instrumentation to the limit. Pairs of ACIS observations were acquired 3\nto 5 years apart to measure the displacement of the sources on the X-ray sky\nusing as reference the background of extragalactic or remote Galactic X-ray\nsources. We derive 2 sigma upper limits of 123 mas/yr and 86 mas/yr on the\nproper motion of RX J0420.0-5022 and RX J0806.4-4123, respectively. RX\nJ1308.6+2127 exhibits a very significant displacement (~ 9 sigma) yielding mu =\n220 +/- 25 mas/yr, the second fastest measured among all ROSAT discovered INSs.\nThe source is probably moving away rapidly from the Galactic plane at a speed\nwhich precludes any significant accretion of matter from the interstellar\nmedium. Its transverse velocity of ~ 740 (d/700pc) km/s might be the largest of\nall ROSAT INSs and its corresponding spatial velocity stands among the fastest\nrecorded for neutron stars. RX J1308.6+2127 is thus a middle-aged (age ~ 1 My)\nhigh velocity cooling neutron star. We investigate its possible origin in\nnearby OB associations or from a field OB star. In most cases, the flight time\nfrom birth place appears significantly shorter than the characteristic age\nderived from spin down rate. The distribution in transverse velocity of ROSAT\nINSs is not statistically different from that of normal radio pulsars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jan 2009 10:34:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Such a forcing includes as particular cases two\nknown techniques for reducing friction drag: the oscillating wall technique (a\ntraveling wave with infinite phase speed) and the recently proposed steady\ndistribution of spanwise velocity (a wave with zero phase speed).\n  The traveling waves alter the friction drag significantly. Waves which slowly\ntravel forward produce a large reduction of drag, that can relaminarize the\nflow at low values of the Reynolds number. Faster waves yield a totally\ndifferent outcome, i.e. drag increase. Even faster waves produce a drag\nreduction effect again. Backward-traveling waves instead lead to drag reduction\nat any speed.\n  The traveling waves, when they reduce drag, operate in similar fashion to the\noscillating wall, with an improved energetic efficiency.

In theory, the shocked fast wind\n(hot bubble) and the ambient cold nebula can remain separated by magnetic\nfields along a surface referred to as the contact discontinuity (CD) that\ninhibits diffusion and heat conduction. The CD region is extremely difficult to\nprobe directly owing to its small size and faint emission. This has largely\nleft the study of CDs, stellar-shocks, and the associated micro-physics in the\nrealm of theory. This paper presents spectroscopic evidence for ions from the\nhot bubble (kT ~ 100 eV) crossing the CD and penetrating the cold nebular gas\n(kT ~ 1 eV). Specifically, a narrow radiative recombination continuum (RRC)\nemission feature is identified in the high resolution X-ray spectrum of the PN\nBD+30 3639 indicating bare C VII ions are recombining with cool electrons at\nkT_e=1.7+-1.3 eV. An upper limit to the flux of the narrow RRC of H-like C VI\nis obtained as well. The RRCs are interpreted as due to C ions from the hot\nbubble of BD+30 3639 crossing the CD into the cold nebula, where they\nultimately recombine with its cool electrons. The RRC flux ratio of C VII to C\nVI constrains the temperature jump across the CD to Delta kT > 80 eV, providing\nfor the first time direct evidence for the stark temperature disparity between\nthe two sides of an astrophysical CD, and constraining the role of magnetic\nfields and heat conduction accordingly. Two colliding-wind binaries are noted\nto have similar RRCs suggesting a temperature jump and CD crossing by ions may\nbe a common feature of stellar wind shocks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jan 2009 13:36:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2009 11:27:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

In this paper we\nlist and discuss some aspects of these developments -such as for instance the\nhyperquantization algorithm- as well as a few applications to quantum gravity\nand topology, thus providing evidence of a unifying background structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jan 2009 15:52:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-14"}

Previous studies have suggested that coronal loops in the core of\nan active region are not seen cooling through lower temperatures and therefore\nare steadily heated. If loops were cooling, the transition region would be an\nideal temperature regime to look for a signature of their evolution. The\nExtreme-ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on Hinode provides monochromatic\nimages of the solar transition region and corona at an unprecedented cadence\nand spatial resolution, making it an ideal instrument to shed light on this\nissue. Analysis of observations of active region 10978 taken in 2007 December 8\n-- 19 indicates that there are two dominant loop populations in the active\nregion: core multi-temperature loops that undergo a continuous process of\nheating and cooling in the full observed temperature range 0.4-2.5 MK and even\nhigher as shown by the X-Ray Telescope (XRT); and peripheral loops which evolve\nmostly in the temperature range 0.4-1.3 MK. Loops at transition region\ntemperatures can reach heights of 150 Mm in the corona above the limb and\ndevelop downflows with velocities in the range of 39-105 km/s.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jan 2009 15:55:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}
