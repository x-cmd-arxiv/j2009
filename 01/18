The successful deposition of AlOx-MTJs demonstrated the capability\nof BTIBD to make multilayer structures with good film quality. MTJ thin film\nsurface roughness and intermixing between layers are among the key problems\nleading to low TMR performance. Here by studying the bias voltage effect on MTJ\nproperties via the measurement of Neel coupling field and TMR, we suggest that\nthe lower bias voltage reduces the intermixing that occurs when top CoFe free\nlayer is deposited on AlOx barrier, but produces relatively high surface\nroughness.

Currently, most brown dwarfs\nwith independently determined ages are companions to nearby stars, so stellar\nages are at the heart of the effort to test substellar models. However, these\nmodels are only fully constrained if both the mass and age are known. We have\nused the Keck adaptive optics system to monitor the orbit of HD 130948BC, a\nbrown dwarf binary that is a companion to the young solar analog HD 130948A.\nThe total dynamical mass of 0.109+/-0.003 Msun shows that both components are\nsubstellar, and the ensemble of available age indicators from the primary star\nsuggests an age comparable to the Hyades, with the most precise age being 0.79\nGyr based on gyrochronology. Therefore, HD 130948BC is unique among field L and\nT dwarfs as it possesses a well-determined mass, luminosity, and age. Our\nresults indicate that substellar evolutionary models may underpredict the\nluminosity of brown dwarfs by as much as a factor of ~2-3x. The implications of\nsuch a systematic error in evolutionary models would be far-reaching, for\nexample, affecting determinations of the initial mass function and predictions\nof the radii of extrasolar gas-giant planets. This result is largely based on\nthe reliability of stellar age estimates, and the case study of HD 130948A\nhighlights the difficulties in determining the age of an arbitrary field star,\neven with the most up-to-date chromospheric activity and gyrochronology\nrelations. In order to better assess the potential systematic errors present in\nsubstellar models, more refined age estimates for HD 130948A and other stars\nwith binary brown dwarf companions (e.g., eps Ind Bab) are critically needed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Jan 2009 01:28:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

This problem arises in a range of\napplications such as collaborative filtering, distributed computation of trust\nand reputation, monitoring and other tasks, where the computing nodes is\nexpected to preserve the privacy of their inputs while performing a joint\ncomputation of a certain function. Although there is a rich literature in the\nfield of distributed systems security concerning secure multi-party\ncomputation, in practice it is hard to deploy those methods in very large scale\nPeer-to-Peer networks. In this work, we try to bridge the gap between\ntheoretical algorithms in the security domain, and a practical Peer-to-Peer\ndeployment.\n  We consider two security models. The first is the semi-honest model where\npeers correctly follow the protocol, but try to reveal private information. We\nprovide three possible schemes for secure multi-party numerical computation for\nthis model and identify a single light-weight scheme which outperforms the\nothers. Using extensive simulation results over real Internet topologies, we\ndemonstrate that our scheme is scalable to very large networks, with up to\nmillions of nodes.

For this\nmodel we provide a fourth scheme to defend the execution of the computation\nagainst the malicious peers. The proposed scheme has a higher complexity\nrelative to the semi-honest model.

IPMs have thus far mostly been used in\nmore abstract settings, for instance as theoretical tools in mass\ntransportation problems, and in metrizing the weak topology on the set of all\nBorel probability measures defined on a metric space. Practical applications of\nIPMs are less common, with some exceptions in the kernel machines literature.\nThe present work contributes a number of novel properties of IPMs, which should\ncontribute to making IPMs more widely used in practice, for instance in areas\nwhere $\\phi$-divergences are currently popular.\n  First, to understand the relation between IPMs and $\\phi$-divergences, the\nnecessary and sufficient conditions under which these classes intersect are\nderived: the total variation distance is shown to be the only non-trivial\n$\\phi$-divergence that is also an IPM. This shows that IPMs are essentially\ndifferent from $\\phi$-divergences. Second, empirical estimates of several IPMs\nfrom finite i.i.d. samples are obtained, and their consistency and convergence\nrates are analyzed. These estimators are shown to be easily computable, with\nbetter rates of convergence than estimators of $\\phi$-divergences. Third, a\nnovel interpretation is provided for IPMs by relating them to binary\nclassification, where it is shown that the IPM between class-conditional\ndistributions is the negative of the optimal risk associated with a binary\nclassifier. In addition, the smoothness of an appropriate binary classifier is\nproved to be inversely related to the distance between the class-conditional\ndistributions, measured in terms of an IPM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Jan 2009 13:20:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2009 09:31:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2009 18:06:29 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2009 03:15:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-13"}

The phase boundary lines are\nmonotonous for both $\\nu=1$ and $\\nu >2$, while the solitons with $\\nu=2$\nreveal peculiar nonmonotonous behavior, determining the transition regime from\nlow to high topological charges. In particular, the soliton energy per\ntopological charge (topological energy density) achieves a minimum neither for\n$\\nu=1$ nor high charges, but rather for intermediate values $\\nu=2$ or\n$\\nu=3$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Jan 2009 15:05:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

First, it is proven that the existence of hom-connections with\nrespect to the universal differential graded algebra is tantamount to the\ninjectivity, and that every finitely cogenerated injective module admits a\nhom-connection with respect to any differential graded algebra. The bulk of the\npaper is devoted to describing a method of constructing hom-connections from\ntwisted multi-derivations. The notion of a free twisted multi-derivation is\nintroduced and the induced first order differential calculus is described. It\nis shown that any free twisted multi-derivation on an algebra A induces a\nunique hom-connection on A that vanishes on the dual basis for the module of\none-forms. To any flat hom-connection \\nabla on A one associates a chain\ncomplex, termed a complex of integral forms on A. The canonical cokernel\nmorphism to the zeroth homology space is called a \\nabla-integral. Examples of\nfree twisted multi-derivations, hom-connections and corresponding integral\nforms are provided by covariant calculi on Hopf algebras or quantum groups and\non quantum spaces. The example of a flat hom-connection within the 3D\nleft-covariant differential calculus on the quantum group SL(2) is described in\nfull detail. A descent of hom-connections to the base algebra of a faithfully\nflat Hopf-Galois extension or a principal comodule algebra is studied. As an\nexample, a hom-connection on the standard quantum Podles sphere is presented.\nIn both cases the complex of integral forms is shown to be isomorphic to the de\nRham complex, and the \\nabla-integrals coincide with Hopf-theoretic integrals\nor invariant (Haar) measures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Jan 2009 15:44:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-20"}

It\nis assumed that the incoming radiation creates an ac voltage between the source\nand gate and that the gate length is long compared to the damping length of\nplasma waves. In the presence of pronounced Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations, an\nimportant source of non-linearity is the oscillating dependence of the mobility\non the ac gate voltage. This results in a photoresponse oscillating as a\nfunction of magnetic field, which is enhanced in the vicinity of the cyclotron\nresonance, in accordance with recent experiments.
