We provide a rigorous geometrical\nkinematical definition of the general Kundt spacetime in 4 dimensions;\nessentially a Kundt spacetime is defined as one admitting a null vector that is\ngeodesic, expansion-free, shear-free and twist-free. A Kundt spacetime is said\nto be degenerate if the preferred kinematic and curvature null frames are all\naligned. The degenerate Kundt spacetimes are the only spacetimes in 4\ndimensions that are not $\\mathcal{I}$-non-degenerate, so that they are not\ndetermined by their scalar polynomial curvature invariants. We first discuss\nthe non-aligned Kundt spacetimes, and then turn our attention to the degenerate\nKundt spacetimes. The degenerate Kundt spacetimes are classified algebraically\nby the Riemann tensor and its covariant derivatives in the aligned kinematic\nframe; as an example, we classify Riemann type D degenerate Kundt spacetimes in\nwhich $\\nabla(Riem),\\nabla^{(2)}(Riem)$ are also of type D. We discuss other\nlocal characteristics of the degenerate Kundt spacetimes. Finally, we discuss\ndegenerate Kundt spacetimes in higher dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Jan 2009 19:29:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2009 22:40:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-09"}

Dembski claims to have established a robust decision process\nthat can determine when observed structures in the natural world can be\nattributed to design. Dembski's decision process first asks whether a structure\nas an outcome can be explained by the regularity of natural laws. If not, and\nthe outcome can be \"specified\", a randomness test is devised to determine\nwhether an observed low probability outcome indicates design. It is argued in\nthis paper that the Dembski test is unworkable and is better formulated in\nterms of a Martin Loef universal randomness test. A universal randomness test\nwill show that most observed outcomes in the natural world are non random; they\nare highly ordered. However this does not necessarily demonstrate design, as\nthe decision is not between chance and design, but between natural laws and\ndesign. The Dembski decision template, which eliminates natural processes in\nthe first decision step, is flawed, forcing a design outcome when none is\nwarranted. Dembski also introduces a 4th law of thermodynamics, the law of\nconservation of information to argue information cannot emerge from random\nprocesses. However if a more robust measure of information based on algorithmic\nentropy is used, the so called 4th law is seen to contain no more than the\nsecond law of thermodynamics.\n  In conclusion, despite the good intentions, the approach fails to offer any\nnew insights into the adequacy of evolutionary theory and should not be\nregarded as demonstrable science.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Jan 2009 21:18:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Jan 2009 01:15:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 15 Jan 2009 01:28:56 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2009 03:47:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-15"}

In particular, clusters\nwith large Einstein radii provide a wealth of multiply imaged systems in the\ncluster core allowing to determine precisely the shape of the central dark\nmatter profile. This paper presents a spectroscopic survey in the massive\ncluster Abell 1703, displaying a large Einstein radius (28\" at z=2.8) and a\nhigh number of strongly-lensed systems including a central ring-like\nconfiguration. We used LRIS on Keck to target multiple images and lensed galaxy\ncandidates, and use the measured redshifts to constrain the mass distribution\nof the cluster using a parametric model. The data enable us to measure accurate\nredshifts in good agreement with their photometric redshifts, and to update the\nidentification of multiply imaged systems by discovering 3 new systems and a\nradial counter image. We also report the discovery of a remarkably bright ~3.6\nL* i-band dropout at z=5.827 in our mask which is only moderately magnified by\nthe cluster (~3.0+/-0.08). The improved parametric mass model, including 16\nmultiple systems with 10 spectroscopic redshifts, further constrains the\ncluster-scale mass distribution with a generalized NFW profile of best-fit\nlogarithmic slope alpha=0.92+/-0.04, concentration c200=4.72+/-0.40 and scale\nradius rs=476+/-45 kpc. Our strong-lensing model predicts a large scale shear\nsignal consistent with Subaru weak-lensing measurements out to 4 Mpc h^-1.\nTogether with the fact that the strong-lensing modeling requires a single dark\nmatter clump, this suggests that Abell 1703 is a relaxed, unimodal cluster.\nThis unique cluster could be probed further using deep X-ray, SZ and dynamics\nanalysis, for a detailed study of the physics in a relaxed cluster.

A non-trivial extension of the\npartition-function method of probability calculus to quantum mechanics is\ngiven. Non-commutativity of quantum variables limits its usefulness. Still, the\ngeneral form of the state operators of ME packets is obtained with its help.\nThe diagonal representation of the operators is found.

Classical mechanics is reinterpreted as a statistical theory.\nClassical trajectories are replaced by classical ME packets.

We suggest the model of the\nradio pulse formation in the Vela pulsar, develop the theory of the radio\nphoton reprocessing to high energies and on this basis interpret the observed\nX-ray - radio connection. The processes of spontaneous and induced scattering\nof radio waves off the spiraling particles and their observational consequences\nare examined. The particles are assumed to acquire relativistic gyration\nenergies due to resonant absorption of the radio emission in the outer\nmagnetosphere of a pulsar. The spectral and angular distributions of the\nspontaneously scattered power are analyzed and compared with the\ncharacteristics of the particle synchrotron emission. The consequences of\nintensity transfer from the radio beam to the background in the course of\ninduced scattering are studied as well. It is demonstrated that the induced\nscattering can account for the basic features of the Vela's radio profile and\nits pulse-to-pulse fluctuations. In particular, it can explain a greater role\nof the leading component and its earlier arrival in stronger pulses. The\nstudies of the radio photon reprocessing to high energies in application to the\nVela pulsar shows that the scattered and synchrotron spectra peak at 0.8 and\n0.2 keV, respectively, with the corresponding luminosities of 10^{29} erg\ns^{-1} and 10^{31} erg s^{-1}. Within the framework of our model, the observed\nX-ray - radio connection is explained in terms of the interplay between the\nprocesses of induced and spontaneous scattering of the radio pulse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jan 2009 11:07:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Away from equilibrium, one may describe the microscopic\ntime evolution by a general differentiable dynamical system, identify\nnonequilibrium steady states (NESS), and study how these vary under\nperturbations of the dynamics. Remarkably, it turns out that for uniformly\nhyperbolic dynamical systems (those satisfying the \"chaotic hypothesis\"), the\nlinear response away from equilibrium is very similar to the linear response\nclose to equilibrium: the Kramers-Kronig dispersion relations hold, and the\nfluctuation-dispersion theorem survives in a modified form (which takes into\naccount the oscillations around the \"attractor\" corresponding to the NESS). If\nthe chaotic hypothesis does not hold, two new phenomena may arise. The first is\na violation of linear response in the sense that the NESS does not depend\ndifferentiably on parameters (but this nondifferentiability may be hard to see\nexperimentally). The second phenomenon is a violation of the dispersion\nrelations: the susceptibility has singularities in the upper half complex\nplane. These \"acausal\" singularities are actually due to \"energy\nnonconservation\": for a small periodic perturbation of the system, the\namplitude of the linear response is arbitrarily large.

The approximated\nexpression of electrostatic interaction between two conductors, usually\nemployed in EFM and KPM, may loose its validity when probe-sample distance is\nnot very small, as often realized when realistic nanostructured systems with\ncomplex topography are investigated. In such conditions, electrostatic\ninteraction does not depend solely on the potential difference between probe\nand sample, but instead it may depend on the bias applied to each conductor.\nFor instance, electrostatic force can change from repulsive to attractive for\ncertain ranges of applied potentials and probe-sample distances, and this fact\ncannot be accounted for by approximated models.
