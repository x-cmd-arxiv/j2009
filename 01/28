Both of these methods have disadvantages that\nnegatively impact their accuracy in certain situations. We here propose a novel\nscheme which largely eliminates these weaknesses. It is based on a moving\nunstructured mesh defined by the Voronoi tessellation of a set of discrete\npoints. The mesh is used to solve the hyperbolic conservation laws of ideal\nhydrodynamics with a finite volume approach, based on a second-order unsplit\nGodunov scheme with an exact Riemann solver. The mesh-generating points can in\nprinciple be moved arbitrarily. If they are chosen to be stationary, the scheme\nis equivalent to an ordinary Eulerian method with second order accuracy. If\nthey instead move with the velocity of the local flow, one obtains a Lagrangian\nformulation of hydrodynamics that does not suffer from the mesh distortion\nlimitations inherent in other mesh-based Lagrangian schemes. In this mode, our\nnew method is fully Galilean-invariant, unlike ordinary Eulerian codes, a\nproperty that is of significant importance for cosmological simulations. In\naddition, the new scheme can adjust its spatial resolution automatically and\ncontinuously, and hence inherits the principal advantage of SPH for simulations\nof cosmological structure growth. The high accuracy of Eulerian methods in the\ntreatment of shocks is retained, while the treatment of contact discontinuities\nimproves. We discuss how this approach is implemented in our new parallel code\nAREPO, both in 2D and 3D. We use a suite of test problems to examine the\nperformance of the new code and argue that it provides an attractive and\ncompetitive alternative to current SPH and Eulerian techniques.

We outline the\nevidence that the parent compounds, while metallic, have electron interactions\nthat are sufficiently strong to produce incipient Mott physics. In other words,\nin terms of the strength of electron correlations compared to the kinetic\nenergy, the iron pnictides are closer to intermediately-coupled systems lying\nat the boundary between itinerancy and localization, such as V2O3 or Se-doped\nNiS2, rather than to simple antiferromagnetic metals like Cr. This level of\nelectronic correlations produces a new small parameter for controlled\ntheoretical analyses, namely the fraction of the single-electron spectral\nweight that lies in the coherent part of the excitation spectrum. Using this\nexpansion parameter, we construct the effective low-energy Hamiltonian and\ndiscuss its implications for the magnetic order and magnetic quantum\ncriticality. Finally, this approach sharpens the notion of magnetic frustration\nfor such a metallic system, and brings about a multiband matrix t-J1-J2 model\nfor the carrier-doped iron pnictides.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jan 2009 20:56:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 May 2009 17:46:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-22"}

Interestingly, for ideal sparse signals with no measurement\nnoise, random measurements allow perfect reconstruction while measurements\nbased on principal component analysis (PCA) or independent component analysis\n(ICA) do not. At the same time, for other signal and noise distributions, PCA\nand ICA can significantly outperform random projections in terms of enabling\nreconstruction from a small number of measurements. In this paper we ask: given\nthe distribution of signals we wish to measure, what are the optimal set of\nlinear projections for compressed sensing? We consider the problem of finding a\nsmall number of linear projections that are maximally informative about the\nsignal. Formally, we use the InfoMax criterion and seek to maximize the mutual\ninformation between the signal, x, and the (possibly noisy) projection y=Wx. We\nshow that in general the optimal projections are not the principal components\nof the data nor random projections, but rather a seemingly novel set of\nprojections that capture what is still uncertain about the signal, given the\nknowledge of distribution. We present analytic solutions for certain special\ncases including natural images. In particular, for natural images, the\nnear-optimal projections are bandwise random, i.e., incoherent to the sparse\nbases at a particular frequency band but with more weights on the\nlow-frequencies, which has a physical relation to the multi-resolution\nrepresentation of images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jan 2009 16:12:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-28"}

We find significant departures from case B predictions in\nthe Balmer and Paschen flux ratios of lines of high principal quantum number n.\nWe analyze the ionization structure of HH202-S, finding enough evidence to\nconclude that the flow of HH202-S has compressed the ambient gas inside the\nnebula trapping the ionization front. We measure a strong increase of the total\nabundances of nickel and iron in the shock component, the abundance pattern and\nthe results of photoionization models for both components are consistent with\nthe partial destruction of dust after the passage of the shock wave in HH202-S.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jan 2009 18:56:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The small mass splitting delta M should be <~ 100 keV. In addition, we\nrequire at least two new gauge bosons (preferably three), with masses ~100 MeV.\nWith this spectrum, chi_1 is stable, but can be excited to chi_2 by\nlow-velocity DM scatterings near the galactic center, which are\nSommerfeld-enhanced by two of the 100 MeV gauge boson exchanges. The excited\nstate chi_2 decays to chi_0 and nonrelativistic e+e-, mediated by the third\ngauge boson, which mixes with the photon and Z. Although such a small 100 keV\nsplitting has been independently proposed for explaining the DAMA annual\nmodulation through the inelastic DM mechanism, the need for stability of chi_1\n(and hence seqestering it from the Standard Model) implies that our scenario\ncannot account for the DAMA signal. It can however address the PAMELA/ATIC\npositron excess via DM annihilation in the galaxy, and it offers the\npossibility of a sharper feature in the ATIC spectrum relative to previously\nproposed models.

Two main channels\nhave been suggested to produce such stars: (1) collisions between stars in\nclusters or (2) mass transfer between, or merger of, the components of\nprimordial short-period binaries. Here we suggest a third scenario, in which\nthe progenitor of BSSs are formed in primordial (or dynamically formed)\nhierarchical triple stars. In such configurations the dynamical evolution of\nthe triples through the Kozai mechanism and tidal friction can induce the\nformation of very close inner binaries. Angular momentum loss in a magnetized\nwind or stellar evolution could then lead to the merger of these binaries (or\nto mass transfer between them) and produce BSSs in binary (or triple) systems.\nWe study this mechanism and its implications and show that it could naturally\nexplain many of the characteristics of the BSS population in clusters, most\nnotably the large binary fraction of long period BSS binaries; their unique\nperiod-eccentricity distribution (with typical periods > 700 days); and the\ntypical location of these BSSs in the color-magnitude diagram, far from the\ncluster turn-off point of their host clusters. We suggest that this scenario\nhas a major (possibly dominant) role in the formation of BSSs in open clusters\nand give specific predictions for the the BSSs population formed in this\nmanner.

By combining this spectral index distribution with 1.4 GHz source\ncounts we predict 31 GHz source counts in the range 1 mJy < S_31 < 4 mJy,\nN(>S_31) = (16.7 +/- 1.7) deg^2 (S_31/1 mJy)^(-0.80 +/- 0.07). We also assess\nthe contribution of mJy-level (S_1.4 < 3.4 mJy) radio sources to the 31 GHz CMB\npower spectrum, finding a mean power of ell (ell+1) C^src_ell/(2 pi) = 44 +/-\n14 micro-Kelvin^2 and a 95% upper limit of 80 micro-Kelvin^2 at ell = 2500.\nIncluding an estimated contribution of 12 micro-Kelvin^2 from the population of\nsources responsible for the turn-up in counts below S_1.4 = 1 mJy this amounts\nto 21 +/- 7 % of what is needed to explain the CBI high-ell excess signal, 275\n+/- 63 micro-Kelvin^2.

The JCM is an exactly soluble quantum mechanical model, which describes\nthe interaction between a two-level atom and a single cavity mode of the\nelectromagnetic field. If we prepare the atom in the ground state and the\ncavity mode in a coherent state initially, the JCM causes the collapse and the\nrevival of the Rabi oscillations many times in a complicated pattern in its\ntime-evolution. In this phenomenon, the atomic population inversion is\ndescribed with an intractable infinite series. (When the electromagnetic field\nis resonant with the atom, the $n$th term of this infinite series is given by a\ntrigonometric function for $\\sqrt{n}t$, where $t$ is a variable of the time.)\nAccording to Klimov and Chumakov's method, using the Abel-Plana formula, we\nrewrite this infinite series as a sum of two integrals.

In the limit of zero\ninter-site hopping and sufficiently large on-site interaction, the phase\ndiagram is a complete devil's staircase for filling fractions between 0 and 1,\nwherein every commensurate state at a rational filling is stable over a finite\ninterval in chemical potential. We perturb away from this limit in two\nexperimentally motivated directions involving the addition of hopping and a\nreduction of the onsite interaction. The addition of hopping alone yields a\nphase diagram, which we compute in perturbation theory in the hopping, where\nthe commensurate Mott phases now compete with the superfluid. Further softening\nof the onsite interaction yields alternative commensurate states with double\noccupancies which can form a staircase of their own, as well as one-dimensional\n\"supersolids\" which simultaneously exhibit discrete broken symmetries and\nsuperfluidity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jan 2009 22:30:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-13"}

At any\nparticular time, each receiver will see a superposition of the transmitted\nsignals plus noise. The standard approach to such a scenario results in each\ntransmitter-receiver pair achieving a rate proportional to 1/K its\ninterference-free ergodic capacity. However, given two well-chosen time\nindices, the channel coefficients from interfering users can be made to exactly\ncancel. By adding up these two observations, each receiver can obtain its\ndesired signal without any interference. If the channel gains have independent,\nuniform phases, this technique allows each user to achieve at least 1/2 its\ninterference-free ergodic capacity at any signal-to-noise ratio. Prior\ninterference alignment techniques were only able to attain this performance as\nthe signal-to-noise ratio tended to infinity. Extensions are given for the case\nwhere each receiver wants a message from more than one transmitter as well as\nthe \"X channel\" case (with two receivers) where each transmitter has an\nindependent message for each receiver. Finally, it is shown how to generalize\nthis strategy beyond Gaussian channel models.

They can be equivalently\ndescribed as parabolic geometries corresponding to the contact grading of\northogonal real Lie algebra. It follows the underlying geometric structure can\nbe interpreted in several equivalent ways. In particular, we show this is given\nby a split-quaternionic structure on the contact distribution, which is\ncompatible with the Levi bracket. In this vein, we study the geometry of\nchains, a distinguished family of curves appearing in any parabolic contact\ngeometry. Also to the system of chains there is associated a canonical\nparabolic geometry of specific type. Up to some exceptions in low dimensions,\nit turns out this can be obtained by an extension of the parabolic geometry\nassociated to the Lie contact structure if and only if the latter is locally\nflat. In that case we can show that chains are never geodesics of an affine\nconnection, hence, in particular, the path geometry of chains is always\nnon-trivial. Using appropriately this fact, we conclude that the path geometry\nof chains allows to recover the Lie contact structure, hence, in particular,\ntransformations preserving chains must preserve the Lie contact structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jan 2009 12:00:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-29"}

We consider\nparticle sizes that range from approximately 1 micron up to a few\nmillimeters.We use a grid--based MHD code to perform global two-fluid\nsimulations of turbulent protoplanetary discs which contain dust grains of\nvarious sizes. In quasi--steady state, the gravitational settling of dust\nparticles is balanced by turbulent diffusion. Simple and standard models of\nthis process fail to describe accurately the vertical profile of the dust\ndensity. The disagreement is larger for small dust particles (of a few microns\nin size), especially in the disc upper layers ($Z>3H$, where $H$ is the\nscale-height). Here there can be orders of magnitude in the disagreement\nbetween the simple model predictions and the simulation results. This is\nbecause MHD turbulence is not homogeneous in accretion discs, since velocity\nfluctuations increase significantly in the disc upper layer where a strongly\nmagnetized corona develops. We provide an alternative model that gives a better\nfit to the simulations. In this model, dust particles are diffused away from\nthe midplane by MHD turbulence, but the diffusion coefficient varies vertically\nand is everywhere proportional to the square of the local turbulent vertical\nvelocity fluctuations. The spatial distribution of dust particles can be used\nto trace the properties of MHD turbulence in protoplanetary discs, such as the\namplitude of the velocity fluctuations. In the future, detailed and direct\ncomparison between numerical simulations and observations should prove a useful\ntool for constraining the properties of turbulence in protoplanetary discs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jan 2009 10:45:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The shift\nwe observe for the 3d Anderson model obeys a power law as predicted by Larkin\nand Khmel'nitskii (1981). We compute the exponent and find good agreement with\nthe prediction. However, the power law holds only for much smaller magnetic\nfields than has been previously assumed, and is accompanied by a large\nprefactor, leading to a surprising strong dependence of the transition point on\nthe applied magnetic field. Furthermore, we show that the critical\nlevel-spacing distribution is identical in the presence and absence of a\nmagnetic field if hard-wall boundary conditions are applied. This result is\nsurprising since both cases belong to different universality classes and\ndifferent distributions have been reported for periodic boundary conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jan 2009 13:05:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-29"}

The uncontrollable interaction\nof the transmission network with a noisy environment is usually assumed to\ndeteriorate its transport capacity, especially so when the system is\nfundamentally quantum mechanical. Here we identify key mechanisms through which\nnoise such as dephasing, perhaps counter intuitively, may actually aid\ntransport through a dissipative network by opening up additional pathways for\nexcitation transfer. We show that these are processes that lead to the\ninhibition of destructive interference and exploitation of line broadening\neffects. We illustrate how these mechanisms operate on a fully connected\nnetwork by developing a powerful analytical technique that identifies the\ninvariant (excitation trapping) subspaces of a given Hamiltonian. Finally, we\nshow how these principles can explain the remarkable efficiency and robustness\nof excitation energy transfer from the light-harvesting chlorosomes to the\nbacterial reaction center in photosynthetic complexes and present a numerical\nanalysis of excitation transport across the Fenna-Matthew-Olson (FMO) complex\ntogether with a brief analysis of its entanglement properties.
