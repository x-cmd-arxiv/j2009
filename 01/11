At fixed M* and formation time, BCGs\nat lower z are larger and have smaller velocity dispersions, i.e. Re increases\nand sigma decreases with age. As a result, at z~0.25, corresponding to a\nlookback time of order 3 Gyrs, BCGs are smaller than their lower z counterparts\nby as much as 70% for the brightest BCGs: Re evolves as (1+z)^{0.85(Mr+21)}.\nQualitatively similar but weaker evolution in the sizes is also seen in the\nbulk of the early-type population: at Mr<-22 Re evolves as (1+z)^{0.7(Mr+21)},\nwhile at Mr>-22 the evolution is approximately (1+z)^{-0.7}, independent of Mr.\nThe sigma-L correlation also evolves: (1+z)^{-0.2(Mr+21)} at Mr < -22 (as for\nthe BCGs) and (1+z)^{0.2} for fainter galaxies. The Re- and sigma-M*\ncorrelations yield consistent results. These trends are most easily understood\nif early-type BCGs grew from many dry minor mergers rather than a few major\nmergers. Only in such a scenario can BCGs be the descendents of the superdense\ngalaxies seen at z~2; major dry mergers, which increase the size in proportion\nto the mass, cannot bring these galaxies onto the BCG Re-M* relation at z~0. We\nalso compared the ages and sizes of our early-type BCGs with satellites. BCGs\nare larger than satellites of similar L or M* at the same redshift. Although\nboth satellites and BCGs trace the same weak age-L or age-M* relation, this can\nbe understood by noting that BCGs are typically about 1 Gyr older than the\nsatellites in their group, and they are about 0.5 mags more luminous. Finally,\nwe find that the mean satellite L is approximately independent of BCG L, in\nagreement with recent predictions based on the L-dependence of clustering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Jan 2009 20:53:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Feb 2009 20:01:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

One could therefore expect that in dilute solid H\nsolutions in Pd the fundamental band of optical H vibrations should be reduced\nto a narrow line of 3-fold degenerate, non-interacting isotropic local\noscillators. A few attempts to test this assumption by inelastic neutron\nscattering gave ambiguous results due to the very small limiting hydrogen\nconcentration, x<0.001, of the PdH$_x$ solutions at low temperatures. We\nincreased maximum x by alloying Pd with 20 at% Au and studied disordered\nPd$_{0.8}$Au$_{0.2}$H$_{x}$ solutions with concentrations varying from x = 0.03\nto 0.74. According to reported $^{197}$Au Mossbauer studies, hydrogen atoms in\nthe Pd$_{0.8}$Au$_{0.2}$H$_{x}$ solutions with x < (0.8)^{6} = 0.26 can only\noccupy interstices having no Au neighbours. This abates the effect of H-Au\ninteractions in the solutions with lower H concentrations and effectively\nprevents hydrogen clustering at low temperatures. Our INS investigation showed\nthat the fundamental optical H band in both concentrated and dilute\nPd$_{0.8}$Au$_{0.2}$H$_{x}$ solutions consists of a sharp peak with a broad\nshoulder towards higher energies. The shoulder shows no tendency to vanish with\ndecreasing H concentration and amounts to approximately 0.44 integral intensity\nof the main peak in all studied samples. The optical band in infinitely diluted\nH solutions in Pd should therefore consist of a peak with a pronounced shoulder\ntoo. Implications for the isotopic effects in the hydrogen solubility in Pd are\nconsidered in the present paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Jan 2009 11:56:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-13"}

To explain this unexpected behavior, we propose a shock model\nconcept that utilizes a well-known magnetic propulsion mechanism; the surface\nejection of \"diamagnetic plasmoids\" into a diverging external magnetic field.\nThis produces rapidly accelerating self-contained structures that plow through\nan ambient wind and form bow shocks that generate a range in X-ray temperatures\ndetermined by the plasmoid-wind relative velocities. The model free parameters\nare the plasmoid initial Alfven speed, the initial plasma-beta of the external\nmedium, and the divergence rate of the external field. These are determined by\nfitting the predicted bow shock temperatures with the observed OB supergiant\nX-ray temperature distribution. We find that the initial external plasma-beta\nhas a range between 0 and 2, and the assumed radially-decreasing external\nmagnetic field strength that scales as r^{-S} has a value of S lying between 2\nand 3. Most importantly, the initial plasmoid Alfven speed is found to be\nwell-constrained at a value of 0.6 times the terminal velocity, which appears\nto represent an upper limit for all normal OB stars.

NLS1 galaxies differ from BLS1 with respect to\nseveral properties. They are generally more variable in 2-10 keV energy band so\nthe natural expectation is the need to use a different scaling coefficient\nbetween the mass and the variance in these two types of sources. However, we\nfind that such a simple approach is not enough. Although for majority of the 21\nNLS1 galaxies in our sample a single scaling coefficient (larger by a factor\n20) provided us with a satisfactory method of mass determination, in a small\nsubset of NLS1 galaxies this approach failed. Variability of those objects\nappeared to be at the intermediate level between NLS1 and BLS1 galaxies. These\nexceptional NLS1 galaxies have much harder soft X-ray spectra than majority of\nNLS1 galaxies. We thus postulate that the division of Seyfert 1 galaxies into\nBLS1 and NLS1 according to the widths of the Hbeta line is less generic than\naccording to the soft X-ray slope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Jan 2009 14:07:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2009 14:36:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-21"}

The interaction between\nprestress, geometrically non-linear behaviour, as well as damping and its\ncoupling with the aforementioned phenomena has to be taken into account for a\ncomprehensive understanding of the structural behaviour. Since the literature\non this subject lacks a clear procedure to derive models of thin prestressed\nand damped structures from 3D continuum mechanics, this paper presents a new\nderivation of models for thin structures accounting for generic prestress,\nmoderate rotations and viscous damping. Although inspired by classical\napproaches, the proposed procedure is quite different, because of (i) the\ndefinition of a modified Hu-Washizu (H-W) functional, accounting for stress\nconstraints associated with Lagrange multipliers, in order to derive\nlower-dimensional models in a convenient way; (ii) an original definition of a\n(mechanical and thermal) strain measure and a rotation measure enabling one to\nidentify the main terms in the strain energy and to derive a cascade of\nlower-dimensional models (iii) a new definition of \"strain-rotation domains\"\nproviding a clear interpretation of the classical assumptions of \"small\nperturbations\" and \"small strains and moderate rotations\"; (iv) the\nintroduction of a pseudo-potential with stress constraints to account for\nviscous damping.

Two major\ndifferences are the presence of plastic strains during unloading phases and the\nabsence of an elastic domain. Later, the endochronic plasticity theory was\nmodified in order to introduce the effect of damage. In the present paper, a\nbasic endochronic model with isotropic damage is formulated starting from the\npostulate of strain equivalence. Unlike the previous similar analyses, in this\npresentation the formal tools chosen to formulate the model are those of convex\nanalysis, often used in classical plasticity: namely pseudopotentials,\nindicator functions, subdifferentials, etc. As a result, the notion of loading\nsurface for an endochronic model of plasticity with damage is investigated and\nan insightful comparison with classical models is made possible.
