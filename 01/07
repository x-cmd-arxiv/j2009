In this paper we investigate\nthe general properties that a viable IDM candidate must have and search for\nsimple models that realize these properties in natural ways. We begin by\ndetermining the regions of IDM parameter space that are allowed by direct\ndetection searches including DAMA, paying special attention to larger IDM\nmasses. We observe that an inelastic dark matter candidate with electroweak\ninteractions can naturally satisfy observational constraints while\nsimultaneously yielding the correct thermal relic abundance. We comment on\nseveral other proposed dark matter explanations for the DAMA signal and\ndemonstrate that one of the proposed alternatives -- elastic scattering of dark\nmatter off electrons -- is strongly disfavored when the modulated and\nunmodulated DAMA spectral data are taken into account. We then outline the\ngeneral essential features of IDM models in which inelastic scattering off\nnuclei is mediated by the exchange of a massive gauge boson, and construct\nnatural models in the context of a warped extra dimension and supersymmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jan 2009 20:03:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2009 20:29:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-17"}

The most\npopular model to explain the SDP is Hight Latitude Emission (HLE). Many models\nfor the prompt emission give rise to HLE, like the popular internal shocks (IS)\nmodel, but some models do not, such as sporadic magnetic reconnection events.\nKnowing if the SDP is consistent with HLE would thus help distinguish between\ndifferent prompt emission models. In order to test this, we model the prompt\nemission (and its tail) as the sum of independent pulses (and their tails). A\nsingle pulse is modeled as emission arising from an ultra-relativistic thin\nspherical expanding shell. We obtain analytic expressions for the flux in the\nIS model with a Band function spectrum. We find that in this framework the\nobserved spectrum is also a Band function, and naturally softens with time. The\ndecay of the SDP is initially dominated by the tail of the last pulse, but\nother pulses can dominate later. Modeling several overlapping pulses as a\nsingle broader pulse would overestimates the SDP flux. One should thus be\ncareful when testing the HLE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jan 2009 17:47:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-25"}

We consider a grid of models highlighting\nthe impact of varying the values for the free parameters used, such as star\nformation and feedback efficiency. The most critical factor is the assumption\nthat only one Population III star is formed in a halo. In this scenario, metal\nfree stars contribute only to a minor fraction of the total number of photons\nrequired to re-ionize the universe. In addition, metal free star formation is\nprimarily located in minihalos and chemically enriched halos become the\ndominant locus of star formation very early in the life of the Universe, at\nredshift z~25.

In addition, these\nstars have opaque circumstellar material, obscuring the central star, so that\nno detailed surface abundance studies can be performed. We propose a different\nindicator for the supergiant status of a B[e] star, based on the enrichment of\nits circumstellar matter by 13C, and detectable via its 13CO band emission in\nthe K band spectra. Based on stellar evolution models, we calculate the\nvariation of the 12C/13C isotopic surface abundance ratio during the evolution\nof non-rotating stars with different initial masses. For different values of\nthe 12C/13C ratio we then compute synthetic first-overtone vibration-rotational\nband spectra from both the 12CO and 13CO molecule at different spectral\nresolutions. We further discuss the influence of stellar rotation on the\nvariation of the surface 12C/13C ratio. The surface 12C/13C isotope ratio is\nfound to decrease strongly during the post-main sequence evolution of\nnon-rotating stars, from its interstellar value of about 70 to a value of about\n15-20 for stars with initial masses higher than 7 M_sun, and to a value of less\nthan 5 for stars with initial masses higher than 25 M_sun.

It is known that\nthe assumed functional form of the PPS in cosmological parameter estimation can\naffect the best fit parameters and their relative confidence limits. In this\npaper, we demonstrate that a specific assumed form actually drives the best fit\nparameters into distinct basins of likelihood in the space of cosmological\nparameters where the likelihood resists improvement via modifications to the\nPPS. The regions where considerably better likelihoods are obtained allowing\nfree form PPS lie outside these basins. In the absence of a preferred model of\ninflation, this raises a concern that current cosmological parameters estimates\nare strongly prejudiced by the assumed form of PPS.

The field has seen the advent of a number\nof alternative semantics, with Kripke-Kleene semantics, the well-founded\nsemantics, the stable model semantics, and the answer-set semantics standing\nout as the most successful. We show that all aforementioned semantics are\nparticular cases of a generic semantics, in a framework where classical\nnegation is the unique form of negation and where the literals in the bodies of\nthe rules can be `marked' to indicate that they can be the targets of\nhypotheses. A particular semantics then amounts to choosing a particular\nmarking scheme and choosing a particular set of hypotheses. When a literal\nbelongs to the chosen set of hypotheses, all marked occurrences of that literal\nin the body of a rule are assumed to be true, whereas the occurrences of that\nliteral that have not been marked in the body of the rule are to be derived in\norder to contribute to the firing of the rule. Hence the notion of hypothetical\nreasoning that is presented in this framework is not based on making global\nassumptions, but more subtly on making local, contextual assumptions, taking\neffect as indicated by the chosen marking scheme on the basis of the chosen set\nof hypotheses. Our approach offers a unified view on the various semantics\nproposed in logic programming, classical in that only classical negation is\nused, and links the semantics of logic programs to mechanisms that endow\nrule-based systems with the power to harness hypothetical reasoning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jan 2009 22:50:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 May 2011 05:27:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-09"}

Distributed connection preemption is an important example where nodes\ncan make intelligent decisions on allocating resources and controlling traffic\nflows for multi-class service networks. A challenge is that nodal decisions are\nspatially dependent as traffic flows trespass multiple nodes in a network.\nHence the performance-complexity trade-off becomes important, i.e., how\naccurate decisions are versus how much information is exchanged among nodes.\nConnection preemption is known to be NP-complete. Centralized preemption is\noptimal but computationally intractable. Decentralized preemption is\ncomputationally efficient but may result in a poor performance. This work\ninvestigates distributed preemption where nodes decide whether and which flows\nto preempt using only local information exchange with neighbors. We develop,\nbased on the probabilistic graphical models, a near-optimal distributed\nalgorithm. The algorithm is used by each node to make collectively near-optimal\npreemption decisions. We study trade-offs between near-optimal performance and\ncomplexity that corresponds to the amount of information-exchange of the\ndistributed algorithm. The algorithm is validated by both analysis and\nsimulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jan 2009 04:36:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-08"}

The evidence for the conjectures is based on\na study of the stochastic properties of this map in conjunction with dynamical\nsystems techniques.

The aim is to study the efficiency of the grain alignment as a function of\ncloud position and to study the observable consequences of these spatial\nvariations.

The continuum radiative transfer problem is solved with Monte\nCarlo methods to estimate the 3D distribution of dust emission and the\nradiation field strength affecting the grain alignment. We also examine the\neffect of grain growth in cores. We are able to reproduce the results of Cho &\nLazarian using their assumptions. However, the anisotropy factor even in the 1D\ncase is lower than their assumption of $\\gamma = 0.7$, and thus we get less\nefficient radiative torques. Compared with our previous paper, the polarization\ndegree vs. intensity relation is steeper because of less efficient grain\nalignment within dense cores. Without grain growth, the magnetic field of the\ncores is poorly recovered above a few $A_{\\rm V}$. If grain size is doubled in\nthe cores, the polarization of dust emission can trace the magnetic field lines\npossibly up to $A_{\\rm V} \\sim 10$ magnitudes. However, many of the prestellar\ncores may be too young for grain coagulation to play a major role. The\ninclusion of direction dependent radiative torque efficiency weakens the\nalignment.

Fundamental and structural\nparameters were derived with colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), stellar radial\ndensity profiles (RDPs) and mass functions (MFs). Most previous studies centred\nNGC 2244 close to the bright K0V star 12 Monocerotis, which is not a cluster\nmember. Instead, the near-IR RDP indicates a pronounced core near the O5 star\nHD 46150. We derive an age within 1--6 Myr, an absorption $\\aV=1.7\\pm0.2$, a\ndistance from the Sun $\\ds=1.6\\pm0.2$ kpc ($\\approx1.5$ kpc outside the Solar\ncircle), an MF slope $\\chi=0.91\\pm0.13$ and a total (MS+PMS) stellar mass of\n$\\sim625 \\ms$. Its RDP is characterised by the core and cluster radii\n$\\rc\\approx5.6\\arcmin$ ($\\approx2.6$ pc) and $\\rl\\approx10\\arcmin$\n($\\approx4.7$ pc), respectively. Departure from dynamical equilibrium is\nsuggested by the abnormally large core radius and the marked central stellar\nexcess. We also investigate the elusive neighbouring OC NGC 2239, which is\nlow-mass ($m_{MS+PMS}\\approx301 \\ms$), young ($5\\pm4$ Myr) rather absorbed\n($\\aV=3.4\\pm0.2$), and located in the background of NGC 2244 at $\\ds=3.9\\pm0.4$\nkpc. Its RDP follows a King-like function of $\\rc\\approx0.5\\arcmin\\approx0.5$\npc and $\\rl\\approx5.0\\arcmin\\approx5.6$ pc. The MF slope, $\\chi=1.24\\pm0.06$,\nis essentially Salpeter's IMF. NGC 2244 is probably doomed to dissolution in a\nfew $10^7$ yr. Wide-field extractions and field-star decontamination increase\nthe stellar statistics and enhance both CMDs and RDPs, which is essential for\nfaint and bright star clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jan 2009 13:58:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}
