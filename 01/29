We used a sample of over 700 red sequence,\nstructurally-selected early-type galaxies (defined to have Sersic index >2.5)\nwith redshifts 0<z<1 taken from the Extended Chandra Deep Field South (173\ngalaxies) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (550 galaxies), constructing\nrest-frame U-V colors accurate to <0.04mag. We find that the scatter of the CMR\nof cosmic average early-type galaxies is ~0.1mag in rest-frame U-V color at\n0.05<z<0.75, and somewhat higher at z=1. We compared these observations with a\nmodel in which new red sequence galaxies are being constantly added at the rate\nrequired to match the observed number density evolution, and found that this\nmodel predicts the correct CMR scatter and its evolution. Furthermore, this\nmodel predicts approximately the correct number density of `blue spheroids' -\nstructurally early-type galaxies with blue colors - albeit with considerable\nmodel dependence. Thus, we conclude that both the evolution of the number\ndensity and colors of the early-type galaxy population paint a consistent\npicture in which the early-type galaxy population grows significantly between\nz=1 and the present day through the quenching of star formation in blue cloud\ngalaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jan 2009 19:25:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

We suggest that the 1665 and 1720 masers\narise from a region close to the central star, possibly in a torus, while the\n1612 and 1667 lines originate mainly from the extended northern lobe of the\noutflow. It is worth noting that the location and velocity of the OH 1720 MHz\nmaser emission are very similar to those of the H2O masers (coinciding within\n0.1\" and ~2 km/s, respectively). We suggest that the pumping mechanism in the\nH2O masers could be produced by the same shock that is exciting the OH 1720 MHz\ntransition. A high degree of circular polarization (>50%) was found to be\npresent in some features of the 1612, 1665, and 1720 MHz emission.For the 1665\nMHz transition at ~ +18 km/s the emission with left and right circular\npolarizations (LCP and RCP) coincide spatially within a region of ~0.03\" in\ndiameter.Assuming that these RCP and LCP 1665 features come from a Zeeman pair,\nwe estimate a magnetic field of ~0.9 mG within 150 AU from the 1.3 cm continuum\npeak. This value is in agreement with a solar-type magnetic field associated\nwith evolved stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jan 2009 16:11:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

To provide a proper microscopic description of these\ncompounds, we use extensive band structure calculations for real materials and\nmodel structures and supplement this analysis with simulations of thermodynamic\nproperties, thus facilitating a direct comparison with the experimental data.\nDue to the reduced symmetry, the realistic spin model of layered vanadium\nphosphates AA'VO(PO4)2 includes four inequivalent exchange couplings: J1 and\nJ1' between nearest-neighbors and J2 and J2' between next-nearest-neighbors.\nThe estimates of individual exchange couplings suggest different regimes, from\nJ1'/J1 and J2'/J2 close to 1 in BaCdVO(PO4)2, a nearly regular frustrated\nsquare lattice, to J1'/J1 ~ 0.7 and J2'/J2 ~ 0.4 in SrZnVO(PO4)2, a frustrated\nsquare lattice with sizable distortion.

In order to learn more about the\nplanetary companion and its possible influence on the evolution of its host\nstar (subdwarf B star formation is still not well understood), an accurate\ncharacterisation of the host star is required. As part of an ongoing effort to\nsignificantly improve the asteroseismic characterisation of the host star, we\ninvestigate the low-frequency behaviour of HS2201+2610. We obtained rapid high\nsignal-to-noise photometric CCD (B-filter) and PMT (clear-filter) data at\n2m-class telescopes and carried out a careful frequency analysis of the light\ncurves. In addition to the previously known short-period luminosity variations\nin the range 342s-367s, we find a long-period variation with a period of 54min\nand an amplitude of 0.15 per cent. This can most plausibly be identified with a\ng-mode pulsation, so that HS2201+2610 is a new addition to the short list of\nhybrid sdB pulsators.

The results on two binary MgB2 wires and\nan alloyed wire with 10 wt.% B4C are presented The strongest enhancement was\nmeasured at 20K, where cold densification at 1.85 GPa on a binary Fe/MgB2 wire\nraised both Jcpara and Jcperp by more than 300% at 5T, while Birr was enhanced\nby 0.7 T. At 4.2K, the enhancement of Jc was smaller, but still reached 53% at\n10 T. After applying pressures up to 6.5 GPa, the mass density dm of the\nunreacted (B+Mg) mixture inside the filaments reached 96% of the theoretical\ndensity. After reaction under atmospheric pressure, this corresponds to a\nhighest mass density df in the MgB2 filaments of 73%. After reaction, the\nelectrical resistance of wires submitted to cold densification was found to\ndecrease, reflecting an improved connectivity. A quantitative correlation\nbetween filament mass density and the physical properties was established.\nMonofilamentary rectangular wires with aspect ratios a/b < 1.25 based on low\nenergy ball milled powders exhibited very low anisotropy ratios, Gamma =\nJcpara/Jcperp being < 1.4 at 4.2 K and 10T. The present results can be\ngeneralized to alloyed MgB2 wires, as demonstrated on a wire with B4C\nadditives. Based on the present data, it follows that cold densification has\nthe potential of further improving the highest Jcpara and Jcperp values\nreported so far for in situ MgB2 tapes and wires with SiC and C additives.\nInvestigations are under work in our laboratory to determine whether the\ndensification method CHPD can be applied to longer wire or tape lengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jan 2009 20:38:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Being of spectral subtype\nWO2, WR142 is a massive star in a very advanced evolutionary stage, short\nbefore its explosion as a supernova or gamma-ray burst. This is the first\ndetection of X-ray emission from a WO-type star. We rule out any serendipitous\nX-ray sources within approx 1\" of WR142. WR142 has an X-ray luminosity of\nL_X=7\\times10^{30} erg/s, which constitutes only $\\lsim 10^{-8}$ of its\nbolometric luminosity. The hard X-ray spectrum suggests a plasma temperature of\nabout 100 MK.

From\nqualitative considerations we conclude that this mechanism cannot account for\nthe hardness of the observed radiation. There are no hints for a binary\ncompanion. Therefore the only remaining, albeit speculative explanation must\nrefer to magnetic activity. Possibly related, WR142 seems to rotate extremely\nfast, as indicated by the unusually round profiles of its optical emission\nlines.

PAH molecules are\nmodeled as planar disks with in-plane and out-of-plane vibrational dipoles. As\nfirst pointed out by Leger (1988), infrared emission features resulting from\nin-plane and out-of-plane modes should have orthogonal polarization directions.\nWe show analytically how the degree of polarization depends on the viewing\ngeometry and the molecule's internal alignment between principal axis of\ninertia and angular momentum, which gets worse after photon absorption. Longer\nwavelength features, emitted after better internal alignment is recovered,\nshould be more strongly polarized. The degree of polarization for\nuni-directional illumination (e.g., by a star) is larger than for diffuse\nillumination (e.g., by a disk galaxy), all else being equal. For PAHs in the\nCold Neutral Medium, the predicted polarization is probably too small to\ndistinguish from the contribution of linear dichroism by aligned foreground\ndust.

To gain insight into this problem, we perform\nhigh-resolution (N=720^3 - 1584^3) simulations of an Einstein-de Sitter\ncosmology where the initial power spectrum is P(k) propto k^n, with -2.5 < n <\n-1.

For technical reasons, comparing large networks is\ncomputationally infeasible, and thus heuristics such as the degree distribution\nhave been sought. It is easy to demonstrate that two networks are different by\nsimply showing a short list of properties in which they differ. It is much\nharder to show that two networks are similar, as it requires demonstrating\ntheir similarity in all of their exponentially many properties. Clearly, it is\ncomputationally prohibitive to analyze all network properties, but the larger\nthe number of constraints we impose in determining network similarity, the more\nlikely it is that the networks will truly be similar.\n  We introduce a new systematic measure of a network's local structure that\nimposes a large number of similarity constraints on networks being compared. In\nparticular, we generalize the degree distribution, which measures the number of\nnodes 'touching' k edges, into distributions measuring the number of nodes\n'touching' k graphlets, where graphlets are small connected non-isomorphic\nsubgraphs of a large network. Our new measure of network local structure\nconsists of 73 graphlet degree distributions (GDDs) of graphlets with 2-5\nnodes, but it is easily extendible to a greater number of constraints (i.e.\ngraphlets). Furthermore, we show a way to combine the 73 GDDs into a network\n'agreement' measure. Based on this new network agreement measure, we show that\nalmost all of the 14 eukaryotic PPI networks, including human, are better\nmodeled by geometric random graphs than by Erdos-Reny, random scale-free, or\nBarabasi-Albert scale-free networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jan 2009 00:30:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-30"}

From the X-ray data and archival near infra-red data of Two Micron All\nSky survay, we derive the profiles of components constituting the NGC 1550\nsystem; the gas mass, total mass, metal mass, and galaxy luminosity.

As\nfirst revealed with {\\it ASCA}, the data reconfirms the presence of a dark\nhalo, of which the mass ($1.6 \\times 10^{13} M_{\\odot}$) is typical of a galaxy\ngroup rather than of a single galaxy. Within 210 kpc, the $K$-band\nmass-to-light ratio reaches $75 M_{\\odot}/L_{\\odot}$, which is comparable to\nthose of clusters of galaxies. The iron-mass-to-light ratio profile (silicon-\nand oxygen mass-to-light ratio profiles as well) exhibits about two orders of\nmagnitude decrease toward the center. Further studies comparing mass densities\nof metals with those of the other cluster components reveal that the iron (as\nwell as silicon) in the ICM traces very well the total gravitating mass,\nwhereas the stellar component is significantly more concentrated to within\nseveral tens kpc of the NGC 1550 nucleus. Thus, in the central region, the\namount of metals is significantly depleted for the luminous galaxy light. Among\na few possible explanations of this effect, the most likely scenario is that\ngalaxies in this system were initially much more extended than today, and\ngradually fell to the center and merged into NGC 1550.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jan 2009 10:03:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

The inelastic response of the lattice elements is described\nby a damage approach, which corresponds to a continuous reduction of the\nstiffness of the springs.

The spatial distribution of dissipated energy density at the\nmeso-scale of concrete is determined.

The security analysis of\nthese schemes, however, leaves open the possibility that the development of\nbetter proof techniques, or better classical post-processing methods, might\nfurther improve their performance in realistic scenarios. In this paper, we\nderive upper bounds on the secure key rate for decoy state QKD. These bounds\nare based basically only on the classical correlations established by the\nlegitimate users during the quantum communication phase of the protocol. The\nonly assumption about the possible post-processing methods is that double click\nevents are randomly assigned to single click events. Further we consider only\nsecure key rates based on the uncalibrated device scenario which assigns\nimperfections such as detection inefficiency to the eavesdropper. Our analysis\nrelies on two preconditions for secure two-way and one-way QKD: The legitimate\nusers need to prove that there exists no separable state (in the case of\ntwo-way QKD), or that there exists no quantum state having a symmetric\nextension (one-way QKD), that is compatible with the available measurements\nresults. Both criteria have been previously applied to evaluate single-photon\nimplementations of QKD. Here we use them to investigate a realistic source of\nweak coherent pulses. The resulting upper bounds can be formulated as a convex\noptimization problem known as a semidefinite program which can be efficiently\nsolved. For the standard four-state QKD protocol, they are quite close to known\nlower bounds, thus showing that there are clear limits to the further\nimprovement of classical post-processing techniques in decoy state QKD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jan 2009 12:56:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

A combined analysis of the WASP\nphotometry, high-precision followup transit photometry and radial velocities\nyield a planetary mass M_p = 0.503 +0.019-0.038 M_jup and radius R_p = 1.224\n+0.051-0.052 R_jup, resulting in a density rho_p = 0.27 +-0.05 rho_jup. The\nmass and radius for the host star are M_s = 0.88 +0.05-0.08 M_sun and R_s =\n0.870 +0.025-0.036 R_sun. The non-zero orbital eccentricity e = 0.054\n+0.018-0.015 that we measure suggests that the planet underwent a massive tidal\nheating ~1 Gyr ago that could have contributed to its inflated radius.\nHigh-precision radial velocities obtained during a transit allow us to measure\na sky-projected angle between the stellar spin and orbital axis Beta = 11\n+14-18 deg. In addition to similar published measurements, this result favors a\ndominant migration mechanism based on tidal interactions with a protoplanetary\ndisk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jan 2009 15:24:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The spectra change smoothly as a function\nof the compositio n $x$. On the Ge side of the composition range, the lowest\nexcitations at the ab sorption edge are almost pure Kohn-Sham\nindependent-particle HOMO-LUMO transitio ns, while for higher Si contents\nstrong mixing of transitions is found. Within T DLDA the first peak is slightly\nhigher in energy than in earlier independent-par ticle calculations. However,\nthe absorption onset and in particular its composit ion dependence is similar\nto independent-particle results. Moreover, classical depolarization effects are\nresponsible for a very strong suppression of the abs orption intensity. We show\nthat they can be taken into account in a simpler way using Maxwell-Garnett\nclassical effective-medium theory. Emission spectra are in vestigated by\ncalculating the absorption of excited nanocrystals at their relaxe d geometry.\nThe structural contribution to the Stokes shift is about 0.5 eV. Th e\ndecomposition of the emission spectra in terms of independent-particle transit\nions is similar to what is found for absorption. For the emission, very weak\ntra nsitions are found in Ge-rich clusters well below the strong absorption\nonset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jan 2009 15:33:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}
