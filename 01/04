To\ndate, 9 magnetic HAeBe stars have been detected, and those detections confirmed\nby repeated observations. The morphology and variability of their Stokes V\nsignatures indicates that their magnetic fields have important dipole\ncomponents of kG strength, and that the dipole is stable on timescales ofat\nleast years. These magnetic stars exhibit a large range of stellar mass, from\nabout 2-13 solar masses, and diverse rotational properties, with vsini from a\nfew km/s to 200 km/s. Most magnetic HAeBe stars show approximately solar\nabundances; they clearly do not generally exhibit the strong and systematic\npeculiarities of the magnetic main sequence A and B type stars (the Ap/Bp\nstars). The observed fractional bulk incidence of magnetic HAeBe stars is about\n7%, a value compatible with the incidence of magnetic intermediate-mass stars\non the main sequence. This low incidence is at odds with formation scenarios\ngenerally involving magnetically-mediated accretion. The similarily between the\nmagnetic properties of the pre-main sequence and main sequence\nintermediate-mass stars appears compatible with the hypothesis of a fossil\norigin of magnetism in these objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Jan 2009 02:10:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-21"}

Interestingly, when the networks with\noptimal performance deviate from the steady state networks under pure\nmutations, we find the evolution behaves as a balance between mutation and\nselection. Furthermore, when the timescales of mutations and dynamical\nprocesses are comparable with each other, the steady state of evolution is\nmainly determined by mutation. On the opposite side, when the timescale of\nmutations is much longer than that of dynamical processes, selection dominates\nthe evolution and the steady-state networks turn to have much improved\nperformance and highly heterogeneous structures.
