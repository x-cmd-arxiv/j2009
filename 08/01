The dual\nprovides a basis for the \"leading singularities\" of scattering amplitudes to\nall orders in perturbation theory, which are sharply defined, IR safe data that\nuniquely determine the full amplitudes at tree level and 1-loop, and are\nconjectured to do so at all loop orders. The scattering amplitude for n\nparticles in the sector with k negative helicity gluons is associated with a\nsimple integral over the space of k planes in n dimensions, with the action of\nparity and cyclic symmetries manifest. The residues of the integrand compute a\nbasis for the leading singularities. A given leading singularity is associated\nwith a particular choice of integration contour, which we explicitly identify\nat tree level and 1-loop for all NMHV amplitudes as well as the 8 particle\nNNMHV amplitude. We also identify a number of 2-loop leading singularities for\nup to 8 particles. There are a large number of relations among residues which\nfollow from the multi-variable generalization of Cauchy's theorem known as the\n\"global residue theorem\". These relations imply highly non-trivial identities\nguaranteeing the equivalence of many different representations of the same\namplitude. They also enforce the cancellation of non-local poles as well as\nconsistent infrared structure at loop level. Our conjecture connects the\nphysics of scattering amplitudes to a particular subvariety in a Grassmannian;\nspace-time locality is reflected in the topological properties of this space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2009 18:54:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-22"}

For a closed system this\nwas exemplified by an exact matrix product operator solution of the\ntime-evolved creation operator of a quadratic fermi chain with a matrix\ndimension of just two. In this work we show that this exact solution can be\nsignificantly generalized to include the case of an open quadratic fermi chain\nsubjected to master equation evolution with Lindblad operators that are linear\nin the fermionic operators. Remarkably even in this open system the\ntime-evolution of operators continues to be described by matrix product\noperators with the same fixed dimension as that required by the solution of a\ncoherent quadratic fermi chain for all times. Through the use of matrix product\nalgorithms the dynamical behaviour of operators in this non-equilibrium open\nquantum system can be computed with a cost that is linear in the system size.\nWe present some simple numerical examples which highlight how useful this might\nbe for the more detailed study of open system dynamics.

This is at variance with previous claims\nregarding heavier annihilating DM particles. Should DM be made of lighter\nparticles, the current constraints from 511 keV observations on the\nannihilation cross section or decay rate still prevent a detectable SZ effect.\nFinally, we show that spatial diffusion sets a core of a few kpc in the\nelectron distribution, even for very cuspy DM profiles, such that improving the\nangular resolution of the instrument, e.g. with ALMA, does not necessarily\nimprove the detection potential.

Nine of the objects in the sample (including\nNGC 5548) showed optical variability of sufficient strength during the\nmonitoring campaign to allow for a time lag to be measured between the\ncontinuum fluctuations and the response to these fluctuations in the broad\nHbeta emission. We present here the light curves for the objects in this sample\nand the subsequent Hbeta time lags for the nine objects where these\nmeasurements were possible. The Hbeta lag time is directly related to the size\nof the broad-line region, and by combining the lag time with the measured width\nof the Hbeta emission line in the variable part of the spectrum, we determine\nthe virial mass of the central supermassive black hole in these nine AGNs. The\nabsolute calibration of the black hole masses is based on the normalization\nderived by Onken et al. We also examine the time lag response as a function of\nvelocity across the Hbeta line profile for six of the AGNs. The analysis of\nfour leads to ambiguous results with relatively flat time lags as a function of\nvelocity. However, SBS 1116+583A exhibits a symmetric time lag response around\nthe line center reminiscent of simple models for circularly orbiting broad-line\nregion (BLR) clouds, and Arp 151 shows an asymmetric profile that is most\neasily explained by a simple gravitational infall model. Further investigation\nwill be necessary to fully understand the constraints placed on physical models\nof the BLR by the velocity-resolved response in these objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2009 20:04:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The second is a\n`golf course' potential defined by microstates having two possible energies\nwith exponentially more high energy states than low energy states. The\nequilibration time for replica exchange is analyzed for both systems. For the\ndouble well system, parallel tempering with a number of replicas that scales as\nthe square root of the barrier height yields exponential speedup of the\nequilibration time. On the other hand, replica exchange yields only marginal\nspeed-up for the golf course system. For the double well system, the free\nenergy difference between the two wells has a large effect on the equilibration\ntime. Nearly degenerate wells equilibrate much more slowly than strongly\nasymmetric wells. It is proposed that this difference in equilibration time may\nlead to a bias in measuring overlaps in spin glasses.

An intuitive picture is developed based upon a\nperturbation theory for shifting material boundaries that allows the\noptomechanical properties to be designed and optimized. Several designs are\npresented with mechanical frequency ~ 1-10 GHz, optical Q-factor Qo > 10^7,\nmotional masses meff 100 femtograms, optomechanical coupling length LOM < 5\nmicrons, and a radiation-limited mechanical Q-factor Qm > 10^7.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2009 23:24:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-13"}

We compare our observational results\nwith predictions of accretion theory and use them to test different aspects of\nthe physical model of the system. Methods: In our analysis we use the data\naccumulated with Swift/BAT starting from the beginning of 2005 (shortly after\nlaunch) until the present time. To search for pulsations and for their\nsubsequent analysis we used the count rate measured by the BAT detector in the\nentire field of view. Results: The slope of the correlation between the locally\ndetermined spin-up rate and the X-ray luminosity is measured for Her X-1 and\nfound to be in agreement with predictions of basic accretion torque theory. The\nobserved behaviour of the pulse period together with the previously measured\nsecular decrease of the system's orbital period is discussed in the frame of a\nmodel assuming ejection of matter close to the inner boundary of the accretion\ndisk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Aug 2009 06:27:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

We introduce four mixed statistics\nwith respect to a bipartition of rows or columns of $\\M$. More precisely, let\n$S \\subseteq \\{1,2,..., n\\}$ and $\\mathcal{R}(S)$ be the union of rows whose\nindices are in $S$. For any filling $M$, the top-mixed (resp. bottom-mixed)\nstatistic $\\alpha(S; M)$ (resp. $\\beta(S; M)$) is the sum of the number of\nnortheast chains whose top (resp. bottom) cell is in $\\mathcal{R}(S)$, together\nwith the number of southeast chains whose top (resp. bottom) cell is in the\ncomplement of $\\mathcal{R}(S)$. Similarly, we define the left-mixed and\nright-mixed statistics $\\gamma(T; M)$ and $\\delta(T; M)$, where $T$ is a subset\nof the column index set $\\{1,2,..., m\\}$. Let $\\lambda(A; M)$ be any of these\nfour statistics $\\alpha(S; M)$, $\\beta(S; M)$, $\\gamma(T; M)$ and $\\delta(T;\nM)$, we show that the joint distribution of the pair $(\\lambda(A; M),\n\\lambda(\\bar A; M))$ is symmetric and independent of the subsets $S, T$. In\nparticular, the pair of statistics $(\\lambda(A;M), \\lambda(\\bar A; M))$ is\nequidistributed with $(\\se(M),\\ne(M))$, where $\\se(M)$ and $\\ne(M)$ are the\nnumbers of southeast chains and northeast chains of $M$, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Aug 2009 12:23:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-04"}

However,\ninternet access from mobile devices is very expensive due to limited bandwidth\navailable on wireless links and high mobility rate of mobile hosts. When a user\nexecutes a transaction with a web portal from a mobile device, the\ndisconnection necessitates failure of the transaction or redoing all the steps\nafter reconnection, to get back into consistent application state. Thus\nconsidering challenges in wireless mobile networks, a new log management scheme\nis proposed for recovery of mobile transactions.\n  In this proposed approach, the model parameters that affect application state\nrecovery are analyzed. The proposed scheme is compared with the existing Lazy\nand Pessimistic scheme and a trade off analysis between the cost invested to\nmanage log and the return of investment in terms of improved failure\nrecoverability is made. From the analysis, the best checkpoint interval period\nthat yields the best return of investment is identified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Aug 2009 13:32:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-23"}

The algorithm is\nestablished to be order-wise optimal i.e., no other distributed algorithm can\ndetermine changes in the path topology using lesser order of bits (i.e., marked\npackets). The algorithm is shown to have a computational complexity of O(d log\nd), which is significantly less than that of any existing non-incremental\nalgorithm of algebraic traceback.
