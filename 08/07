Special\nshapes such as ring galaxies with inward and outward arms are also described by\nthe analytic continuation of the same formula. The formula is r(phi) = A/log[B\ntan(phi/2N)]. This function intrinsically generates a bar in a continuous,\nfixed relationship relative to an arm of arbitrary winding sweep. A is simply a\nscale parameter while B, together with N, determine the spiral pitch. Roughly,\ngreater N results in tighter winding. Greater B results in greater arm sweep\nand smaller bar/bulge while smaller B fits larger bar/bulge with a sharper\nbar/arm junction. Thus B controls the \"bar/bulge-to-arm\" size, while N controls\nthe tightness much like the Hubble scheme. The formula can be recast in a form\ndependent only on a unique point of turnover angle of pitch - essentially a\n1-parameter fit, aside from a scale factor. The recast formula is remarkable\nand unique in that a single parameter can define a spiral shape with either\nconstant or variable pitch capable of tightly fitting Hubble types from grand\ndesign spirals to late type large-barred galaxies. We compare the correlation\nof our pitch parameter to Hubble type with that of the traditional logarithmic\nspiral for 21 well-shaped galaxies. The pitch parameter of our formula produces\na very tight correlation with ideal Hubble type suggesting it is a good\ndiscriminator compared to logarithmic pitch, which shows poor correlation here\nsimilar to previous works.

Therefore, under these assumptions, securing\nthe network does not entail a loss in the per-node throughput. The\nachievability argument is based on a novel multi-hop forwarding scheme where\nrandomization is added in every hop to ensure maximal ambiguity at the\neavesdropper(s). Secondly, an ergodic fading model with $n$ source-destination\npairs and $n_e$ eavesdroppers is considered. Employing the ergodic interference\nalignment scheme with an appropriate secrecy pre-coding, each user is shown to\nachieve a constant positive secret rate for sufficiently large $n$. Remarkably,\nthe scheme does not require eavesdropper CSI (only the statistical knowledge is\nassumed) and the secure throughput per node increases as we add more legitimate\nusers to the network in this setting. Finally, the effect of eavesdropper\ncollusion on the performance of the proposed schemes is characterized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Aug 2009 18:58:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 10 Apr 2010 02:50:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-13"}

I assume a simple power-law relationship between\ngalaxy mass and BH mass, as implied by BH mass measurements at low redshift,\nand consider only evolution in the zero-point of the relation. I argue that one\ncan obtain a lower limit on the zero-point evolution by assuming that every\ngalaxy hosts a BH, shining at its Eddington rate. One can obtain an upper limit\nby requiring that the number of massive BH at high redshift does not exceed\nthat observed locally. I find that, under these assumptions, and neglecting\nscatter in the BH-galaxy mass relation, BH must have been a factor of about 2\ntimes larger at z=1 and 5 to 6 times more massive relative to their host\ngalaxies at z=2. However, accounting for intrinsic scatter in the BH-galaxy\nmass relationship considerably relaxes these constraints. With a logarithmic\nscatter of 0.3 to 0.5 dex in black hole mass at fixed galaxy mass, similar to\nestimates of the intrinsic scatter in the observed relation today, there are\nenough massive BH to produce the observed population of luminous QSOs at z=2\neven in the absence of any zero-point evolution. Adopting more realistic\nestimates for the fraction of galaxies that host active BH and the Eddington\nratios of the associated quasars, I find that the zero-point of the BH-galaxy\nmass relation at z=2 cannot be much more than a factor of two times larger than\nthe present-day value, as the number of luminous quasars predicted would exceed\nthe observed population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Aug 2009 18:26:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Regarding the\ncompanion star, observational evidence supports the idea that winds of hot\nstars are formed by clumps. Then, these inhomogeneities may interact with the\njets producing a flaring activity. In the present contribution we study the\ninteraction between a jet and a clump of the stellar wind in a high-mass\nmicroquasar. This interaction produces a shock in the jet, where particles may\nbe accelerated up to relativistic energies. We calculate the spectral energy\ndistributions of the dominant non-thermal processes: synchrotron radiation,\ninverse Compton scattering, and proton-proton collisions. Significant levels of\nX- and gamma-ray emission are predicted, with luminosities in the different\ndomains up to ~ 10^{34} - 10^{35} erg/s on a timescale of about ~ 1 h. Finally,\njet-clump interactions in high-mass microquasars could be detectable at high\nenergies. These phenomena may be behind the fast TeV variability found in some\nhigh-mass X-ray binary systems, such as Cygnus X-1, LS 5039 and LS I+61 303. In\naddition, our model can help to derive information on the properties of jets\nand clumpy winds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Aug 2009 18:53:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-07"}

The afterglow is detected in\ni,J,H,K observations starting 2.3 hr after the burst with K=19.59+/-0.16 mag\nand i=23.79+/-0.07 mag, but is absent in images obtained 1.3 years later.\nFading is also detected in the K-band between 2.8 and 3.7 hr at a 4-sigma\nsignificance level. The optical/near-IR spectral index, beta_{O,NIR}=-2, is\nmuch redder than expected in the standard afterglow model, pointing to either\nsignificant dust extinction, A_{V,host}~2 mag, or a non-afterglow origin for\nthe near-IR emission. The case for extinction is supported by a shallow optical\nto X-ray spectral index, consistent with the definition for ``dark bursts'',\nand a normal near-IR to X-ray spectral index. Moreover, a comparison to the\noptical discovery magnitudes of all short GRBs with optical afterglows\nindicates that the near-IR counterpart of GRB070724A is one of the brightest to\ndate, while its observed optical emission is one of the faintest. In the\ncontext of a non-afterglow origin, the near-IR emission may be dominated by a\nmini-supernova, leading to an estimated ejected mass of M~10^-4 Msun and a\nradioactive energy release efficiency of f~0.005 (for v~0.3c). However, the\nmini-SN model predicts a spectral peak in the UV rather than near-IR,\nsuggesting that this is either not the correct interpretation or that the\nmini-SN models need to be revised. Finally, the afterglow coincides with a star\nforming galaxy at z=0.457, previously identified as the host based on its\ncoincidence with the X-ray afterglow position (~2\" radius). Our discovery of\nthe optical/near-IR afterglow makes this association secure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2009 15:42:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The first is characterized by\na strong wavelength dependency and a constant position angle (68.6+/-0.3\ndegrees), which is parallel to the local spiral arm of the host galaxy. The\nsecond shows a completely different position angle (151.3+/-0.4) and displays a\nmild but statistically significant evolution between the two epochs. While the\nformer is identified as arising in the interstellar dust associated with\nNGC300, the latter is most likely due to continuum polarization by dust\nscattering in the circumstellar environment. No line depolarization is detected\nin correspondence of the most intense emission lines, disfavoring electron\nscattering as the source of intrinsic polarization. This implies a very small\ndeviation from symmetry in the continuum-forming region. Given the observed\nlevel of intrinsic polarization, the transient must be surrounded by a\nsignificant amount of dust (>4x10^-5 Msun), asymmetrically distributed within a\nfew thousand AU.

All SPS models rely on calibrations of T_eff, logg and\n[Fe/H] scales, which are implicit in stellar models, isochrones and synthetic\nspectra, and are explicitly adopted for empirical spectral libraries. We assess\nthe effect of a mismatch in scales between isochrones and spectral libraries\n(the two key components of SPS models) and quantify the effects on 23 commonly\nused diagnostic line indices. We find that typical systematic offsets of 100K\nin T_eff, 0.15 dex in [Fe/H] and/or 0.25 dex in logg significantly alter\ninferred absolute ages of simple stellar populations (SSPs) and that in some\ncircumstances, relative ages also change. Offsets in T_eff, logg and [Fe/H]\nscales for a scaled-solar SSP produce deviations from the model which can mimic\nthe effects of altering abundance ratios to non-scaled-solar chemical\ncompositions, and could also be spuriously interpreted as evidence for a more\ncomplex population, especially when multiple-index or full-SED fitting methods\nare used.

Based on the ratio of aromatic to star-formation IR (SFIR)\nluminosities for normal star-forming galaxies at z~1, we have constructed the\nSFIR luminosity function (LF) of z~1 quasars. As we found earlier for\nlow-redshift PG quasars, these z~1 quasars show a flatter SFIR LF than do z~1\nfield galaxies, implying the quasar host galaxy population has on average a\nhigher SFR than the field galaxies do. As measured from their SFIR LF,\nindividual quasar hosts have on average LIRG-level SFRs, which mainly arise in\nthe circumnuclear regions. By comparing with similar measurements of\nlow-redshift PG quasars, we find that the comoving SFIR luminosity density in\nquasar hosts shows a much larger increase with redshift than that in field\ngalaxies. The behavior is consistent with pure density evolution since the\naverage SFR and the average SFR/BH-accretion-rate in quasar hosts show little\nevolution with redshift. For individual quasars, we have found a correlation\nbetween the aromatic-based SFR and the luminosity of the nuclear radiation,\nconsistent with predictions of some theoretical models. We propose that type 1\nquasars reside in a distinct galaxy population that shows elliptical morphology\nbut that harbors a significant fraction of intermediate-age stars and is\nexperiencing intense circumnuclear star formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Aug 2009 20:32:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-19"}

In this\nensemble fluctuations in a granular system near jamming are controlled by a\ntemperature-like parameter, the angoricity, which is conjugate to the stress of\nthe system. In this paper, we develop a model for slowly driven granular\nmaterials based on the stress ensemble and the idea of a landscape in stress\nspace. The idea of an activated process driven by the angoricity has been shown\nby Behringer et al (2008) to describe the logarithmic strengthening of granular\nmaterials. Just as in the Soft Glassy Rheology (SGR) picture, our model\nrepresents the evolution of a small patch of granular material (a mesoscopic\nregion) in a stress-based trap landscape. The angoricity plays the role of the\nfluctuation temperature in SGR. We determine (a) the constitutive equation, (b)\nthe yield stress, and (c) the distribution of stress dissipated during granular\nshearing experiments, and compare these predictions to experiments of Hartley &\nBehringer (2003).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Aug 2009 23:21:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-15"}

However, supporting a MANET is a cost-intensive activity\nfor a mobile node. From a single mobile node perspective, the detection of\nroutes as well as forwarding packets consume local CPU time, memory,\nnetwork-bandwidth, and last but not least energy. We believe that this is one\nof the main factors that strongly motivate a mobile node to deny packet\nforwarding for others, while at the same time use their services to deliver its\nown data.

The calculations are based on three-dimensional\nhydrodynamical models which incorporate gravity, the driving of the winds,\norbital motion of the stars, and radiative cooling of the shocked plasma. The\nthermal emission arises from the stellar winds and the region where they\ncollide. We investigate the flux and spectrum from a variety of models as a\nfunction of orbital phase and orientation of the observer, and compare to the\nsingle star case. The emission from the wind-wind collision region (WCR) is\nstrongly dependent on its density and temperature, being optically thick in\nradiative systems, and optically thin in adiabatic systems. The flux from\nsystems where the WCR is highly radiative, as investigated for the first time\nin this work, can be over an order of magnitude greater than the combined flux\nfrom identically typed single stars. This excess occurs over a broad range of\nwavelengths from cm to sub-mm. In contrast, when the WCR is largely adiabatic,\na significant excess in the thermal flux occurs only below 100 GHz. Eccentric\nsystems may show order of magnitude or greater flux variability, especially if\nthe plasma in the WCR transitions from an adiabatic to a radiative state and\nvice-versa - in such cases the flux can display significant hysteresis with\nstellar separation.

The Konkoly Blazhko Survey (KBS) was initiated in 2004.\nSince then more than 750 nights of observation have been devoted to this\nproject. A sample of 30 RRab stars was extensively observed, and light-curve\nmodulation was detected in 14 cases. The 47% occurrence rate of the modulation\nis much larger than any previous estimate. The significant increase of the\ndetected incidence rate is mostly due to the discovery of small-amplitude\nmodulation. Half of the Blazhko variables in our sample show modulation with so\nsmall amplitude that definitely have been missed in the previous surveys. We\nhave found that the modulation can be very unstable in some cases, e.g. RY Com\nshowed regular modulation only during one part of the observations while during\ntwo seasons it had stable light curve with abrupt, small changes in the\npulsation amplitude. This type of light-curve variability is also hard to\ndetect in other Survey's data. The larger frequency of the light-curve\nmodulation of RRab stars makes it even more important to find the still lacking\nexplanation of the Blazhko phenomenon. The validity of the [Fe/H](P,phi_{31})\nrelation using the mean light curves of Blazhko variables is checked in our\nsample. We have found that the formula gives accurate result for\nsmall-modulation-amplitude Blazhko stars, and this is also the case for\nlarge-modulation-amplitude stars if the light curve has complete phase\ncoverage. However, if the data of large-modulation-amplitude Blazhko stars are\nnot extended enough (e.g. < 500 data points from < 15 nights), the formula may\ngive false result due to the distorted shape of the mean light curve used.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2009 10:18:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Moreover, the base state contains sufficient detail such that it\nallows for instability due to a viscosity-contrast mechanism (which turns out\nto be dominant) as well as instability due to a critical-layer-type mechanism,\nand it is validated against the experimental and numerical data available in\nthe literature. Furthermore, the effect of perturbations in the turbulent\nstress distributions is investigated, and demonstrated, for the first time, to\nbe small for cases wherein the liquid layer is thin.

Such antenna configuration facilitates capturing the\ninherent diversity gain due to independent signal dispersion by the target\nscatterers. We consider a new MIMO radar framework for detecting a target that\nlies in an unknown location. This is in contrast with conventional MIMO radars\nwhich break the space into small cells and aim at detecting the presence of a\ntarget in a specified cell. We treat this problem through offering a novel\ncomposite hypothesis testing framework for target detection when (i) one or\nmore parameters of the target are unknown and we are interested in estimating\nthem, and (ii) only a finite number of observations are available. The test\noffered optimizes a metric which accounts for both detection and estimation\naccuracies. In this paper as the parameter of interest we focus on the vector\nof time-delays that the waveforms undergo from being emitted by the transmit\nantennas until being observed by the receive antennas. The analytical and\nempirical results establish that for the proposed joint target detection and\ntime-delay estimation framework, MIMO radars exhibit significant gains over\nphased-array radars for extended targets which consist of multiple independent\nscatterers. For point targets modeled as single scatterers, however, the\ndetection/estimation accuracies of MIMO and phased-array radars for this\nspecific setup (joint target detection and time-delay estimation) are\ncomparable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2009 15:28:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}

Chem. Phys. 128,154510 (2008)], whether the residual entropy is real\nor fictional. It is shown that the residual entropy loss conjecture (ELC) at\nthe glass transition, which results in a discontinuous entropy violates many\nfundamental principles of classical thermodynamics, and also contradicts some\nexperimental facts. Assuming, as is common in the field, that glasses are in\ninternal equilibrium, we show that the continuity of enthalpy and volume at the\nglass transition require the continuity of the Gibbs free energy and the\nentropy, which contradicts ELC. It is then argued that ELC is founded on an\nincorrect understanding of what it means for a glass to be kinetically trapped\nin a basin and of the concept of probability and entropy. Once this\nmisunderstanding is corrected in our approach by the proper identification of\nentropy as the ensemble entropy, which is in accordance with the principle of\nreproducibility (see Sect. II), it follows immediately that the residual\nentropy does not disappear in a kinetically frozen glassy state and all the\nviolations of thermodynamics disappear. We show that the temporal definition of\nentropy over finite times does not make sense for glasses as it is not unique.\nThere is no loss of ergodicity and causality, contrary to some recent claims.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2009 15:30:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-10"}

This\n\"doublet-extended standard model\" adds a weak doublet of fermions (including a\nheavy partner of the top quark) to the particle content of the standard model\nin order to implement an O(4) x U(1)_X = SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R x P_{LR} x U(1)_X\nsymmetry that protects the Zbb coupling. This symmetry is softly broken to the\ngauged SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y electroweak symmetry by a Dirac mass M for the new\ndoublet; adjusting the value of M allows us to explore the range of\npossibilities between the O(4)-symmetric (M to 0) and standard-model-like (M to\ninfinity) limits. In this simple model, we find that the experimental limits on\nthe Zbb coupling favor smaller M while the presence of a potentially sizable\nnegative contribution to T strongly favors large M. A fit to all precision\nelectroweak data shows that the heavy partner of the top quark must be heavier\nthan about 3.4 TeV, making it difficult to search for at LHC. This result\ndemonstrates that electroweak data strongly limits the amount by which the\ncustodial symmetry of the top-quark mass generating sector can be enhanced\nrelative to the standard model. Using an effective field theory calculation, we\nillustrate how the leading contributions to alpha T, alpha S and the Zbb\ncoupling in this model arise from an effective operator coupling right-handed\ntop-quarks to the Z-boson, and how the effects on these observables are\ncorrelated. We contrast this toy model with extra-dimensional models in which\nthe extended custodial symmetry is invoked to control the size of additional\ncontributions to alpha T and the Zbb coupling, while leaving the standard model\ncontributions essentially unchanged.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2009 15:58:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2009 12:53:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2009 17:32:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2009 11:57:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}
