This paper\ndetails high resolution Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations\ninvestigating the influence of stellar encounters on disc dynamics. Star-star\nencounters (where the primary has a self-gravitating, marginally stable\nprotostellar disc, and the secondary has no disc) were simulated with various\norbital parameters to investigate the resulting disc structure and dynamics.\nThis work is the first of its kind to incorporate realistic radiative transfer\ntechniques to realistically model the resulting thermodynamics.\n  The results suggest that the effect of stellar encounters is to prohibit\nfragmentation - compressive and shock heating stabilises the disc, and the\nradiative cooling is insufficient to trigger gravitational instability. The\nencounter strips the outer regions of the disc (either through tidal tails or\nby capture of matter to form a disc around the secondary), which triggers a\nreadjustment of the primary disc to a steeper surface density profile (and a\nflatter Toomre Q profile). The disc around the secondary plays a role in the\npotential capture of the secondary to form a binary. However, this applies only\nto orbits that are parabolic - hyperbolic encounters do not form a secondary\ndisc, and are not captured.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Aug 2009 16:43:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

For charmonia, finite-$T$ potential models\ncould be used to extrapolate color-screening effects to finite $\\mu_q$ to\nfacilitate a quantitative evaluation of dissociation rates in the medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Aug 2009 23:12:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

Although we make three saccades per second at the eyeball's\nmaximum speed of 700 deg/sec, our visual system accounts for these incisive eye\nmovements to produce a stable percept of the world. This visual constancy is\nmaintained by neuronal receptive field shifts in various retinotopically\norganized cortical areas prior to saccade onset, giving the brain access to\nvisual information from the saccade's target before the eyes' arrival. It\nintegrates visual information acquisition across saccades. Our modeling\nutilizes basic properties of PFT. First, PFT is computable by FFT in complex\nlogarithmic coordinates that approximate the retinotopy. Second, a translation\nin retinotopic (logarithmic) coordinates, modeled by the shift property of the\nFourier transform, remaps the presaccadic scene into a postsaccadic reference\nframe.

We propose\nan amplitude-phase representation of the DT-CWT which, among other things,\noffers a direct explanation for the improvement in the shift-invariance. The\nrepresentation is based on the shifting action of the group of fractional\nHilbert transform (fHT) operators, which extends the notion of arbitrary\nphase-shifts from sinusoids to finite-energy signals (wavelets in particular).\nIn particular, we characterize the shiftability of the DT-CWT in terms of the\nshifting property of the fHTs. At the heart of the representation are certain\nfundamental invariances of the fHT group, namely that of translation, dilation,\nand norm, which play a decisive role in establishing the key properties of the\ntransform. It turns out that these fundamental invariances are exclusive to\nthis group.\n  Next, by introducing a generalization of the Bedrosian theorem for the fHT\noperator, we derive an explicitly understanding of the shifting action of the\nfHT for the particular family of wavelets obtained through the modulation of\nlowpass functions (e.g., the Shannon and Gabor wavelet). This, in effect, links\nthe corresponding dual-tree transform with the framework of windowed-Fourier\nanalysis. Finally, we extend these ideas to the multi-dimensional setting by\nintroducing a directional extension of the fHT, the fractional directional\nHilbert transform. In particular, we derive a signal representation involving\nthe superposition of direction-selective wavelets with appropriate\nphase-shifts, which helps explain the improved shift-invariance of the\ntransform along certain preferential directions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2009 15:18:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-23"}

The right tails of response\nlatency distributions have received little attention in experimental\npsychology. This is because such very long latencies have traditionally been\nconsidered irrelevant for psychological processes, instead, they are expected\nto reflect `contingent' neural events unrelated to the experimental question.\nMost current theories predict the right tail of response latency distributions\nto decrease exponentially. In consequence, current standard practice recommends\ndiscarding very long response latencies as `outliers'. Here, I show that the\nright tails of response latency distributions always follow a power-law with a\nslope of exactly two. This entails that the very late responses cannot be\nconsidered outliers.

Through a\nrigorous analysis, we show that rank-based attachment models lead to graphs\nwith a power law degree distribution with exponent 1+1/a whenever vertices are\nranked according to their degree, their age, or a randomly chosen fitness\nvalue. We also investigate the case where the ranking is based on the initial\nrank of each vertex; the rank of existing vertices only changes to accommodate\nthe new vertex.

Both passive\nheating of the inner collapsing envelope by the protostellar luminosity as well\nas active heating by shocks and by UV associated with the outflows or accretion\nhave been proposed. We aim to characterize the warm gas within protosteller\nobjects, and disentangle contributions from the (inner) envelope, bipolar\noutflows and the quiescent cloud. High-J CO maps (12CO J=6--5 and 7--6) of the\nimmediate surroundings (up to 10,000 AU) of eight low-mass YSOs are obtained\nwith the CHAMP+ 650/850 GHz array receiver mounted on the APEX telescope. In\naddition, isotopologue observations of the 13CO J=6--5 transition and [C I]\n3P_2-3P_1 line were taken. Strong quiescent narrow-line 12CO 6--5 and 7--6\nemission is seen toward all protostars. In the case of HH~46 and Ced 110 IRS 4,\nthe on-source emission originates in material heated by UV photons scattered in\nthe outflow cavity and not just by passive heating in the inner envelope. Warm\nquiescent gas is also present along the outflows, heated by UV photons from\nshocks. Shock-heated warm gas is only detected for Class 0 flows and the more\nmassive Class I sources such as HH~46. Outflow temperatures, estimated from the\nCO 6--5 and 3--2 line wings, are ~100 K, close to model predictions, with the\nexception of the L~1551 IRS 5 and IRAS 12496-7650, for which temperatures <50 K\nare found. APEX-CHAMP+ is uniquely suited to directly probe a protostar's\nfeedback on its accreting envelope gas in terms of heating, photodissociation,\nand outflow dispersal by mapping 1'x1' regions in high-J CO and [C I] lines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2009 14:35:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Starting from the concept of recurrences in\nphase space, the recurrence matrix of a time series is interpreted as the\nadjacency matrix of an associated complex network which links different points\nin time if the evolution of the considered states is very similar. A critical\ncomparison of these recurrence networks with similar existing techniques is\npresented, revealing strong conceptual benefits of the new approach which can\nbe considered as a unifying framework for transforming time series into complex\nnetworks that also includes other methods as special cases.\n  It is demonstrated that there are fundamental relationships between the\ntopological properties of recurrence networks and the statistical properties of\nthe phase space density of the underlying dynamical system. Hence, the network\ndescription yields new quantitative characteristics of the dynamical complexity\nof a time series, which substantially complement existing measures of\nrecurrence quantification analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2009 14:27:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-03"}

Rather, either a small\nfraction of the corona escapes to infinity, or the ejection velocity of the\ncorona is vanishingly low.
