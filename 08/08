At the instant\nthe measurement is made, the wave function irrevocably collapses to a new state\n(erasing some of the past quantum information) and continues from thereon in\nthat state till changed by a unitary operation or a new measurement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2009 17:43:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-10"}

To quantify this behavior we\nuse the recently introduced notion of network harness. It is described by the\nharness distribution P(r,s): the number of sequences of s consecutive stations\nthat are serviced by r parallel routes. For certain PTNs that we have analyzed\nwe observe that the harness distribution may be described by power laws. These\npower laws observed indicate a certain level of organization and planning which\nmay be driven by the need to minimize the costs of infrastructure and secondly\nby the fact that points of interest tend to be clustered in certain locations\nof a city. This effect may be seen as a result of the strong interdependence of\nthe evolutions of both the city and its PTN.\n  To further investigate the significance of the empirical results we have\nstudied one- and two-dimensional models of randomly placed routes modeled by\ndifferent types of walks. While in one dimension an analytic treatment was\nsuccessful, the two dimensional case was studied by simulations showing that\nthe empirical results for real PTNs deviate significantly from those expected\nfor randomly placed routes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2009 16:08:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

An even more prominent deviation has been observed in the fraction of\ncosmic ray positrons around 100 GeV energies. In this paper we show that the\nobserved excesses in the electron spectrum may be easily re-produced without\ninvoking any unusual sources other than the general diffuse Galactic components\nof cosmic rays. The primary physical effect involved is the Klein-Nishina\nsuppression of the electron cooling rate around TeV energies. With a very\nreasonable choice of the model parameters characterizing the local interstellar\nmedium, we can reproduce the most recent observations by Fermi and HESS\nexperiments. We also find that high positron fraction increasing with energy,\nas claimed by the PAMELA experiment, cannot be explained in our model with the\nconservative set of the model parameters. We are able, however, to reproduce\nthe PAMELA results assuming high values of the starlight and interstellar gas\ndensities, which would be more appropriate for vicinities of supernova\nremnants. A possible solution to this problem may be that cosmic rays undergo\nmost of their interactions near their sources due to the efficient trapping in\nthe far upstream of supernova shocks by self-generated, cosmic ray-driven\nturbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2009 18:10:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 2009 17:15:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

We present a\ncomprehensive, systematic analysis of Suzaku and XMM-Newton spectra of 10\nneutron star low-mass X-ray binaries, all of which display broad Fe K emission\nlines. Of the 10 sources, 4 are Z sources, 4 are atolls and 2 are accreting\nmillisecond X-ray pulsars (also atolls). The Fe K lines are well fit by a\nrelativistic line model for a Schwarzschild metric, and imply a narrow range of\ninner disk radii (6 - 15 GM/c^2) in most cases. This implies that the accretion\ndisk extends close to the neutron star surface over a range of luminosities.\nContinuum modeling shows that for the majority of observations, a blackbody\ncomponent (plausibly associated with the boundary layer) dominates the X-ray\nemission from 8 - 20 keV. Thus it appears likely that this spectral component\nproduces the majority of the ionizing flux that illuminates the accretion disk.\nTherefore, we also fit the spectra with a blurred reflection model, wherein a\nblackbody component illuminates the disk.

Of particular interest is the characterisation,\nlocation, and evolution of \"transport barriers\" in the flow, i.e. material\ncurves and surfaces. We argue that a general theory of Lagrangian transport has\nto account for the effects of transient flow phenomena which are not captured\nby the infinite-time notions of hyperbolicity even for flows defined for all\ntime.

Its radio jet, the largest detected so far, emits strongly\npolarized synchrotron radiation and can be traced all the way from the galactic\nnucleus to the hot spot located ~440 kpc away. This jet emanates from an\nextremely massive black-hole (mass > 10^9 times solar mass) and forms a\nstrikingly compact radio lobe. To a surface brightness contrast of at least 20\nno radio lobe is detected on the side of the counter-jet, which is similar to\nthe main jet in brightness upto the scale of tens of kpc. Thus, contrary to the\nnearly universal trend, the brightness asymmetry in this radio galaxy increases\nwith distance from the nucleus. With several unusual properties, including a\npredominantly toroidal magnetic field, this Fanaroff-Riley type II (FR-II)\nmega-jet is an exceptionally useful laboratory for testing the role of magnetic\nfield in jet stabilization and radio lobe formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Aug 2009 07:24:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-11"}
