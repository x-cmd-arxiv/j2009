The connection between these two descriptions is a classic topic in\nmathematical physics. One direction was solved by the now famous result due to\nLindblad, Kossakowski Gorini and Sudarshan, who gave a complete\ncharacterisation of the master equations that generate completely positive\nsemi-groups. However, the other direction has remained open: given a CPT map,\nis there a Lindblad master equation that generates it (and if so, can we find\nit's form)? This is sometimes known as the Markovianity problem. Physically, it\nis asking how one can deduce underlying physical processes from experimental\nobservations.\n  We give a complexity theoretic answer to this problem: it is NP-hard. We also\ngive an explicit algorithm that reduces the problem to integer semi-definite\nprogramming, a well-known NP problem. Together, these results imply that\nresolving the question of which CPT maps can be generated by master equations\nis tantamount to solving P=NP: any efficiently computable criterion for\nMarkovianity would imply P=NP; whereas a proof that P=NP would imply that our\nalgorithm already gives an efficiently computable criterion. Thus, unless P\ndoes equal NP, there cannot exist any simple criterion for determining when a\nCPT map has a master equation description.\n  However, we also show that if the system dimension is fixed (relevant for\ncurrent quantum process tomography experiments), then our algorithm scales\nefficiently in the required precision, allowing an underlying Lindblad master\nequation to be determined efficiently from even a single snapshot in this case.\n  Our work also leads to similar complexity-theoretic answers to a related\nlong-standing open problem in probability theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2009 15:51:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2011 12:46:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-22"}

This challenges theoretical models that aim at describing both\nthe radio and the X-ray fluxes in terms of radiative emission from a\nrelativistic jet. More generally, it opens important questions on how similar\naccretion flows can produce substantially different outflows. Here we present a\npossible explanation for this phenomenon, based on the strong dependency of the\njet spectral energy distribution on the magnetic field strength, and on the\nidea that the strength of the jet magnetic field varies from source to source.\nBecause of the effect of radiative losses, sources with stronger jet magnetic\nfield values would have lower radio emission. We discuss the implications of\nthis scenario, the main one being that the radio flux does not necessarily\nprovide a direct measure of the jet power. We further discuss how a variable\njet magnetic field, reaching a critical value, can qualitatively explain the\nobserved spectral transition out of the hard state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2009 11:11:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The CoRoT short runs give us the opportunity to observe a large\nvariety of late-type stars through their solar-like oscillations.

Our aim is to identify the most efficient tools to\nextract as much information as possible from the power density spectrum.\nMethods. The most productive method appears to be the autocorrelation of the\ntime series, calculated as the spectrum of the filtered spectrum.

This situation is dual to bulk solutions containing two\ndisconnected horizons which remain to be constructed. Here perturbations lead\nto heat exchange at a level typical of confined phases, even when T_H remains\nfar above any deconfinement transition.

This result allows the\nextension of the Zelterman estimator by means of logistic regression to include\nobserved heterogeneity in the form of covariates. We also review an estimator\nproposed by Chao and explain why we are not able to obtain similar results for\nthis estimator. The Zelterman estimator is applied in two case studies, the\nfirst a drug user study from Bangkok, the second an illegal immigrant study in\nthe Netherlands. Our results suggest the new estimator should be used, in\nparticular, if substantial unobserved heterogeneity is present.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2009 07:35:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-18"}

Many efforts have been made to understand the physics of\ntheir luminous infrared emission and evolutionary stages. However, a large\nULIRG sample is still needed to study the properties of their central black\nholes (BHs), the BH-host galaxy relation, and their evolution. We identified\n308 ULIRGs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 6, and classified\nthem into the NL ULIRGs (with only narrow emission lines) and the Type I ULIRGs\n(with broad emission lines). About 56% of ULIRGs in our total sample show\ninteraction features, and this percentage is 79% for redshift z < 0.2. Optical\nidentifications of these ULIRGs show that the AGN percentage is at least 49%,\nand the percentage increases with the infrared luminosity. We found 62 Type I\nULIRGs, and estimated their BH masses and velocity dispersions from their\noptical spectra. Together with known Type I ULIRGs in the literature, a sample\nof 90 Type I ULIRGs enables us to make a statistical study. We found that the\nBH masses of Type I ULIRGs are typically smaller than those of PG QSOs, and\nmost Type I ULIRGs follow the M_{BH}-sigma relation. However, some ULIRGs with\nlarger Eddington ratio deviate from this relation, even the line width of the\n[OIII] narrow line (NL) core or the [SII] line was used as the surrogate of\nvelocity dispersion. This implies that at least some ULIRGs are probably still\nin the early evolution stage toward QSOs. The anti-correlation between the mass\ndeviation from the M_{BH}-sigma relation and the Eddington ratio supports that\nthe evolution of Type I ULIRGs is probably followed by the building up of the\nM_{BH}-sigma relation and the evolution to the QSO phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2009 07:54:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 2009 07:59:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 26 Sep 2009 13:34:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-26"}

Such\n``benefit-only'' methods ignore the considerable differences among the sickness\nindicators in cost of data collection, an issue that is crucial when admission\nsickness is used to drive programs (now implemented or under consideration in\nseveral countries, including the U.S. and U.K.) that attempt to identify\nsubstandard hospitals by comparing observed and expected mortality rates (given\nadmission sickness). When both data-collection cost and accuracy of prediction\nof 30-day mortality are considered, a large variable-selection problem arises\nin which costly variables that do not predict well enough should be omitted\nfrom the final scale.

However, British physicist E.\nA. Milne pointed in 1943 that the same equation could be deduced simply based\non the Newtonian theory of gravity. It means that the Friedmann equation, in\nstead of the motion equation of relativity, is actually the Newtonian one in\nessence. The reason is that two simplified conditions are used in the deduction\nof the Friedmann equation. One is the Robertson-Walker metric and another is\nstatic energy momentum tensor. It is proved that in light of the R-W metric,\nthe velocity of light emitted by celestial bodies in the expansive universe\nwould satisfy the Galileo's addition rule. So what the R-W metric describes is\nunsuitable to be taken as the space-time structure of relativity cosmology. On\nthe other hand, because there are relative velocities between observer and\nmaterial in the expensive universe actually, we should consider dynamic energy\nmomentum tensor in cosmology. The Friedmann equations need relativity revision.\nIn this way, some deductions of current cosmology, such as the values of Hubble\nconstant, dark material and dark energy densities and so on, should be\nre-estimated. The possible form of relativity metric for cosmology is proposed\nat last. It is proved strictly based on the Einstein's equation of gravity that\nthe space-time of the expansive universe can not be flat. In this way, by\nestablishing cosmology on the really rational foundation of relativity, we may\nget rid of the current puzzle situation of cosmology thoroughly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2009 11:44:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2009 06:43:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2010 06:26:56 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2010 08:40:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-31"}

Beyond the semiclassical approximation\nthe thermal nature of the spectrum does not change but the temperature\nundergoes some higher order corrections.

We then add simulated absorption from the high-redshift\nIGM to these quasar spectra in order to determine the corresponding\nuncertainties in reionization constraints using current and future samples of z\n> 6 quasar spectra. We find that, if the redshift of the Lyman-alpha emission\nline is presumed to coincide with the systemic redshift determined from metal\nlines, the inferred IGM neutral fraction is systematically biased to low values\ndue to a systematic blueshift of the Lyman-alpha line relative to the metal\nlines. If a similar blueshift persists in quasars at z > 6, this bias\nstrengthens previous claims of a significant neutral hydrogen fraction at z ~\n6. This technique is capable of making a robust distinction between a highly\nionized (x_IGM ~ 10^-3) and a neutral (x_IGM = 1) IGM with even a few bright\nquasars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2009 15:49:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-25"}

In order to perform their\nfunction, most of them need energy, e.g. either in the form of a photon, like\nin the case of the visual pigment rhodopsin, or through the breaking of a\nchemical bond, as in the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Such energy,\nin turn, has to be transmitted to specific locations, often several tens of\nAngstroms away from where it is initially released. Here we show, within the\nframework of a coarse-grained nonlinear network model, that energy in a protein\ncan jump from site to site with high yields, covering in many instances\nremarkably large distances. Following single-site excitations, few specific\nsites are targeted, systematically within the stiffest regions. Such energy\ntransfers mark the spontaneous formation of a localized mode of nonlinear\norigin at the destination site, which acts as an efficient energy-accumulating\ncentre. Interestingly, yields are found to be optimum for excitation energies\nin the range of biologically relevant ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2009 15:59:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
