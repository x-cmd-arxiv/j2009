Here we\nprovide step by step imaging through scanning tunneling spectroscopy of a 2-D\nsystem of vortices up to the melting transition in a focused-ion-beam\nnanodeposited W-based superconducting thin film. We show directly the\ntransition into an isotropic liquid below the superconducting critical\ntemperature. Before that, we find a hexatic phase, characterized by the\nappearance of free dislocations, and a smectic-like phase, possibly originated\nthrough partial disclination unbinding. These results represent a significant\nstep in the understanding of melting of 2-D systems, with impact across several\nresearch fields, such as liquid crystal molecules, or lipids in membranes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Aug 2009 19:30:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The effect is\nmainly driven by the change in density and gravitational potential in inner\nregions of cluster, and it is larger in lower mass systems where gas cooling\nand star formation are more efficient.

We have examined the model for\nelectronic densities well away 1/2 filling, thereby avoiding the physics of a\nMott insulator. Several recent studies have made clear that the combined\neffects of electronic interactions and spatial disorder can give rise to a\nsuppression of the electronic density of states, and a subsequent\nmetal-insulator transition can occur. We augment such studies by calculating\nthe ac conductivity for such systems.

However, with a large enough disorder strength and\nlarger interactions the density of states at the Fermi level and the\nlow-frequency conductivity are both suppressed, the conductivity becomes\nnon-Drude-like, and these phenomena are accompanied by the presence of local\nmagnetic moments.

As a consequence the total radiative energy loss rate of single\nelectrons exhibits sudden drops in the overall energy loss rate ~ gamma ^2 -\ndependence when the electron energy reaches the critical Klein-Nishina energy.\nThe strength of the drop is proportional to the energy density of the photon\nradiation field. The diffuse galactic optical photon fields from stars of\nspectral type B and G-K lead to critical Klein-Nishina energies of 40 and 161\nGeV, respectively. Associated with the drop in the loss rate are sudden\nincreases (Klein-Nishina steps) in the equilibrium spectrum of cosmic ray\nelectrons. Because the radiative loss rate of electrons is the main ingredient\nin any transport model of high-energy cosmic ray electrons, Klein-Nishina steps\nwill modify any calculated electron equilibrium spectrum irrespective of the\nelectron sources and spatial transport mode. To delineate most clearly the\nconsequences of the Klein-Nishina drops in the radiative loss rate, we chose as\nillustrative example the simplest realistic model for cosmic ray electron\ndynamics in the Galaxy, consisting of the competition of radiative losses and\nsecondary production by inelastic hadron-hadron collisions.

In particular, we\ngeneralize existing approaches to distinguish between chemical potentials of\nparticles and their superpartners. This allows us to test the assumption of\nsuperequilibrium (equal chemical potentials for particles and sparticles) that\nhas usually been made in earlier studies. We show that in the Minimal\nSupersymmetric Standard Model, superequilibrium is generically maintained --\neven in the absence of fast supergauge interactions -- due to the presence of\nYukawa interactions. We provide both analytic arguments as well as illustrative\nnumerical examples. We also extend the latter to regions where analytical\napproximations are not available since down-type Yukawa couplings or supergauge\ninteractions only incompletely equilibrate. We further comment on cases of\nbroken superequilibrium wherein a heavy superpartner decouples from the\nelectroweak plasma, causing a kinematic bottleneck in the chain of\nequilibrating reactions. Such situations may be relevant for baryogenesis\nwithin extensions of the MSSM. We also provide a compendium of inputs required\nto characterize the symmetric phase transport dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Aug 2009 14:57:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-30"}

While\nboundary data are supposed to be smooth, initial conditions can contain\ndistributions of any order of singularity. It is known that such problems have\na unique continuous solution if the initial data are continuous. In the case of\nstrongly singular initial data we prove the existence of a (unique) delta wave\nsolution. In both cases, we say that a solution is smoothing if it eventually\nbecomes $k$-times continuously differentiable for each $k$. Our main result is\na criterion allowing us to determine whether or not the solution is smoothing.\nIn particular, we prove a rather general smoothingness result in the case of\nclassical boundary conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Aug 2009 15:33:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2010 08:19:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 3 Aug 2010 10:31:38 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2011 11:21:13 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2011 08:29:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-09"}
