The implicit initial assumptions enable correct nodes to infer\nabout the progression of the algorithm at other nodes from their local state.\nThis paper considers a more severe fault model than permanent Byzantine\nfailures, one in which the system can in addition be subject to severe\ntransient failures that can temporarily throw the system out of its assumption\nboundaries. When the system eventually returns to behave according to the\npresumed assumptions it may be in an arbitrary state in which any\nsynchronization among the nodes might be lost, and each node may be at an\narbitrary state.

In many cases, these triaxial equilibria are also\ntumbling slowly, typically about their short axes, with periods of order a\nHubble time. Halos may therefore exert a slowly changing external torque on\nspiral galaxies that can affect their dynamical evolution in interesting ways.\nWe examine the effect of the external torques exerted by a tumbling quadrupolar\ntidal field on the evolution of spiral galaxies using N-body simulations with\nrealistic, disk galaxy models. We measure the amplitude of the external\nquadrupole moments of dark halos in cosmological simulations and use these to\nforce disk galaxy models in a series of N-body experiments for a range of\npattern speeds. We find that the torques are strong enough to induce long lived\ntransient warps in disks similar to those observed in real spirals and also\ninduce the bar instability at later times in some galaxy models that are\notherwise stable for long periods of time in isolation. We also observe forced\nspiral structure near the edge of the disk where normally self-gravity is too\nweak to be responsible for such structure. This overlooked influence of dark\nhalos may well be responsible for many of the peculiar aspects of disk galaxy\ndynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Aug 2009 23:02:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

As a consequence, the asymptotic solutions\ncan be constant, periodic,quasiperiodic or almost periodic, and possibly weakly\nchaotic.

If $\\Omega$ equals one of the phonon frequencies $\\omega_\\nu$,\nit is $\\alpha=2$.

The trigger uses field-programmable gate arrays\n(FPGAs) so that it is adaptable to different observing modes and special\nphysics triggers, e.g. pulsars. The trigger consists of three levels: The level\n1 (L1.5) trigger operating on each telescope camera samples the discriminated\npixels at a rate of 400 MHz and searches for nearest-neighbor coincidences. In\nL1.5, the received discriminated signals are delay-compensated with an accuracy\nof 0.078 ns, facilitating a short coincidence time-window between any nearest\nneighbor of 5 ns. The hit pixels are then sent to a second trigger level (L2)\nthat parameterizes the image shape and transmits this information along with a\nGPS time stamp to the array-level trigger (L3) at a rate of 10 MHz via a fiber\noptic link.

The goal of the Coma survey\nwas to measure precise rotation periods for main-sequence F, G and K dwarfs in\nthis intermediate-age (~600 Myr) cluster, and to determine the extent to which\nmagnetic braking has caused the stellar spin periods to converge. We find a\ntight, almost linear relationship between rotation period and J-K colour with a\nroot-mean square scatter of only 2 percent. The relation is similar to that\nseen among F, G and K stars in the Hyades. Such strong convergence can only be\nexplained if angular momentum is not at present being transferred from a\nreservoir in the deep stellar interiors to the surface layers. We conclude that\nthe coupling timescale for angular momentum transport from a rapidly-spinning\nradiative core to the outer convective zone must be substantially shorter than\nthe cluster age, and that from the age of Coma onward, stars rotate effectively\nas solid bodies. The existence of a tight relationship between stellar mass and\nrotation period at a given age supports the use of stellar rotation period as\nan age indicator in F, G and K stars of Hyades age and older. We demonstrate\nthat individual stellar ages can be determined within the Coma population with\nan internal precision of order 9 percent (RMS), using a standard magnetic\nbraking law in which rotation period increases with the square root of stellar\nage. We find that a slight modification to the magnetic-braking power law, P\nproportional to t^0.56, yields rotational and asteroseismological ages in good\nagreement for the Sun and other stars of solar age for which p-mode studies and\nphotometric rotation periods have been published.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2009 05:44:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

These\nproblems, stemming from the Lorentz signature of space-time, are a source of\nnon-locality, which induces a spatial non-separability in relativistic quantum\nmechanics, with implications for relativistic entanglement. Then the classical\nsystem of charged particles plus the electro-magnetic field is studied in the\nframework of ADM canonical tetrad gravity in asymptotically Minkowskian\nspace-times admitting the ADM Poincare' group at spatial infinity, which allows\nto get the general relativistic extension of the non-inertial rest frames of\nspecial relativity.

This suggests the 67Hz\nQPO seen occasionally in the mildly super-Eddington BHB GRS 1915+105 as the\nmost likely counterpart, assuming mass scaling of the QPO frequency. This is\nsupported by the fact that these data from GRS 1915+105 have an energy spectrum\nwhich is also dominated by a `hot disc' component. Here we show that the\nunderlying broad band power spectral shape and normalisation are also similar,\nproviding further consistency checks for this identification. Thus the AGN QPO\nadds to the growing evidence for a simple mass scaling of the accretion flow\nproperties between stellar and supermassive black holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2009 14:49:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2009 12:17:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The star HD 87643, exhibiting the \"B[e] phenomenon\", has one of the\nmost extreme infrared excesses for this object class.

In addition, the presence of close dusty material was\ntested through a combination of multi-wavelength high spatial 5Aresolution\nobservations. Methods. We observed HD 87643 with high spatial resolution\ntechniques, using the near-IR AMBER/VLTI interferometer with baselines ranging\nfrom 60 m to 130 m and the mid-IR MIDI/VLTI interferometer with baselines\nranging from 25 m to 65 m.

A detailed analysis of VI\ncolor-magnitude diagrams of the resolved stellar population is used to measure\nproperties such as line-of-sight distance, surface brightness, metallicity, and\nage, and these are used to isolate and characterize different components of the\nM31 halo: (1) several substructures, and (2) the smooth halo. First, we study\nM31's halo substructure along the north-west/south-east minor axis out to R ~\n100 kpc and the south-west major axis region at R ~ 60 kpc. We confirm two\nsubstructures in the south-east halo reported by Ibata et al. (2007) and\ndiscover two overdense substructures in the north-west halo. We investigate the\nproperties of these four substructures as well as other structures including\nthe western shelf and find that differences in stellar populations among these\nsystems, thereby suggesting each has a different origin.

The loop\nconfigurations are represented by a pointer list in the computer and a Monte\nCarlo update scheme is proposed. Sample simulations are reported and the method\nturns out to be similarly efficient as the reflection cluster method, but it\nhas greater potential for systematic generalization to other lattice field\ntheories. A variant action suggested by the method is also simulated and leads\nto a rather extreme demonstration of the concept of universality of the scaling\nor continuum limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2009 15:58:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2009 08:10:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2010 15:51:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

Then we study the effective supersymmetric gauge\ntheory in the 7-brane wrapping 4-cycles in F-theory on local elliptic CY4s\nbased on a complex tetrahedral surface $\\mathcal{T}$ and its blown ups\n$\\mathcal{T}_{n}$.
