The expected cost measure is composed of costs\nassociated with power consumption from transmission and packet holding costs.\nThe primary application motivating this problem is wireless media streaming.\nFor this application, the buffer underflow constraints prevent the user buffers\nfrom emptying, so as to maintain playout quality. In the case of a single user\nwith linear power-rate curves, we show that a modified base-stock policy is\noptimal under the finite horizon, infinite horizon discounted, and infinite\nhorizon average expected cost criteria. For a single user with piecewise-linear\nconvex power-rate curves, we show that a finite generalized base-stock policy\nis optimal under all three expected cost criteria. We also present the\nsequences of critical numbers that complete the characterization of the optimal\ncontrol laws in each of these cases when some additional technical conditions\nare satisfied. We then analyze the structure of the optimal policy for the case\nof two users. We conclude with a discussion of methods to identify\nimplementable near-optimal policies for the most general case of M users.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 2009 18:40:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2010 00:20:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-16"}

The protocol for\nthis first problem is simple, and can be expressed with Petri net formalism. A\nsecond problem is to maximize d when m is given, and n is unknown. For the\nsecond problem, the paper presents a non-uniform protocol with a single\ncorrective process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 2009 20:52:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 10 Oct 2009 22:55:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Mixers are\nnodes that receive packets from multiple sources and change the timing of\npackets, by mixing packets at the output links, to prevent the eavesdropper\nfrom finding sources of outgoing packets.

This is the first systematic mid-IR search\nfor weak or hidden AGNs in a statistically significant sample of bulgeless disk\ngalaxies. Based on the detection of the high-ionization [NeV] line, we report\nthe discovery of an AGN in one out of the 18 galaxies in the sample. This\ngalaxy, NGC 4178, is a nearby edge-on Sd galaxy, which likely hosts a prominent\nnuclear star cluster (NSC). The bolometric luminosity of the AGN inferred from\nthe [NeV] luminosity is ~ 8e41 ergs/s. This is almost two orders of magnitude\ngreater than the luminosity of the AGN in NGC 4395, the best studied AGN in a\nbulgeless disk galaxy. Assuming that the AGN in NGC 4178 is radiating below the\nEddington limit, the lower mass limit for the black hole is ~ 6e3M_sun. The\nfact that none of the other galaxies in the sample shows any evidence for an\nAGN demonstrates that while the AGN detection rate based on mid-IR diagnostics\nis high (30-40%) in optically quiescent galaxies with pseudobulges, it drops\ndrastically in Sd/Sdm galaxies. Our observations therefore confirm that AGNs in\ncompletely bulgeless disk galaxies are not hidden in the optical but truly are\nrare. Of the three Sd galaxies with AGNs known so far, all have prominent NSCs,\nsuggesting that in the absence of a well-defined bulge, the galaxy must possess\na NSC in order to host an AGN. While the presence of a NSC appears to be a\nrequirement for hosting an AGN in bulgeless galaxies, neither the properties of\nthe NSC nor those of the host galaxy appear exceptional in late-type AGN hosts.\nThe recipe for forming and growing a central black hole in a bulgeless galaxy\ntherefore remains unknown.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2009 02:04:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

For this purpose, the Gibbs extremal conditions\nare slightly modified in order to be applied to a wide class of non-equilibrium\nstates. As usual, it is assumed that the system maximizes the entropy\nfunctional $S$, subjected to the standard conditions; i.e., constant energy and\nnormalization of the probability distribution. However, an extra conserved\nconstraint function $F$ is also assumed to exist, which forces the system to\nremain in the metastable configuration. Further, after assuming additivity for\ntwo quasi-independent subsystems, and that the new constraint commutes with\ndensity matrix $\\rho$, it is argued that F should be an homogeneous function of\nthe density matrix, at least for systems in which the spectrum is sufficiently\ndense to be considered as continuous. The explicit form of $F$ turns to be\n$F(p_{i})=p_{i}^{q}$, where $p_i$ are the eigenvalues of the density matrix and\n$q$ is a real number to be determined. This $q$ number appears as a kind of\nTsallis parameter having the interpretation of the order of homogeneity of the\nconstraint $F$. The procedure is applied to describe the results of the plasma\nexperiment of Huang and Driscoll. The experimentally measured density is\npredicted with a similar precision as it is done with the use of the extremum\nof the enstrophy and Tsallis procedures. However, the present results define\nthe density at all the radial positions. In particular, the smooth tail shown\nby the experimental distribution turns to be predicted by the procedure. In\nthis way, the scheme avoids the non-analyticity of the density profile at large\ndistances arising in both of the mentioned alternative procedures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2009 04:48:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-20"}

Future\nobservations of redshifted 21-cm radiation from the cosmological neutral\nhydrogen (HI) distribution hold the potential of probing the LSS over a large\nredshift range. We have investigated the correlation between post-reionization\nHI signal and weak lensing convergence field. Assuming that the HI follows the\ndark matter distribution, the cross-correlation angular power spectrum at a\nmultipole \\ell is found to be proportional to the cold dark matter power\nspectrum evaluated at \\ell/r, where r denotes the comoving distance to the\nredshift where the HI is located. The amplitude of the ross-correlation depends\non quantities specific to the HI distribution, growth of perturbations and also\nthe underlying cosmological model. In an ideal ituation, we found that a\nstatistically significant detection of the cross-correlation signal is\npossible. If detected, the cross-correlation signal hold the possibility of a\njoint estimation of cosmological parameters and also test various CMBR\nde-lensing estimators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2009 07:53:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2010 07:53:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-19"}

Standard modelling, using locally isothermal discs, indicate in\nthe low planet mass regime an inward (type-I) migration. Taking into account\nnon-isothermal effects, recent studies have shown that the direction of the\ntype-I migration can change from inward to outward. In this paper we extend\nprevious two-dimensional studies, and investigate the planet-disc interaction\nin viscous, radiative discs using fully three-dimensional radiation\nhydrodynamical simulations of protoplanetary accretion discs with embedded\nplanets, for a range of planetary masses.\n  We use an explicit three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamical code NIRVANA that\nincludes full tensor viscosity. We have added implicit radiation transport in\nthe flux-limited diffusion approximation, and to speed up the simulations\nsignificantly we have newly adapted and implemented the FARGO-algorithm in a 3D\ncontext.\n  First, we present results of test simulations that demonstrate the accuracy\nof the newly implemented FARGO-method in 3D. For a planet mass of 20 M_earth we\nthen show that the inclusion of radiative effects yields a torque reversal also\nin full 3D. For the same opacity law used the effect is even stronger in 3D\nthan in the corresponding 2D simulations, due to a slightly thinner disc.\nFinally, we demonstrate the extent of the torque reversal by calculating a\nsequence of planet masses. Through full 3D simulations of embedded planets in\nviscous, radiative discs we confirm that the migration can be directed outwards\nup to planet masses of about 33 M_earth. Hence, the effect may help to resolve\nthe problem of too rapid inward migration of planets during their type-I phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2009 10:19:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Immediately after the explosion has been launched, a region\nof low density and high entropy forms behind the ejecta which is continuously\nsubject to neutrino heating.

A\nsimple criterion emerges that theoretical models can ignore the role of thermal\nvibrations only if the Debye-Waller Factor is ignored in the analysis of\ndiffraction data. Diffraction data constrain all theoretical models to\nincorporate the role of thermal vibrations. This conclusion is also supported\nby other experimental results, the effect of thermal vibrations on ordering\nenergy that is of the same order of magnitude as ordering energy and an isotope\neffect on magnetic phase transitions. An electron-phonon interaction (EPI)\nformalism that incorporates the Debye-Waller Factor in electronic structure\ncalculations already exists and must be adopted for a correct understanding of\nphase transitions as it can account for all the different experimental results\nmentioned above.

These include: the (possibly luminosity-dependent) decline of source\nspace densities at high redshifts; the possible dichotomies between\nevolutionary properties of low- versus high-luminosity and of flat- versus\nsteep-spectrum AGN-powered radio sources; and the nature of sources accounting\nfor the upturn of source counts at sub-mJy levels. It is shown that\nstraightforward extrapolations of evolutionary models, accounting for both the\nfar-IR counts and redshift distributions of star-forming galaxies, match the\nradio source counts at flux-density levels of tens of microJy remarkably well.\nWe consider the statistical properties of rare but physically very interesting\nclasses of sources, such as GHz Peak Spectrum and ADAF/ADIOS sources, and radio\nafterglows of gamma-ray bursts. We also discuss the exploitation of large-area\nradio surveys to investigate large scale structure through studies of\nclustering and the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. Finally we briefly describe\nthe potential of the new and forthcoming generations of radio telescopes. A\ncompendium of source counts at different frequencies is given in an appendix.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2009 13:28:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2009 19:41:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

However, the physical manifestation of the instability\nin terms of characteristic length and time scales can be described by a\nlinearized form of the initial conditions of the films's dynamics. Alternately,\nthe thermodynamic approach based on equating the rate of free energy decrease\nto the viscous dissipation [de Gennes, C. R. Acad. Paris.v298, 1984] can give\nsimilar information. Here we have evaluated dewetting in the presence of\nthermocapillary forces arising from a film-thickness (h) dependent temperature.\nSuch a situation can be found during pulsed laser melting of ultrathin metal\nfilms where nanoscale effects lead to a local h-dependent temperature. The\nthermodynamic approach provides an analytical description of this\nthermocapillary dewetting. The results of this approach agree with those from\nlinear theory and experimental observations provided the minimum value of\nviscous dissipation is equated to the rate of free energy decrease. The flow\nboundary condition that produces this minimum viscous dissipation is when the\nfilm-substrate tangential stress is zero. The physical implication of this\nfinding is that the spontaneous dewetting instability follows the path of\nminimum rate of energy loss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2009 13:42:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 30 Jan 2010 05:01:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The model\ncontains 14 free parameters and is fitted to the 2008 March 25 CME event\nobserved with STEREO/A and B. Our model is able to reproduce the observed CME\nexpansion and related EUV dimming during the initial phase from 18:30 UT to\n19:00 UT. The CME kinematics can be characterized by a constant acceleration\n(i.e., a constant magnetic driving force). While the observations of EUVI/A are\nconsistent with a spherical bubble geometry, we detect significant asymmetries\nand density inhomogeneities with EUVI/B. This new forward-modeling method\ndemonstrates how the observed EUV dimming can be used to model physical\nparameters of the CME source region, the CME geometry, and CME kinematics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2009 14:53:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The presence of\ndirectional interactions leads to the formation of a persistent interconnected\nnetwork at temperatures where phase separation does not occur. We find that\nlarge scale spatial correlations strongly depend on the volume fraction and\ncharacterize the formation of the persistent network. We observe a pre-peak in\nthe static structure factor and relate it to the network structure. The slow\ndynamics at gelation is characterized by the coexistence of fast collective\nmotion of the mobile parts of the network structure (chains) with large scale\nrearrangements producing stretched exponential relaxations. We show that, once\nthe network is sufficiently persistent, it induces slow, cooperative processes\nrelated to the network nodes.

For large\npath-loss exponent, this provides an information-theoretic scaling\ncharacterization of the entire caching capacity region. The proposed\ncommunication scheme achieving the inner bound shows that the problems of cache\nselection and channel coding can be solved separately without loss of\norder-optimality.
