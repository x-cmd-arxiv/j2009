This study aims to experimentally quantify the broad-band\nUV-induced production rates of complex organics in CH3OH-rich ices at 20-70 K\nunder ultra-high vacuum conditions. The reaction products are mainly identified\nby RAIRS and TPD experiments. Complex organics are readily formed in all\nexperiments, both during irradiation and during a slow warm-up of the ices to\n200 K after the UV lamp is turned off. The relative abundances of photoproducts\ndepend on the UV fluence, the ice temperature, and whether pure CH3OH ice or\nCH3OH:CH4/CO ice mixtures are used. C2H6, CH3CHO, CH3CH2OH, CH3OCH3, HCOOCH3,\nHOCH2CHO and (CH2OH)2 are all detected in at least one experiment. The derived\nproduct-formation yields and their dependences on different experimental\nparameters, such as the initial ice composition, are used to estimate the CH3OH\nphotodissociation branching ratios in ice and the relative diffusion barriers\nof the formed radicals. The experiments show that ice photochemistry in CH3OH\nices is efficient enough to explain the observed abundances of complex organics\naround protostars and that ratios of complex molecules can be used to constrain\ntheir formation pathway.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Aug 2009 23:21:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

We used\nthe IRAM 30m radiotelescope to map the N=1-0 and N=2-1 transitions of CCH\ntowards the prestellar cores L1498 and CB246. Towards CB246, we also mapped the\n1.3 mm dust emission, the J=1-0 transition of N2H+ and the J=2-1 transition of\nC18O. We used a Monte Carlo radiative transfer program to analyse the CCH\nobservations of L1498.

Moreover, the comparison of our\nMonte-Carlo calculations with observations suggest that the non-LTE deviations\ncan be qualitatively understood.

Presently, there is significant disagreement regarding the\neffect of disorder on transport in the disordered Bose-Hubbard (DBH) model,\nwhich is the paradigm used to theoretically study disorder in strongly\ncorrelated bosonic systems. We experimentally realize the DBH model by using\noptical speckle to introduce precisely known, controllable, and fine-grained\ndisorder to an optical lattice5.

Emergence\nof the IN at disorder strengths several hundred times the tunnelling energy\nagrees with a predicted SF--Bose glass (BG) transition from recent quantum\nMonte Carlo (QMC) work.

We find that increasing disorder strength generically leads\nto greater dissipation in the regime of mixed SF and Mott-insulator (MI)\nphases, excluding predictions of a disorder-induced, or \"re-entrant,\" SF (RSF).\nWhile the absence of an RSF may be explained by the effect of finite\ntemperature, we strongly constrain theories by measuring bounds on the entropy\nper particle in the disordered lattice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Aug 2009 18:57:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 27 Dec 2009 05:29:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Several effects complicate the interpretation of results from\ndetectors based upon these materials. First, fast neutrons will often leave a\ndetector before depositing all of their energy within it. Second, fast neutrons\nwill typically scatter several times within a detector, and there is a\nnon-proportional relationship between the energy of, and the scintillation\nlight produced by, each individual scatter; therefore, there is not a\ndeterministic relationship between the scintillation light observed and the\nneutron energy deposited. Here we demonstrate a hardware technique for reducing\nboth of these effects.

These arguments, though preliminary,\nare confirmed by recent investigations of the seismic moment distribution in\nglobal earthquake catalogs and by the results on the distribution in crystals\nof dislocation avalanche sizes. We consider possible systematic and random\nerrors in determining earthquake size, especially its seismic moment. These\neffects increase the estimate of the parameter beta of the power-law\ndistribution of earthquake sizes. In particular, we find that estimated\nbeta-values may be inflated by 1-3% because relative moment uncertainties\ndecrease with increasing earthquake size. Moreover, earthquake clustering\ngreatly influences the beta-parameter. If clusters (aftershock sequences) are\ntaken as the entity to be studied, then the exponent value for their size\ndistribution would decrease by 5-10%. The complexity of any earthquake source\nalso inflates the estimated beta-value by at least 3-7%. The centroid depth\ndistribution also should influence the beta-value, an approximate calculation\nsuggests that the exponent value may be increased by 2-6%. Taking all these\neffects into account, we propose that the recently obtained beta-value of 0.63\ncould be reduced to about 0.52--0.56: near the universal constant value (1/2)\npredicted by theoretical arguments. We also consider possible consequences of\nthe universal beta-value and its relevance for theoretical and practical\nunderstanding of earthquake occurrence in various tectonic and Earth structure\nenvironments. Using comparative crystal deformation results may help us\nunderstand the generation of seismic tremors and slow earthquakes and\nilluminate the transition from brittle fracture to plastic flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Aug 2009 01:48:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2010 00:00:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

At the end of the analysis of\navailable approaches for the quality of service of the IEEE 802.11 standard,\nthe objective of this paper is to suggest a new method named DF-DCF\nDifferentiated Frame DCF. The performance of the suggested method in a Network\nSimulator (NS) environment allowed its validation through a set of testing and\nsimulation scenarios. Simulation results have shown that the DF-DCF method is\nbetter suited for mobile nodes in a wireless communication network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Aug 2009 10:22:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-11"}

This extension is\nsimilar to the size and flattening measured with the VLTI/AMBER instrument in\nthe K band at 2 microns. The size of the circumstellar envelopes for these\nclassical Be stars does not seem to vary strongly on the observed wavelength\nbetween 8 and 12microns. Moreover, the size and shape of Alpha Ara's disk is\nalmost identical at 2, 8, and 12microns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Aug 2009 15:15:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

As is well-known, this has a cohomological interpretation,\nproducing a continuous ell-adic Galois representation. This paper studies the\nL-function attached to the k-th symmetric power of this representation using\nboth ell-adic and p-adic methods. Using ell-adic techniques, we give an\nexplicit formula for the degree of this L-function and determine the complex\nabsolute values of its roots. Using p-adic techniques, we study the p-adic\nabsolute values of the roots.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Aug 2009 15:18:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Aug 2010 20:44:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-04"}
