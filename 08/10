These novel\nmaterials are distinguished from ordinary insulators by the presence of gapless\nmetallic boundary states, akin to the chiral edge modes in quantum Hall\nsystems, but with unconventional spin textures. Recently, experiments and\ntheoretical efforts have provided strong evidence for both two- and\nthree-dimensional topological insulators and their novel edge and surface\nstates in semiconductor quantum well structures and several Bi-based compounds.\nA key characteristic of these spin-textured boundary states is their\ninsensitivity to spin-independent scattering, which protects them from\nbackscattering and localization. These chiral states are potentially useful for\nspin-based electronics, in which long spin coherence is critical, and also for\nquantum computing applications, where topological protection can enable\nfault-tolerant information processing. Here we use a scanning tunneling\nmicroscope (STM) to visualize the gapless surface states of the\nthree-dimensional topological insulator BiSb and to examine their scattering\nbehavior from disorder caused by random alloying in this compound. Combining\nSTM and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we show that despite strong\natomic scale disorder, backscattering between states of opposite momentum and\nopposite spin is absent. Our observation of spin-selective scattering\ndemonstrates that the chiral nature of these states protects the spin of the\ncarriers; they therefore have the potential to be used for coherent spin\ntransport in spintronic devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Aug 2009 17:59:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-14"}

The channel is estimated at the receiver with a pilot signal, and\nthe estimate is fed back to the transmitter. The estimate is used for coherent\ndemodulation, and to adapt the data and pilot powers. We explicitly determine\nthe optimal pilot and data power control policies in a continuous-time limit\nwhere the channel state evolves as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck diffusion process, and\nis estimated by a Kalman filter at the receiver. The optimal pilot policy\nswitches between zero and the maximum (peak-constrained) value (``bang-bang''\ncontrol), and approximates the optimal discrete-time policy at low\nSignal-to-Noise Ratios (equivalently, large bandwidths). The switching boundary\nis defined in terms of the system state (estimated channel mean and associated\nerror variance), and can be explicitly computed. Under the optimal policy, the\ntransmitter conserves power by decreasing the training power when the channel\nis faded, thereby increasing the data rate.

The few well-known throughput optimal\npolicies in the literature are constructed using simple quadratic or\nexponential Lyapunov functions of the queue backlogs and as such they seek to\nbalance the queue backlogs across network independent of the topology. By\nconsidering a class of continuous, differentiable, and piece-wise quadratic\nLyapunov functions, this paper provides a large class of throughput optimal\nrouting policies. The proposed class of Lyapunov functions allow for the\nrouting policy to control the traffic along short paths for a large portion of\nstate-space while ensuring a negative expected drift.

Such outflows on galactic\nscales have their origin in huge star forming regions and expel metal enriched\nmaterial out of the galaxies into their surroundings as observed, for example,\nin the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 253. As massive stars in OB-associations\nexplode sequentially, shock waves are driven into the interstellar medium (ISM)\nof a galaxy and merge, forming a superbubble (SB). These SBs expand in a\ndirection perpendicular to the disk plane following the density gradient of the\nISM. We use the 2D analytical approximation by Kompaneets (1960) to model the\nexpansion of SBs in an exponentially stratified ISM. This is modified in order\nto describe the sequence of SN-explosions as a time-dependent process taking\ninto account the main-sequence life-time of the SN-progenitors and using an\ninitial mass function to get the number of massive stars per mass interval. The\nevolution of the bubble in space and time is calculated analytically, from\nwhich the onset of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities in the shell can be\ndetermined.

Since most gamma-ray\nbursts (GRBs) have Epeak above the energy range (15-150 keV) of the Burst Alert\nTelescope (BAT) on Swift, determining accurate Epeak values for large numbers\nof Swift bursts has been difficult. However, by combining data from Swift/BAT\nand the Suzaku Wide-band All-Sky Monitor (WAM), which covers the energy range\nfrom 50-5000 keV, for bursts which are simultaneously detected, one can\naccurately fit Epeak and Eiso and test the relationship between them for the\nSwift sample. Between the launch of Suzaku in July 2005 and the end of April\n2009, there were 48 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) which triggered both Swift/BAT and\nWAM and an additional 48 bursts which triggered Swift and were detected by WAM,\nbut did not trigger. A BAT-WAM team has cross-calibrated the two instruments\nusing GRBs, and we are now able to perform joint fits on these bursts to\ndetermine their spectral parameters. For those bursts with spectroscopic\nredshifts, we can also calculate the isotropic energy. Here we present the\nresults of joint Swift/BAT-Suzaku/WAM spectral fits for 91 of the bursts\ndetected by the two instruments. We show that the distribution of spectral fit\nparameters is consistent with distributions from earlier missions and confirm\nthat Swift bursts are consistent with earlier reported relationships between\nEpeak and isotropic energy. We show through time-resolved spectroscopy that\nindividual burst pulses are also consistent with this relationship.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Aug 2009 14:57:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}
