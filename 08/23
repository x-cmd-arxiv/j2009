The gas particles are\nadsorbed and the clusters become hosts. If the clusters are size selected, the\nnumber of guests will be Poisson distributed.

The\neffects of a statistical distribution of the cluster sizes in a beam of\nclusters are discussed. We derive the average collision rates. Additionally, we\npresent Poisson mixture models that involve also standard deviations. We derive\nthe collision statistics for common size distributions of hosts and also for\nsome generalizations thereof. The models can be applied to large noble gas\nclusters traversing doping gas.

The latter is related to an effective variable mass (Euler mass) of\nthe particle produced by a fluid motion. The most stronger attraction potential\n(up to the value of temperature T) corresponds to a situation of uncharged\nparticles and a relatively large Debye screening length. In this case the third\nmechanism of attraction enters the game.

A prediction was presented for gamma-ray\nemission from a cluster of galaxies at a detectable level with the current\ngeneration of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes. The gamma-ray emission\nwas produced via inverse Compton upscattering of cosmic microwave background\n(CMB) photons by electron-positron pairs generated by collisions of UHE cosmic\nrays in the cluster. We observed two clusters of galaxies, Abell 3667 and Abell\n4038, searching for very-high-energy gamma-ray emission with the CANGAROO-III\natmospheric Cherenkov telescope system in 2006. The analysis showed no\nsignificant excess around these clusters, yielding upper limits on the\ngamma-ray emission. From a comparison of the upper limit for the north-west\nradio relic region of Abell 3667 with a model prediction, we derive a lower\nlimit for the magnetic field of the region of ~0.1 micro G. This shows the\npotential of gamma-ray observations in studies of the cluster environment. We\nalso discuss the flux upper limit from cluster center regions using a model of\ngamma-ray emission from neutral pions produced in hadronic collisions of\ncosmic-ray protons with the intra-cluster medium (ICM). The derived upper limit\nof the cosmic-ray energy density within this framework is an order of magnitude\nhigher than that of our Galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Aug 2009 13:52:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

They\ninclude the class of non-linear electrodynamics supporting ESS non-topological\nsoliton solutions in absence of gravity. We establish that the qualitative\nstructure of the G-ESS solutions of admissible models is fully characterized by\nthe asymptotic and central-field behaviours of their ESS solutions in flat\nspace (or, equivalently, by the behaviour of the lagrangian densities in vacuum\nand on the point of the boundary of their domain of definition, where the\nsecond gauge invariant vanishes). The structure of these G-ESS configurations\nfor admissible models supporting divergent-energy ESS solutions in flat space\nis qualitatively the same as in the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om case.
