This phase can be understood, either as emerging from the\nmeasurements, or preexisting to them; in the latter case, the originating\nstates could be phase states with unknown phases, so that an average over all\ntheir possible values is taken. Both points of view lead to a description of\nprobabilities of results of experiments in terms of a phase angle, which plays\nthe role of a classical variable. Nevertheless, in some situations, this\ndescription is not sufficient: another variable, which we call the \"quantum\nangle\", emerges from the theory. This article studies various manifestations of\nthe quantum angle. We first introduce the quantum angle by expressing two Fock\nstates crossing a beam splitter in terms of phase states, and relate the\nquantum angle to off-diagonal matrix elements in the phase representation. Then\nwe consider an experiment with two beam splitters, where two experimenters make\ndichotomic measurements with two interferometers and detectors that are far\napart; the results lead to violations of the Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt\ninequality (valid for local-realistic theories, including classical\ndescriptions of the phase). Finally, we discuss an experiment where particles\nfrom each of two sources are either deviated via a beam splitter to a side\ncollector or proceed to the point of interference. For a given interference\nresult, we find \"population oscillations\" in the distributions of the deviated\nparticles, which are entirely controlled by the quantum angle. Various versions\nof population oscillation experiments are discussed, with two or three\nindependent condensates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Aug 2009 18:53:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 22 Aug 2009 16:20:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 20 Apr 2010 18:54:25 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 26 May 2010 18:59:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

For the case of symmetric\nMIMO-MAC flat fading channels, their DMT result reduces to exactly the same as\nthat derived by Tse et al., and we therefore focus on their criteria for\nconstructing MAC-DMT optimal codes, especially when the number of receive\nantennas is sufficiently large. In such case, we show their criterion is\nequivalent to requiring the codes of any subset of users to satisfy a joint\nnon-vanishing determinant criterion when the system operates in the antenna\npooling regime. Finally an upper bound on the product of minimum eigenvalues of\nthe difference matrices is provided, and is used to show any MIMO-MAC codes\nsatisfying their criterion can possibly exist only when the target multiplexing\ngain is small.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Aug 2009 16:49:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-24"}

From a physical perspective, the entropy of the RT\ndistribution provides a model-free estimate of the amount of processing\nperformed by the cognitive system. In this way, the focus is shifted from the\nconventional interpretation of individual RTs being either long or short, into\ntheir distribution being more or less complex in terms of entropy. The new\napproach enables the estimation of the cognitive processing load without\nreference to the informational content of the stimuli themselves, thus\nproviding a more appropriate estimate of the cognitive impact of different\nsources of information that are carried by experimental stimuli or tasks. The\npaper introduces the formulation of the theory, followed by an empirical\nvalidation using a database of human RTs in lexical tasks (visual lexical\ndecision and word naming). The results show that this new interpretation of RTs\nis more powerful than the traditional one. The method provides theoretical\nestimates of the processing loads elicited by individual stimuli. These loads\nsharply distinguish the responses from different tasks. In addition, it\nprovides upper-bound estimates for the speed at which the system processes\ninformation. Finally, I argue that the theoretical proposal, and the associated\nempirical evidence, provide strong arguments for an adaptive system that\nsystematically adjusts its operational processing speed to the particular\ndemands of each stimulus. This finding is in contradiction with Hick's law,\nwhich posits a relatively constant processing speed within an experimental\ncontext.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Aug 2009 17:00:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-24"}

The study problem is, in the sense of graph theory, to find a\nshortest path tree spanning a weighted graph. This is a well-studied problem\nwhere for example Dijkstra's algorithm provides a solution for non-negative\nedge weights. The present contribution shows by simulation examples that simple\nmodifications of known distributed approaches here can provide significant\nimprovements in performance. Phase transition phenomena, which are known to\ntake place in networks close to percolation thresholds, may explain these\nobservations. An initial method, which here serves as reference, assumes the\nsink node starts organisation of the network (tree) by transmitting a control\nmessage advertising its availability for its neighbours. These neighbours then\nadvertise their current cost estimate for routing a message to the sink. A node\nwhich in this way receives a message implying an improved route to the sink,\nadvertises its new finding and remembers which neighbouring node the message\ncame from. This activity proceeds until there are no more improvements to\nadvertise to neighbours. The result is a tree network for cost effective\ntransmission of messages to the sink (root). This distributed approach has\npotential for simple improvements which are of interest when minimisation of\nstorage and communication of network information are a concern. Fast\norganisation of the network takes place when the number $k$ of connections for\neach node ({\\em degree}) is close above its critical value for global network\npercolation and at the same time there is a threshold for the nodes to decide\nto advertise network route updates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Aug 2009 05:34:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2009 09:23:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 19 May 2010 12:55:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-20"}

The first one\ndeals with spectral smoothness, in the regularization framework, while the\nsecond one is devoted to time continuity, in the Kalman formalism. The present\npaper proposes an original synthesis of the two contributions: a new\nregularized criterion is introduced that takes both information into account.\nThe criterion is efficiently optimized by a Kalman smoother. One of the major\nfeatures of the method is that it is entirely unsupervised: the problem of\nautomatically adjusting the hyperparameters that balance data-based versus\nprior-based information is solved by maximum likelihood. The improvement is\nquantified in the field of meteorological radar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Aug 2009 15:45:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Motivated by their experiment, we create a\nsmall turbulent state in an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate, which enables us\nto compute directly the velocity field, and we find similar non-classical\npower-law tails.
