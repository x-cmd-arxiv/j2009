We implemented the simulation\nresults as a new extension to the KY software package for X-ray spectra fitting\nof relativistic accretion disc models. Although the parameter space is rather\ncomplex, leading to a rich variety of possible outcomes, we find that on\naverage the isotropic directionality reproduces our model data to the best\nprecision. Our results also suggest that an improper usage of limb darkening\ncan partly mimic a steeper profile of radial emissivity. We demonstrate these\nresults on the case of XMM-Newton observation of the Seyfert galaxy\nMCG-6-30-15, for which we construct confidence levels of chi squared\nstatistics, and on the simulated data for the future X-ray IXO mission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2009 16:25:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2009 22:46:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 4 Sep 2009 10:48:48 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2010 15:14:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-30"}

For a\ngiven tidal field, the models are characterized by two physical scales (such as\ntotal mass and central velocity dispersion) and two dimensionless parameters\n(the concentration parameter and the tidal strength). The most significant\ndeparture from spherical symmetry occurs when the truncation radius of the\ncorresponding spherical King model is of the order of the tidal radius, which,\nfor a given tidal strength, is set by the maximum concentration value admitted.\nFor such maximally extended (or \"critical\") models the outer boundary has a\ngenerally triaxial shape, given by the zero-velocity surface of the relevant\nJacobi integral, which is basically independent of the concentration parameter.\nIn turn, the external tidal field can give rise to significant global\ndepartures from spherical symmetry (as measured, for example, by the quadrupole\nof the mass distribution of the stellar system) only for low-concentration\nmodels, for which the allowed maximal value of the tidal strength can be\nrelatively high. In this paper we describe in detail the intrinsic and the\nprojected structure and kinematics of the models, covering the entire parameter\nspace, from the case of sub-critical (characterized by \"underfilling\" of the\nrelevant Roche volume) to that of critical models. The intrinsic properties can\nbe a useful starting point for numerical simulations and other investigations\nthat require initialization of a stellar system in dynamical equilibrium. The\nprojected properties are a key step in the direction of a comparison with\nobserved globular clusters and other candidate stellar systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2009 16:26:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Broadband (4-200 keV)\nspectra, fitted with an exponentially cutoff powerlaw, show that the hard\nspectral component steepens during the transition from the hard to the soft\nstate.

A statistical study of 44 CHs based on Solar and\nHeliospheric Observatory (SOHO)/MDI full disk magnetograms and SOHO/EIT 284\\AA\nimages showed that the density of the net magnetic flux, $B_{{\\rm net}}$, does\nnot correlate with the associated solar wind speeds, $V_x$.

A\npossible explanation for the low correlation between $B_{{\\rm net}}$ and $V_x$\nis proposed. The observed non-correlation might be rooted in the structural\ncomplexity of the magnetic field. As a measure of complexity of the magnetic\nfield, the filling factor, $ f(r)$, was calculated as a function of spatial\nscales. In CHs, $f(r)$ was found to be nearly constant at scales above 2 Mm,\nwhich indicates a monofractal structural organization and smooth temporal\nevolution. The magnitude of the filling factor is 0.04 from the Hinode SOT/SP\ndata and 0.07 from the MDI/HR data. The Hinode data show that at scales smaller\nthan 2 Mm, the filling factor decreases rapidly, which means a mutlifractal\nstructure and highly intermittent, burst-like energy release regime. The\nabsence of necessary complexity in CH magnetic fields at scales above 2 Mm\nseems to be the most plausible reason why the net magnetic flux density does\nnot seem to be related to the solar wind speed: the energy release dynamics,\nneeded for solar wind acceleration, appears to occur at small scales below 1\nMm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2009 22:53:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The diffuse H_alpha emission of M 51 is\nanalyzed using thin slab models and exponential disk models in the context of\nthe ``on-the-spot'' approximation. The scale height of the ionized gas needed\nto explain the diffuse H_alpha emission with the scenario is found to be of the\norder of ~ 1-2 kpc, consistent with those of our Galaxy and edge-on galaxies.\nThe model also provides a vertical profile, when the galaxy is viewed edge-on,\nconsisting of two-exponential components.

In\nthe scalar case, R. Lande pointed out that results are ambiguous depending on\nwhether the noise is added at arithmetic or logarithmic scale, while the matrix\ncase has been investigated by S. Tuljapurkar. Our contribution consists first\nin introducing another notion of variability than the widely used variance or\ncoefficient of variation, namely the so-called convex orders. Second, in\npopulation dynamics matrix models, we focus on how matrix components depend\nfunctionaly on uncertain environmental factors. In the log-convex case, we show\nthat, in a sense, environmental variability increases both mean population size\nand mean log-population size and makes them more variable.

At flux densities between 4\nand 16 kHz/cm2, almost no influence on the position resolution was found, it\ndegrades by only 10 mum at a detection efficiency of only 4*10-4. - We\ninvestigated inert gas mixtures on fastness and linearity of their\nposition-drifttime (r-t) relation. At a reduction of the maximum drift time by\na factor of 2, the use of the present hardware and electronics might be\npossible. For our experimental studies we used our Munich cosmic ray facility.\nTwo gas mixtures show almost identical position resolution as the standard gas.\n- For spectrometer regions of highest background rates we contributed to the\ninvestigation of newly developed 15 mm drift tubes. Position resolutions have\nbeen measured as a function of gamma background rates between 0 and 1400\nHz/cm2. - Garfield simulations have been performed to simulate space charge\neffects due to gamma irradiation. Results will be presented for the standard\ngeometry as well as for the new 15 mm drift tubes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Aug 2009 07:30:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-28"}

One core component behind dynamic\nspectrum access is the sensing of primary user activity in the shared spectrum.\nConventional distributed sensing and centralized decision framework involving\nmultiple sensor nodes is proposed to enhance the sensing performance. However,\nit is difficult to apply the conventional schemes in reality since the overhead\nin sensing measurement and sensing reporting as well as in sensing report\ncombining limit the number of sensor nodes that can participate in distributive\nsensing. In this paper, we shall propose a novel, low overhead and low\ncomplexity energy detection based cooperative sensing framework for the\ncognitive radio systems which addresses the above two issues. The energy\ndetection based cooperative sensing scheme greatly reduces the quiet period\noverhead (for sensing measurement) as well as sensing reporting overhead of the\nsecondary systems and the power scheduling algorithm dynamically allocate the\ntransmission power of the cooperative sensor nodes based on the channel\nstatistics of the links to the BS as well as the quality of the sensing\nmeasurement. In order to obtain design insights, we also derive the asymptotic\nsensing performance of the proposed cooperative sensing framework based on the\nmobility model. We show that the false alarm and mis-detection performance of\nthe proposed cooperative sensing framework improve as we increase the number of\ncooperative sensor nodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Aug 2009 09:36:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

Today, with the discovery of dark energy and the strong evidence\nin favor of an inflationary start of the Big Bang, the existence of negative\npressure is widely accepted. In fundamental physics, phase transitions are\ngenerally thought to be reversible (Cf. Ellis, New Astronomy Reviews Volume 46,\nIssue 11, October 2002, P. 645). It seems likely then that if inflation has\noccurred, the process should be reversible. I.e. when the increasing density in\na collapsing universe or star reaches a certain limit it should go through a\nphase transition to a medium with an equation of state of the type $p=\\omega\n\\rho$, where $-1< \\omega <-1/3$. If this phase transition is fundamental, i.e.\noccurs for all energy densities, a collapse will always reach a minimum radius\nand bounce. If the phase transition is symmetric, the result will lead to\noscillating universes. If however the phase transition is associated with an\nhysteresis effect, a collapsing star may, succeeding the bounce inflate into a\nnew universe with a subsequent phase transition becomes dominated by ordinary\nrelativistic matter. The aim of this note is study the time development of a\nmodel which mimics this process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Aug 2009 09:59:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2009 09:20:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-14"}

The intermolecular\ndistance in a stack (about 3.3 A) is comparable with the electron--hole\ndistance in the excited molecule. The mixing between Frenkel excitons (FEs) and\ncharge-transfer excitons (CTEs) is very essential for the excitonic and\nvibronic spectra of both crystals. In this paper, we make simulations of the\nlinear absorption spectra of the abovementioned crystals. The basic Hamiltonian\ndescribes the FE--CTEs mixing in the molecular stack (point group $C_i$) caused\nby two transfer mechanisms, notably of the electron and the hole on the\nneighbor molecules. The vibronic spectra consist of mixed excitons and one\nvibrational mode of an intramolecular vibration linearly coupled with FE and\nCTEs. Using the vibronic approach, we calculate the linear optical\nsusceptibility in the excitonic and one-phonon vibronic regions of the\nmolecular stack, as well as of a crystal which contains two types of\nnonequivalent stacks. We put the excitonic and vibrational parameters for the\ncrystals of PTCDA and MePTCDI fitted in the previous studies. We analyze the\ngeneral structure and some important features of the lineshape of the linear\nabsorption spectra in the spectral region of 15 000--23000 cm^{-1}. We vary the\nvalues of the excitonic linewidth and the parameters of the linear\nexciton--phonon coupling and look for the values which reproduce the absorption\nlineshape similar to the absorption spectra of the investigated crystals. Our\nstudy exhibits the necessity of introducing the FE--CTEs mixing in the\ninterpretation of the linear absorption spectra, especially of the MePTCDI\ncrystal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Aug 2009 11:07:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-25"}

A natural application for our\ndevelopment is to study the pion mass dependence of lattice QCD data on hyperon\nproperties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Aug 2009 14:50:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

In this framework, an\nextraction task over a text collection is expressed as a query that combines\ntext fragments with wild cards, and the query result is a set of facts in the\nform of unary, binary and general $n$-ary tuples. A significance of our\nquerying mechanism is that, despite being both simple and declarative, it can\nbe applied to a wide range of extraction tasks. A problem in querying natural\nlanguage text though is that a user-specified query may not retrieve enough\nexact matches. Unlike term queries which can be relaxed by removing some of the\nterms (as is done in search engines), removing terms from a wild card query\nwithout ruining its meaning is more challenging. Also, any query expansion has\nthe potential to introduce false positives. In this paper, we address the\nproblem of query expansion, and also analyze a few ranking alternatives to\nscore the results and to remove false positives. We conduct experiments and\nreport an evaluation of the effectiveness of our querying and scoring\nfunctions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Aug 2009 15:17:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-19"}
