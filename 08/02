The approach consists to apply a multiplicative bias\ncorrection to an oversmooth pilot estimator. In Burr et al. [2010], this method\nhas been tested to estimate energy spectra. For such data set, it was observed\nthat the method allows to decrease bias with negligible increase in variance.\nIn this paper, we study the asymptotic properties of the resulting estimate and\nprove that this estimate has zero asymptotic bias and the same asymptotic\nvariance as the local linear estimate. Simulations show that our asymptotic\nresults are available for modest sample sizes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Aug 2009 12:43:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2009 19:17:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2011 20:29:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-02"}

The\nassociated first-order equations admit an explicit solution supported by a\nnon-abelian SU(2) gauge potential, which has a logarithmically growing mass\nterm.

The Multifractal\nDetrended Cross-Correlation Analysis (MF-DXA) shows that there exist some\ncrossovers in the cross-correlation fluctuation function versus time scale of\nthe river flow and sunspot series. One of these crossovers corresponds to the\nwell-known cycle of solar activity demonstrating a universal property of the\nmentioned rivers. The scaling exponent given by DCCA for original series at\nintermediate time scale, $(12-24)\\leq s\\leq 130$ months, is $\\lambda =\n1.17\\pm0.04$ which is almost similar for all underlying rivers at\n$1\\sigma$confidence interval showing the second universal behavior of river\nrunoffs. To remove the sinusoidal trends embedded in data sets, we apply the\nSingular Value Decomposition (SVD) method. Our results show that there exists a\nlong-range cross-correlation between the sunspot numbers and the underlying\nstreamflow records. The magnitude of the scaling exponent and the corresponding\ncross-correlation exponent are $\\lambda\\in (0.76, 0.85)$ and\n$\\gamma_{\\times}\\in(0.30, 0.48)$, respectively. Different values for scaling\nand cross-correlation exponents may be related to local and external factors\nsuch as topography, drainage network morphology, human activity and so on.\nMultifractal cross-correlation analysis demonstrates that all underlying\nfluctuations have almost weak multifractal nature which is also a universal\nproperty for data series.
