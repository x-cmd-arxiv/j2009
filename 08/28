Young massive star\nclusters formed in interacting galaxies and mergers may become young globular\nclusters. The ages of these clusters can provide clues about the timing of\ninteraction-triggered events, and thus provide an important way to reconstruct\nthe star formation history of merging galaxies. Numerical simulations of galaxy\nmergers can implement different star formation rules. For instance, star\nformation dependent on gas density or triggered by shocks, predicts\nsignificantly different star formation histories. To test the validity of these\nmodels, multi-object spectroscopy was used to map the ages of young star\nclusters throughout the bodies and tails of a series of galaxy mergers at\ndifferent stages (Arp 256, NGC 7469, NGC 4676, Arp 299, IC 883 and NGC 2623).\nWe found that the cumulative distribution of ages becomes shallower as the\nstage of merger advances. This result suggests a trend of cluster ages as a\nfunction of merger stage. In NGC 4676 we found that two clusters have ages of\nabout 170 Myr, suggesting that they likely formed during its first passage.\nTheir locations in the tidal tails are consistent with the spatial distribution\nof star formation predicted by shock-induced models. When comparing the ages\nand spatial distribution of clusters in NGC 7252 to our model, we found that\nsome clusters are likely to form during the prompt starburst at first passage,\nas predicted by simulations with shock-induced star formation. These\nsimulations show that the shock-induced mechanism is an important trigger of\nstar formation and that using the ages of clusters formed in the starbursts can\neffectively determine the star formation history of merging galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2009 17:09:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-28"}

The helical magnetic field is largely\nconfined to the jet, leaving the ambient medium nonmagnetic.

This paper proposes an interpolation\nexpression for the identification of anomalous diffusion in complex signals for\nthe cases when the dynamics of the system under study reaches a steady state\n(large time intervals). This interpolation expression uses the chaotic\ndifference moment (transient structural function) of the second order as an\naverage characteristic of displacements. A general procedure for identifying\nanomalous diffusion and calculating its parameters in real stochastic signals,\nwhich includes the removal of the regular (low-frequency) components from the\nsource signal and the fitting of the chaotic part of the experimental\ndifference moment of the second order to the interpolation expression, is\npresented. The procedure was applied to the analysis of the dynamics of\nmagnetoencephalograms, blinking fluorescence of quantum dots, and X-ray\nemission from accreting objects. For all three applications, the interpolation\nwas able to adequately describe the chaotic part of the experimental difference\nmoment, which implies that anomalous diffusion manifests itself in these\nnatural signals. The results of this study make it possible to broaden the\nrange of complex natural processes in which anomalous diffusion can be\nidentified.

We find that, in the absence of regulation by magnetic\nfields and outflow feedback, massive stars form readily in a turbulent,\nmoderately condensed clump of $\\sim 1,600$ solar masses, along with a cluster\nof hundreds of lower mass stars. The massive stars are fed at high rates by (1)\ntransient dense filaments produced by large-scale turbulent compression at\nearly times, and (2) by the clump-wide global collapse resulting from\nturbulence decay at late times. In both cases, the bulk of the massive star's\nmass is supplied from outside a 0.1 pc-sized \"core\" that surrounds the star. In\nour simulation, the massive star is clump-fed rather than core-fed. The need\nfor large-scale feeding makes the massive star formation prone to regulation by\noutflow feedback, which directly opposes the feeding processes. The outflows\nreduce the mass accretion rates onto the massive stars by breaking up the dense\nfilaments that feed the massive star formation at early times, and by\ncollectively slowing down the global collapse that fuel the massive star\nformation at late times. The latter is aided by a moderate magnetic field of\nstrength in the observed range. We conclude that the massive star formation in\nour simulated turbulent, magnetized, parsec-scale clump is outflow-regulated\nand clump-fed (ORCF for short). An important implication is that the formation\nof low-mass stars in a dense clump can affect the formation of massive stars in\nthe same clump, through their outflow feedback on the clump dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 2009 04:31:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

The majority of the systems (10\nfrom 11) show abundance patterns which relate them to outflows from low and\nintermediate mass stars. All systems have sub-kpc linear sizes along the\nline-of-sight with many less than 20 pc. In several systems, silicon is\ndeficient, presumably due to the depletion onto dust grains in the envelopes of\ndust-forming stars and the subsequent gas-dust separation. At any value of\n[C/H], nitrogen can be either deficient, [N/C]<0, or enhanced, [N/C]>0, which\nsupposes that the nitrogen enrichment occurs irregularly. In some cases, the\nlines of MgII 2796, 2803 appear to be shifted, probably as a result of an\nenhanced content of heavy isotopes 25Mg and 26Mg in the absorbing gas relative\nto the solar isotopic composition. Seven absorbers are characterized by low\nmean ionization parameter U, log U<-2.3, among them only one system has a\nredshift z>2 whereas all others are found at z ~= 1.8. Comparing the space\nnumber density of metal-rich absorbers with the comoving density of\nstar-forming galaxies at z ~= 2, we estimate that the circumgalactic volume of\neach galaxy is populated by 10^7 - 10^8 such absorbers with total mass\n<=1/100th of the stellar galactic mass. Possible effects of high metal content\non the peak values of star-forming and AGN activities at z~2 are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 2009 07:52:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

As part of the Cores to Disks Legacy Program, we obtained more than a\nhundred Spitzer/IRS spectra of TTauri stars. More than 3/4 of our objects show\nat least one crystalline silicate emission feature that can be essentially\nattributed to Mg-rich silicates. Observational properties of the crystalline\nfeatures seen at lambda > 20 mu correlate with each other, while they are\nlargely uncorrelated with the properties of the amorphous silicate 10 mu\nfeature. This supports the idea that the IRS spectra essentially probe two\nindependent disk regions: a warm zone (< 1 AU) emitting at lambda ~ 10 mu and a\nmuch colder region emitting at lambda > 20 mu (< 10 AU). We identify a\ncrystallinity paradox, as the long-wavelength crystalline silicate features are\n3.5 times more frequently detected (~55 % vs. ~15%) than the crystalline\nfeatures arising from much warmer disk regions. This suggests that the disk has\nan inhomogeneous dust composition within ~10 AU. The abundant crystalline\nsilicates found far from their presumed formation regions suggests efficient\noutward radial transport mechanisms in the disks. The analysis of the shape and\nstrength of both the amorphous 10 mu feature and the crystalline feature around\n23 mu provides evidence for the prevalence of micron-sized grains in upper\nlayers of disks. Their presence in disk atmospheres suggests efficient vertical\ndiffusion, likely accompanied by grain-grain fragmentation to balance the\nefficient growth expected. Finally, the depletion of submicron-sized grains\npoints toward removal mechanisms such as stellar winds or radiation pressure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 2009 08:33:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The aim was to obtain information on the\nlongitudinal distribution of the underlying spot-generating mechanism rather\nthan on the distribution and migration of sunspots or sunspot groups on the\nsolar surface.

This\nstudy provides a challenge for solar dynamo models, as our results are\nconsistent with the presence of a non-axisymmetric spot-generating mechanism\nexperiencing differential rotation (known as phase mixing in dynamo theory).\nThe new nonparametric method introduced here, completely independent of the\nchoice of the longitudinal distribution of sunspots, was found to be a very\npowerful tool for spatio-temporal analysis of surface features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 2009 08:36:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The field of weak\nlensing is motivated by the observations made in the last decades showing that\nthe visible matter represents only about 4-5% of the Universe, the rest being\ndark. The Universe is now thought to be mostly composed by an invisible,\npressureless matter -potentially relic from higher energy theories- called\n\"dark matter\" (20-21%) and by an even more mysterious term, described in\nEinstein equations as a vacuum energy density, called \"dark energy\" (70%). This\n\"dark\" Universe is not well described or even understood, so this point could\nbe the next breakthrough in cosmology. Weak gravitational lensing is believed\nto be the most promising tool to understand the nature of dark matter and to\nconstrain the cosmological model used to describe the Universe. Gravitational\nlensing is the process in which light from distant galaxies is bent by the\ngravity of intervening mass in the Universe as it travels towards us. This\nbending causes the image of background galaxies to appear slightly distorted\nand can be used to extract significant results for cosmology. Future weak\nlensing surveys are already planned in order to cover a large fraction of the\nsky with large accuracy. However this increased accuracy also places greater\ndemands on the methods used to extract the available information. In this\npaper, we will first describe the important steps of the weak lensing\nprocessing to reconstruct the dark matter distribution from shear estimation.\nThen we will discuss the problem of statistical estimation in order to set\nconstraints on the cosmological model.

We focus on a\nparticular case with the immobile trap positioned at the hub node having the\nlargest degree. Using a method based on generating functions, we determine\nexplicitly the mean first-passage time (MFPT) for the trapping problem, which\nis the mean of the node-to-trap first-passage time over the entire network. The\nexact expression for the MFPT is calculated through the recurrence relations\nderived from the special construction of the hierarchical networks. The\nobtained rigorous formula corroborated by extensive direct numerical\ncalculations exhibits that the MFPT grows algebraically with the network order.\nConcretely, the MFPT increases as a power-law function of the number of nodes\nwith the exponent much less than 1. We demonstrate that the hierarchical\nnetworks under consideration have more efficient structure for transport by\ndiffusion in contrast with other analytically soluble media including some\npreviously studied scale-free networks.

This is reflected in the calculated electron density\ndependencies of the conductivity and the mobility. In particular, we show that\nthe mobility of graphene ribbons varies as mu(n) n^(-lambda), with\n0<lambda<0.5. The exponent lambda depends on the length of the system with\nlambda=0.5 corresponding to short structures in the ballistic regime, whereas\nthe diffusive regime lambda=0 (when the mobility is independent on the electron\ndensity) is reached for sufficiently long structures.

Nuclear fusion of the hydrogen isotopes\ndeuterium and tritium, if successful, might make a major contribution toward\nsatisfying this need. The U.S. has an important effort aimed at achieving\npractical inertial confinement fusion, ICF, which has been under development\nfor decades at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The National\nIgnition Facility (NIF) is a giant laser to multiply-shock and thus\nquasi-isentropically compress a capsule of deuterium-tritium (DT) to high\ndensity and temperature, where the fusion rate is proportional to density\nsquared times temperature to the fourth power. The principal problem that must\nbe solved for NIF to work successfully is elimination of the Rayleigh-Tailor\n(R-T) instability that originates from the interface between the solid shell\nand the DT fuel within it. The R-T instability poisons the fusion reaction by\nreducing the temperature of the DT achieved by dynamic compression driven by\nthe NIF laser. The primary technological problem today is one of Condensed\nMatter and Materials Physics (CMMP), rather than laser technology and plasma\nphysics. The CMMP of the fuel capsule that must be done to minimize growth of\nthe R-T instability is yet to be done. Based on what is known today, it is\nunlikely that NIF will produce practical amounts of fusion energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 2009 15:20:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-31"}

Combining GALEX UV observations with deep\noptical and Spitzer IR imaging, we search for XUV disks in a sample of nearby\nlow-to-intermediate mass E/S0 galaxies to explore evidence for disk rebuilding\nafter mergers. Preliminary visual classification yields ten XUV-disk candidates\nfrom the full sample of 30, intriguingly similar to the ~30% frequency for\nlate-type galaxies. These XUV candidates occur at a wide range of masses and on\nboth the red and blue sequences in color vs. stellar mass, indicating a\npossible association with processes like gas accretion and/or galaxy\ninteractions that would affect the galaxy population broadly. We go on to apply\nthe quantitative Type 1 and Type 2 XUV-disk definitions to a nine-galaxy\nsubsample analyzed in detail. For this subsample, six of the nine are Type 1\nXUVs, i.e., galaxies with UV structure beyond the expected star formation\nthreshold. The other three come close to satisfying the Type 2 definition, but\nthat definition proves problematic to apply to this sample: the NUV-derived\nstar formation threshold radii for our E/S0s often lie inside the 80% Ks-band\nlight (K80) radii, violating an implicit assumption of the Type 2 definition,\nor lie outside but not as far as the definition requires. Nonetheless, the\nthree otherwise Type 2-like galaxies (\"modified Type 2 XUVs\") have higher star\nformation rates and bluer FUV - NUV colors than the Type 1 XUVs in the sample.\nWe propose that Type 1 XUVs may reflect early or inefficient stages of star\nformation, while modified Type 2 XUVs perhaps reflect inside-out disk regrowth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 2009 15:49:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-31"}
