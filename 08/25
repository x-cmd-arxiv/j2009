In theories\nwith new particles at the ~ GeV scale, however, these q^2-dependent\ninteractions can be large, and, in some cases dominate over the standard\ninteractions. This leads to new phenomenology in direct detection experiments.\nRecoil spectra peak at non-zero energies, and the relative strengths of\ndifferent experiments can be significantly altered. We present a simple\nparameterization for models of this type which captures much of the interesting\nphenomenology and allows a comparison between experiments.

We do this by investigating the 2D substructure within three\nhigh-resolution cosmological simulations of galaxy clusters. Our main results\nfocus on non-radiative gas dynamics, but we also consider the effects of\nradiative cooling at high redshift. For our analysis, we use a novel approach,\nbased on unsharp-masking, to identify substructures in 2D surface mass density\nand X-ray surface brightness maps. At full resolution (~ 15 h^-1 kpc), this\ntechnique is capable of identifying almost all self-bound dark matter subhaloes\nwith M>10^12 h^-1 M_sun. We also report a correlation between the mass of a\nsubhalo and the area of its corresponding 2D detection; such a correlation,\nonce calibrated, could provide a useful estimator for substructure mass.\nComparing our 2D mass and X-ray substructures, we find a surprising number of\ncases where the matching fails: around one third of galaxy-sized substructures\nhave no X-ray counterpart. Some interesting cases are also found at larger\nmasses, in particular the cores of merging clusters where the situation can be\ncomplex. Finally, we degrade our mass maps to what is currently achievable with\nweak-lensing observations (~100 h^-1 kpc at z=0.2). While the completeness mass\nlimit increases by around an order of magnitude, a mass-area correlation\nremains. Our paper clearly demonstrates that the next generation of lensing\nsurveys should start to reveal a wealth of information on cluster substructure.\n(Abridged)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2009 19:07:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The contrast between the theoretically\nexpected spectra from these two source distributions is seen to play a crucial\nrole in the interpretation of the recent findings. It is shown that the\npositron to electron ratio, observed by PAMELA, may be fit over the entire\nenergy range in the nested leaky-box model for cosmic ray propagation and that\nthe ratio is expected to reach an asymptotic value of $\\sim0.6$ at high\nenergies in all conventional models of cosmic ray propagation.

The\nspectrum of secondary positrons and electrons, calculated with the nested\nleaky-box model, is subtracted from the spectrum of the electronic component to\ndetermine the spectrum of primary electrons emerging from the cosmic ray\nsources. This spectrum is analyzed in terms of contributions from a set of\ndiscrete sources sprinkled across the Galactic volume.

No energy is consumed in the suspend mode.\nHowever, the process of waking up the system itself requires a certain fixed\namount of energy, and thus suspending the system is beneficial only if the idle\ntime is long enough to compensate for this additional energy expenditure. In\nthe specific problem studied in the paper, we have a set of jobs with release\ntimes and deadlines that need to be executed on a single processor. Preemptions\nare allowed. The processor requires energy L to be woken up and, when it is on,\nit uses one unit of energy per one unit of time. It has been an open problem\nwhether a schedule minimizing the overall energy consumption can be computed in\npolynomial time. We solve this problem in positive, by providing an O(n^5)-time\nalgorithm. In addition we provide an O(n^4)-time algorithm for computing the\nminimum energy schedule when all jobs have unit length.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2009 21:44:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Sep 2010 12:28:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-06"}

For any finite number of messages, a single-letter characterization of\nthe sum-rate-distortion function was established in previous works using\nstandard information-theoretic techniques. This, however, does not provide a\nsatisfactory characterization of the infinite-message limit, which is a new,\nunexplored dimension for asymptotic-analysis in distributed block source coding\ninvolving potentially an infinite number of infinitesimal-rate messages. In\nthis paper, the infinite-message sum-rate-distortion function, viewed as a\nfunctional of the joint source pmf and the distortion levels, is characterized\nas the least element of a partially ordered family of functionals having\ncertain convex-geometric properties. The new characterization does not involve\nevaluating the infinite-message limit of a finite-message sum-rate-distortion\nexpression. This characterization leads to a family of lower bounds for the\ninfinite-message sum-rate-distortion expression and a simple criterion to test\nthe optimality of any achievable infinite-message sum-rate-distortion\nexpression. For computing the amplewise Boolean AND function, the\ninfinite-message minimum sum-rates are characterized in closed analytic form.\nThese sum-rates are shown to be achievable using infinitely many\ninfinitesimal-rate messages.

But the orbital periods in visual double stars are too large\nfor any direct interaction between the companions to take place.

The omnipresence of short-period active stars, e.g. of\nBY-Dra-type binaries, in multiple systems is explained via the dynamical\nevolution of triple stars with large mutual inclinations. The dynamical\nperturbation on the inner pair pumps up the eccentricity in a cyclic manner, a\nphenomenon known as Kozai cycling. At times of close periapsis, tidal friction\nreduces the angular momentum of the binary, causing it to shrink. When the\norbital period of the inner pair drops to a few days, fast surface rotation of\nthe companions is driven by tidal forces, boosting activity by a few orders of\nmagnitude. If the period drops still further, a merger may take place leaving a\nrapidly-rotating active dwarf with only a distant companion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2009 00:56:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-26"}

If the density of a dust layer becomes sufficiently\nhigh as a result of the sedimentation of dust grains toward the midplane of a\nprotoplanetary disk, the layer becomes gravitationally unstable and\nspontaneously fragments into planetesimals. Using a shearing box method, we\nperformed local $N$-body simulations of gravitational instability of a dust\nlayer and subsequent coagulation without gas and investigated the basic\nformation process of planetesimals. In this paper, we adopted the accretion\nmodel as a collision model. A gravitationally bound pair of particles is\nreplaced by a single particle with the total mass of the pair. This accretion\nmodel enables us to perform long-term and large-scale calculations. We\nconfirmed that the formation process of planetesimals is the same as that in\nthe previous paper with the rubble pile models. The formation process is\ndivided into three stages: the formation of non-axisymmetric structures, the\ncreation of planetesimal seeds, and their collisional growth. We investigated\nthe dependence of the planetesimal mass on the simulation domain size. We found\nthat the mean mass of planetesimals formed in simulations is proportional to\n$L_y^{3/2}$, where $L_y$ is the size of the computational domain in the\ndirection of rotation. However, the mean mass of planetesimals is independent\nof $L_x$, where $L_x$ is the size of the computational domain in the radial\ndirection if $L_x$ is sufficiently large. We presented the estimation formula\nof the planetesimal mass taking into account the simulation domain size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2009 06:40:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The effects of both binarity and metallicity on the observed\namplitude, and the dichotomy between short- and long-period Cepheids can both\nbe studied. Results: Large amplitude Cepheids with companions exhibit smaller\nphotometric amplitudes on average than solitary ones, as expected, while\ns-Cepheids pulsate with an rbitrary (although small) amplitude. The ratio of\nthe observed radial velocity to blue photometric amplitudes, A_V_RAD/A_B, is\nnot as good an indicator of the ulsation mode as predicted theoretically. This\nmay be caused by an incorrect mode assignment to a number of small amplitude\nCepheids, which are not ecessarily first overtone pulsators.

They are found in high density environments\nand all their properties are consistent with a quenching of the star formation\nvia gas stripping. However, while the migration from the blue cloud is\nrelatively quick (i.e., <=1 Gyr), a longer amount of time (a few Gyr at least)\nseems required to completely suppress the star formation and reach the red\nsequence. At all masses, migrating HI-deficient galaxies are mainly disks,\nimplying that the mechanism responsible for today's migration in clusters\ncannot have played a significant role in the creation of the red sequence at\nhigh-redshift. Conversely, HI-normal transition galaxies are a more\nheterogeneous population. A fraction of these objects show evidence for\naccretion/minor-merging events suggesting that at least part of the HI\nreservoir has an external origin. The detailed evolution of such systems is\nstill unclear, but our analysis suggests that some galaxies might have migrated\nback from the red sequence after accretion events. Our study clearly shows the\nvariety of evolutionary paths leading to the transition region and suggests\nthat the transition galaxies may not be always associated with systems quickly\nmigrating from the blue to the red sequence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2009 08:46:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2009 14:15:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

In particular, it is still unclear how\nmagnetic fields influence the formation and dynamic of disks and outflows. Most\ncurrent information on magnetic fields close to high-mass protostars comes from\nH2O and OH maser observations. Recently, the first 6.7 GHz methanol maser\npolarization observations were made, and they reveal strong and ordered\nmagnetic fields. The morphology of the magnetic field during high-mass\nstar-formation needs to be investigated on small scales, which can only be done\nusing very long baseline interferometry observations. The massive star-forming\nregionW75N contains three radio sources and associated masers, while a\nlarge-scale molecular bipolar outflow is also present. Polarization\nobservations of the 6.7 GHz methanol masers at high angular resolution probe\nthe strength and structure of the magnetic field and determine its relation to\nthe outflow. Eight of the European VLBI network antennas were used to measure\nthe linear polarization and Zeeman-splitting of the 6.7 GHz methanol masers in\nthe star-forming region W75N. We detected 10 methanol maser features, 4 of\nwhich were undetected in previous work. All arise near the source VLA1 of W75N.\nThe linear polarization of the masers reveals a tightly ordered magnetic field\nover more than 2000 AU around VLA1 that is exactly aligned with the large-scale\nmolecular outflow. This is consistent with the twisted magnetic field model\nproposed for explaining dust polarization observations. The Zeeman-splitting\nmeasured on 3 of the maser features indicates a dynamically important magnetic\nfield in the maser region of the order of 50mG. We suggest VLA1 is the powering\nsources of the bipolar outflow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2009 10:19:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

This problem has been addressed under global error criteria related to\nthe symmetric set difference. However, in certain applications a spatially\nuniform mode of convergence is desirable to ensure that the estimated set is\nclose to the target set everywhere. The Hausdorff error criterion provides this\ndegree of uniformity and, hence, is more appropriate in such situations. It is\nknown that the minimax optimal rate of error convergence for the Hausdorff\nmetric is $(n/\\log n)^{-1/(d+2\\alpha)}$ for level sets with boundaries that\nhave a Lipschitz functional form, where the parameter $\\alpha$ characterizes\nthe regularity of the density around the level of interest.

Furthermore, previously\ndeveloped estimators achieve the minimax optimal rate for rather restricted\nclasses of sets (e.g., the boundary fragment and star-shaped sets) that\neffectively reduce the set estimation problem to a function estimation problem.\nThis characterization precludes level sets with multiple connected components,\nwhich are fundamental to many applications.

Baade. Despite its importance, very few high resolution abundance\nanalyses of stars in this cluster are available in the literature. The bulge\nmetal-poor clusters may be important tracers of the early chemical enrichment\nof the Galaxy. The main purpose of this study is the determination of\nmetallicity and elemental ratios in individual stars of NGC 6522. High\nresolution spectra of 8 giants of the bulge globular cluster NGC 6522 were\nobtained at the 8m VLT UT2-Kueyen telescope with the FLAMES+GIRAFFE\nspectrograph. Multiband V,I,J,Ks} photometry was used to derive effective\ntemperatures as reference values. Spectroscopic parameters are derived from FeI\nand FeII lines, and adopted for the derivation of abundance ratios. The present\nanalysis provides a metallicity [Fe/H] = -1.0+-0.2. The alpha-elements Oxygen,\nMagnesium and Silicon show [O/Fe]=+0.4, [Mg/Fe]=[Si/Fe]= +0.25, whereas Calcium\nand Titanium show shallower ratios of [Ca/Fe]=[Ti/Fe]=+0.15. The\nneutron-capture r-process element Europium appears to be overabundant by\n[Eu/Fe]=+0.4. The neutron-capture s-elements La and Ba are enhanced by\n[La/Fe]=+0.35 and [Ba/Fe]=+0.5. The large internal errors, indicating the large\nstar-to-star variationin the Ba and Eu abundances, are also discussed. The\nmoderate metallicity combined to a blue Horizontal Branch (BHB), are\ncharacteristics similar to those of HP~1 and NGC 6558, pointing to a population\nof very old globular clusters in the Galactic bulge. Also, the abundance ratios\nin NGC 6522 resemble those in HP 1 and NGC 6558. The ultimate conclusion is\nthat the bulge is old, and went through an early prompt chemical enrichment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2009 12:17:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Although based on a very small number of observations, a\nradio/X-ray correlation seems to exist for this system, with a slope of\nalpha=0.40 +/- 0.07 (F_{radio} \\propto F_{X}^{alpha}), which is different than\nthe slope of alpha=1.40 +/- 0.25 found for another atoll source, 4U 1728-34,\nbut interestingly enough is relatively close to the values obtained for several\nblack hole X-ray binaries.

This behaviour, also reported in the neutron star X-ray binary 4U\n1728-34, may be analogous to the suppression of radio emission in black hole\nX-ray binaries in bright, soft X-ray states.
