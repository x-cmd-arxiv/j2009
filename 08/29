The physics of particle\nheating depends on whether the gyrofrequency of a particle is comparable to the\nfrequency of a turbulent fluctuation that is resolved on the computational\ndomain. Particles with these frequencies nearly equal undergo strong\nperpendicular heating (relative to the local magnetic field) and pitch angle\nscattering. By contrast, particles with large gyrofrequency undergo strong\nparallel heating. Simulations with a finite resistivity produce additional\nparallel heating due to parallel electric fields in small-scale current sheets.\nMany of our results are consistent with linear theory predictions for the\nparticle heating produced by the Alfven and slow magnetosonic waves that make\nup Alfvenic turbulence. However, in contrast to linear theory predictions,\nenergy exchange is not dominated by discrete resonances between particles and\nwaves; instead, the resonances are substantially ``broadened.'' We discuss the\nimplications of our results for solar and astrophysics problems, in particular\nthe thermodynamics of the near-Earth solar wind. We conclude that Alfvenic\nturbulence produces significant parallel heating via the interaction between\nparticles and magnetic field compressions (``slow waves''). However, on scales\nabove the proton Larmor radius, Alfvenic turbulence does not produce\nsignificant perpendicular heating of protons or minor ions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 2009 18:03:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

In this paper, we show that\nrandomly encoding the signal can protect it against channel uncertainty when\nthe channel is sparse. Before transmission, the signal is mapped into a\nslightly longer codeword using a random matrix. From the received signal, we\nare able to simultaneously estimate the channel and recover the transmitted\nsignal. We discuss two schemes for the recovery. Both of them exploit the\nsparsity of the underlying channel. We show that if the channel impulse\nresponse is sufficiently sparse, the transmitted signal can be recovered\nreliably.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 2009 19:36:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 2009 21:34:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

We conclude that `massive'\nstar formation that occurs in a high density, high metallicity environment,\nlike that encountered in circumnuclear star-forming regions, takes place in\nsystems that comply to the definition of super stellar clusters and that are\narranged in star forming complexes. These complexes have Halpha luminosities,\nand therefore masses of ionizing stars, that overlap at the lower end with\nthose found in HII galaxies, which have a much lower metallicity. The fact that\ntheir ionization structure and the temperature of their ionizing radiation\nfield are very similar, point to stellar clusters in these two environments\nwhich have the same equivalent effective temperature. This is contrary to what\nis expected from stellar evolution models which predict lower stellar effective\ntemperatures in high metallicity regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 2009 19:40:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-01"}

The IRC 4 um (N4), 7 um (S7), and 11 um\n(S11) band images and the WIRC H2 v=1->0 S(1) 2.12 um image show similar\ndiffuse features, around a shocked CO cloud. We analyzed the emission through\ncomparison with the H2 line emission of several shock models. The IRC colors\nare well explained by the thermal admixture model of H2 gas--whose\ninfinitesimal H2 column density has a power-law relation with the temperature\n$T$, $dN\\sim T^{-b}dT$--with n(H2) $\\sim3.9\\times10^4$ cm^{-2}, $b\\sim4.2$, and\nN(H2;T>100K) $\\sim2.8\\times10^{21}$ cm^{-2}. We interpreted these parameters\nwith several different pictures of the shock-cloud interactions--multiple\nplanar C-shocks, bow shocks, and shocked clumps--and discuss their weaknesses\nand strengths. The observed H2 v=1->0 S(1) intensity is four times greater than\nthe prediction from the power-law admixture model, the same tendency as found\nin the northern part of HB 21 (Paper I). We also explored the limitation of the\nthermal admixture model with respect to the derived model parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Aug 2009 02:19:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2009 03:25:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

We\ncarry out the bulge-disk decomposition using the growth curve fitting method.\nIt is found that bulge properties, effective radius, effective surface\nbrightness, and also absolute magnitude, change systematically with the\nmorphological sequence; from early to late types, the size becomes somewhat\nlarger, and surface brightness and luminosity fainter. In contrast disks are\nnearly universal, their properties remaining similar among disk galaxies\nirrespective of detailed morphologies from S0 to Sc. While these tendencies\nwere often discussed in previous studies, the present study confirms them based\non a large homogeneous magnitude-limited field galaxy sample with morphological\ntypes estimated. The systematic change of bulge-to-total luminosity ratio,\n$B/T$, along the morphological sequence is therefore not caused by disks but\nmostly by bulges. It is also shown that elliptical galaxies and bulges of\nspiral galaxies are unlikely to be in a single sequence.

We investigate the ortho-water abundance in outflows and shocks in\norder to improve our knowledge of shock chemistry and of the physics behind\nmolecular outflows. Methods. We have used the Odin space observatory to observe\nthe H2O(110-101) line. We obtain strip maps and single pointings of 13 outflows\nand two supernova remnants where we report detections for eight sources. We\nhave used RADEX to compute the beam averaged abundances of o-H2O relative to\nH2. In the case of non-detection, we derive upper limits on the abundance.\nResults. Observations of CO emission from the literature show that the volume\ndensity of H2 can vary to a large extent, a parameter that puts severe\nuncertainties on the derived abundances. Our analysis shows a wide range of\nabundances reflecting the degree to which shock chemistry is affecting the\nformation and destruction of water. We also compare our results with recent\nresults from the SWAS team. Conclusions. Elevated abundances of ortho-water are\nfound in several sources. The abundance reaches values as high as what would be\nexpected from a theoretical C-type shock where all oxygen, not in the form of\nCO, is converted to water. However, the high abundances we derive could also be\ndue to the low densities (derived from CO observations) that we assume. The\nwater emission may in reality stem from high density regions much smaller than\nthe Odin beam. We do not find any relationship between the abundance and the\nmass loss rate. On the other hand, there is a relation between the derived\nwater abundance and the observed maximum outflow velocity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Aug 2009 15:33:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2009 11:55:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}
