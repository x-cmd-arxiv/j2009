Detailed analysis yields a planet/star mass ratio\nq=(3.3+/-0.3)x10^{-4} and an angular separation between the planet and star\nwithin 10% of the angular Einstein radius. The small angular Einstein radius,\n\\theta_E=0.155+/-0.011 mas, constrains the distance to the lens to be D_L>6.0\nkpc if it is a star (M_L>0.08 M_sun).

Though dynamically important, the\nenergy released during the r-process is not yet taken into account in merger\nsimulations. We use a nuclear reaction network to calculate the heating (due to\nbeta-decays and nuclear fission) experienced by material on the\nmarginally-bound orbits nominally responsible for late-time fall-back. Since\nmatter with longer orbital periods t_orb experiences lower densities, for\nlonger periods of time, the total r-process heating rises rapidly with t_orb,\nsuch that material with t_orb > 1 seconds can become completely unbound. Thus,\nr-process heating fundamentally changes the canonical prediction of an\nuninterrupted power-law decline in the fall-back rate dM/dt at late times. When\nthe timescale for r-process to complete is > 1 second, the heating produces a\ncomplete cut-off in fall-back accretion after ~ 1 second; if robust, this would\nimply that fall-back accretion cannot explain the late-time X-ray flaring\nobserved following some short GRBs. However, for a narrow, but physically\nplausible, range of parameters, fall-back accretion can resume after ~ 10 s,\ndespite having been strongly suppressed for ~ 1-10 s after the merger.

SN 2003hv is a normal Type Ia\nsupernova (SN Ia) with photometric and spectroscopic properties consistent with\nits rarely observed B-band decline-rate parameter, Delta m_15 = 1.61 +- 0.02.\nThe blueshift of the most isolated [Fe II] lines in the nebular-phase optical\nspectrum appears consistent with those observed in the infrared at similar\nepochs.

A recurring feature of these outflows is their broad\nionization distribution including essentially ions (e.g., of Fe) from neutral\nto fully ionized. The absorption measure distribution (AMD) is defined as the\ndistribution of column density with ionization parameter |d N_H/d (log xi)|.\nAMDs of Seyfert outflows can span up to five orders of magnitude in xi. We\npresent the AMD of five outflows and show that they are all rather flat,\nperhaps slightly rising towards high ionization. More quantitatively, a\npower-law fit for log AMD ~ (log xi)^a yields slopes of 0 < a < 0.4. These\nslopes tightly constrain the density profiles of the wind, which until now\ncould be addressed only by theory. If the wind is distributed on large scales,\nthe measured slopes imply a generic density radial profile of n ~ r^{-alpha}\nwith 1 < alpha < 1.3. This scaling rules out a mass conserving radial flow of n\n~ r^{-2}, or a constant density absorber, but is consistent with a\nnon-spherical MHD outflow model in which n ~ r^{-1} along any given line of\nsight. On the other hand, if ionization variations are a result of local (delta\nr) density gradients, e.g. as in the turbulent interstellar medium (ISM), the\nAMD slopes imply density scaling of n ~ delta r^{-alpha} with 0.7 < alpha <\n1.0, which is quite different from the scaling of approximately n ~ delta\nr^{0.4} found in the Milky Way ISM and typical of incompressible turbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2009 20:10:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

When the diffusion matrix is used to\nenforce smoothness, the NPCs maximize long-run variation relative to the\noverall variation subject to orthogonality constraints. Moreover, the NPCs\nbehave as scalar autoregressions with heteroskedastic innovations; this\nsupports semiparametric identification and estimation of a multivariate\nreversible diffusion process and tests of the overidentifying restrictions\nimplied by such a process from low frequency data. We also explore implications\nfor stationary, possibly non-reversible diffusion processes. Finally, we\nsuggest a sieve method to estimate the NPCs from discretely-sampled data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2009 21:27:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-06"}

During this process, a jet and\na plasma eruption are observed. The opposite polarities of the second dipole\nseparate at first, and then cancel with each other, which is first reported in\na coronal hole. With the reduction of unsigned magnetic flux of the second\ndipole from 9.8*10^20 Mx to 3.0*10^20 Mx in two days, 171 A brightness\ndecreases by 75% and coronal loops shrink obviously.

Several days later, the northeastern\npart of the coronal hole, where the dipoles are located, appears as a quiet\nregion. These observations support the idea that the interaction between the\ntwo dipoles is caused by flux reconnection, while the cancellation between the\nopposite polarities of the second dipole is due to the submergence of original\nloops.

Two formulations\nfor non-conformally flat data, waveless (WL) and near-zone helically symmetric\n(NHS), are introduced; in each formulation, the Einstein-Euler system, written\nin 3+1 form on an asymptotically flat spacelike hypersurface, is exactly solved\nfor all metric components, including the spatially non-conformally flat\npotentials, and for irrotational flow. A numerical method applicable to both\nformulations is explained with an emphasis on the imposition of a spatial gauge\ncondition. Results are shown for solution sequences of irrotational BNS with\nmatter approximated by parametrized equations of state that use a few segments\nof polytropic equations of state. The binding energy and total angular momentum\nof solution sequences computed within the conformally flat --\nIsenberg-Wilson-Mathews (IWM) -- formulation are closer to those of the third\npost-Newtonian (3PN) two point particles up to the closest orbits, for the more\ncompact stars, whereas sequences resulting from the WL/NHS formulations deviate\nfrom the 3PN curve even more for the sequences with larger compactness.

However, network\nedges are considered to be the same in almost all these studies. In this paper,\nwe present a simple classification method, which divides the edges of\nundirected, unweighted networks into two types: p2c and p2p. The p2c edge\nrepresents a hierarchical relationship between two nodes, while the p2p edge\nrepresents an equal relationship between two nodes. It is surprising and\nunexpected that for many real-world networks from a wide variety of domains\n(including computer science, transportation, biology, engineering and social\nscience etc), the p2c degree distribution follows a power law more strictly\nthan the total degree distribution, while the p2p degree distribution follows\nthe Weibull distribution very well. Thus, the total degree distribution can be\nseen as a mixture of power-law and Weibull distributions. More surprisingly, it\nis found that in many cases, the total degree distribution can be better\ndescribed by the Weibull distribution, rather than a power law as previously\nsuggested. By comparing two topology models, we think that the origin of the\nWeibull distribution in complex networks might be a mixture of both\npreferential and random attachments when networks evolve.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Aug 2009 05:13:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Aug 2009 01:21:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2009 06:15:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-01"}

Assuming that\nsimulations ccurately predict the number of cosmic strings in the universe,\nthis non-detection allows us to place upper limits on the unitless Universal\ncosmic string tension of G mu/c^2 < 2.3 x 10^-6, and cosmic string density of\nOmega_s < 2.1 x 10^-5 at the 95% confidence level (marginalising over the other\nparameter in each case).

Working up to order $a^3$, associated to the\ncreation of two particle-hole pairs, reveals the first signature of the\ncomposite nature of the bosonic dimer. Finally, a complementary variational\nstudy provides an accurate estimate of the dimer energy even at large\nscattering length.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Aug 2009 07:55:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 15 Aug 2009 09:47:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-23"}

A simple and robust\nmethod for connectivity mapping with increased specificity and sensitivity was\nrecently developed, and its utility demonstrated using experimentally derived\ngene signatures.\n  Results: This paper introduces sscMap (statistically significant connections'\nmap), a Java application designed to undertake connectivity mapping tasks using\nthe recently published method. The software is bundled with a default\ncollection of reference gene-expression profiles based on the publicly\navailable dataset from the Broad Institute Connectivity Map 02, which includes\ndata from over 7000 Affymetrix microarrays, for over 1000 small-molecule\ncompounds, and 6100 treatment instances in 5 human cell lines. In addition, the\napplication allows users to add their custom collections of reference profiles\nand is applicable to a wide range of other 'omics technologies.\n  Conclusions: The utility of sscMap is two fold.

In the cannonball (CB) model of GRBs, this common\norigin is mass accretion episodes of fall-back matter on a newly born compact\nobject. The prompt emission pulses are produced by a bipolar jet of highly\nrelativistic plasmoids (CBs) ejected in the early, major episodes of mass\naccretion. As the accretion material is consumed, one may expect the engine's\nactivity to weaken. X-ray flares ending the prompt emission and during the\nafterglow phase are produced in such delayed episodes of mass accretion. The\ncommon engine, environment and radiation mechanisms (inverse Compton scattering\nand synchrotron radiation) produce their observed similarities. Flares in both\nlong GRBs and short hard gamma ray bursts (SHBs) can also be produced by\nbipolar ejections of CBs following a phase transition in compact objects due to\nloss of angular momentum and/or cooling. Optical flares, however, are mostly\nproduced in collisions of CBs with massive stellar winds/ejecta or with density\nbumps along their path.

At present, 15 objects still remain\nwithout identification due to the lack of optical spectroscopic data or a clear\nradio counterpart. Our results allow us to define a flux limited sample of 203\nhigh Galactic latitude microwave sources ($f_{41GHz} \\ge 1$ Jy, $|b_{\\rm II}| >\n15^\\circ$) which is virtually completely identified (99%). The microwave band\nis ideally suited for blazar statistical studies since this is the part of the\nem spectrum that is least affected by the superposition of spectral components\nof different origin. Using this data-set we derived number counts, luminosity\nfunctions and cosmological evolution of blazars and radio galaxies at microwave\nfrequencies. Our results are in good agreement with those found at radio\nfrequencies. The 5 GHz bivariate blazar luminosity functions are similar to\nthose derived from the DXRBS survey, which shows that this sample is\nrepresentative of the blazar population at 41 GHz. Microwave selected broad-\nlined quasars are about 6 times more abundant than BL Lacs, a ratio that is\nsimilar to, or larger than, that seen at radio and gamma-ray frequencies, once\nspectral selection effects are taken into account. This strongly suggests that\nthe mechanism responsible for the generation of gamma-rays is, at first order,\nthe same in all blazar types.

They also wish to seamlessly change the\nPoAs during their ongoing sessions to improve service quality and/or reduce\nmonetary cost. If appropriately handled, multihomed mobile nodes offer a\npotential solution to this issue. In this sense, the management of multihomed\nmobile nodes in heterogeneous environment is a key research topic. In this\npaper, we present an improvement of SIP mobility (pre-call plus mid-call\nmobility) to support seamless mobility of multihomed mobile nodes in\nheterogeneous wireless networks. Pre-call mobility is extended to associate\nuser identifier (i.e. SIP URI) and interface identifiers (i.e. IP addresses).\nThe multiple addresses of a mobile device are weighted by the user to create a\npriority list in the SIP server so as to guarantee resilient reachability of\nmobile nodes and to avoid unnecessary signaling through wireless links, thus\nsaving radio resources. Then, three variations of mid-call mobility, called\nhard, hybrid and soft procedures, are also proposed. Their main aim is to\nminimize, or even avoid, packet losses during interface switching at the mobile\nnode. The proposed solutions have been implemented in a wireless heterogeneous\ntestbed composed of 802.11 WLAN plus 3.5 cellular network, which are fully\ncontrolled and configurable. The testbed has been used to study the performance\nand the robustness of the three proposed mid-call mobility procedures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Aug 2009 13:55:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-06"}

But of course, it is not sharp for many Riemannian manifolds,\ne.g. flat tori $\\R^n/\\Gamma$. We say that $S^n$, but not $\\R^n/\\Gamma$, is a\nRiemannian manifold with maximal eigenfunction growth. The problem which\nmotivates this paper is to determine the $(M, g)$ with maximal eigenfunction\ngrowth. In an earlier work, two of us showed that such an $(M, g)$ must have a\npoint $x$ where the set ${\\mathcal L}_x$ of geodesic loops at $x$ has positive\nmeasure in $S^*_x M$. We strengthen this result here by showing that such a\nmanifold must have a point where the set ${\\mathcal R}_x$ of recurrent\ndirections for the geodesic flow through x satisfies $|{\\mathcal R}_x|>0$. We\nalso show that if there are no such points, $L^2$-normalized quasimodes have\nsup-norms that are $o(\\lambda^{n-1)/2})$, and, in the other extreme, we show\nthat if there is a point blow-down $x$ at which the first return map for the\nflow is the identity, then there is a sequence of quasi-modes with\n$L^\\infty$-norms that are $\\Omega(\\lambda^{(n-1)/2})$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Aug 2009 15:31:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-29"}

Even more difficult is to explain the Swift\nobservations of the shallow decay phase and X-ray flares, if they indeed\nindicate activity of the central engine for as long as 10,000 seconds. These\ndata suggest that some other, most likely magnetic mechanisms have to be\nconsidered. The magnetic models do not require the development of accretion\ndisk within the first few seconds of the stellar collapse and hence do not\nrequire very rapidly rotating stellar cores at the pre-supernova state. This\nwidens the range of potential LGRB progenitors. In this paper, we re-examine\nthe close binary scenario allowing for the possibility of late development of\naccretion disks in the collapsar model and investigate the available range of\nmass accretion rates, black hole masses, and spins. A particularly interesting\nversion of the binary progenitor involves merger of a WR star with an\nultra-compact companion, neutron star or black hole. In this case we expect the\nformation of very long-lived accretion disks, that may explain the phase of\nshallow decay and X-ray flares observed by Swift. Similarly long-lived magnetic\ncentral engines are expected in the current single star models of LGRB\nprogenitors due to their assumed exceptionally fast rotation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Aug 2009 15:51:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}
