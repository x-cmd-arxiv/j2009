The model form factor is computed\nusing an exact covariant calculation of the lowest-order triangle diagram and\nshown to be the same as that obtained using light-front techniques. The meaning\nof transverse density is explained using coordinate space variables, allowing\nus to identify a true mean-square transverse size directly related to the form\nfactor. We show that the rest-frame charge distribution is generally not\nobservable because of the failure to uphold current conservation. Neutral\nsystems of two charged constituents are shown to obey the lore that the heavier\none is generally closer to the transverse origin than the lighter one. It is\nargued that the negative central charge density of the neutron arises, in\npion-cloud models, from pions of high longitudinal momentum. The\nnon-relativistic limit is defined precisely and the ratio of the binding energy\nto that of the mass of the lightest constituent is shown to govern the\ninfluence of relativistic effects. The exact relativistic formula for the form\nfactor reduces to the familiar one of the three-dimensional Fourier transform\nof a square of a wave function for a very limited range of parameters. For\nmasses that mimic the quark-di-quark model of the nucleon we find substantial\nrelativistic corrections for any value of $Q^2$.

When the speed of light c is taken away from\nthe fine structure constant, as shown elsewhere, this constancy implies the\nconstancy of the ratio e^2/h, e the charge of the electron and h Planck\nconstant. This forces the charge of the electron e to be constant as long as\nthe action h (an angular momentum) is a true constant too. Then the constancy\nof the Rydberg expression implies that the momentum mc is also a true constant.\nThis is just the second law of Newton. The Compton wavelength, h/mc, is then a\ntrue constant and there is no expansion at the quantum mechanical level.\nGeneral relativity then predicts that the universe is not expanding.

However, the role played by helicity in the energy cascade is still\nunclear. In non-helical flows, the velocity and the vorticity tend to align\nlocally creating patches with opposite signs of helicity. Also in helical flows\nhelicity changes sign rapidly in space. Not being a positive definite quantity,\nglobal studies considering its spectral scaling in the inertial range are\ninconclusive, except for cases where one sign of helicity is dominant. We use\nthe cancellation exponent to characterize the scaling laws followed by helicity\nfluctuations in numerical simulations of helical and non-helical turbulent\nflows, with different forcing functions and spanning a range of Reynolds\nnumbers from approximately 670 to 6200. The exponent is a measure of\nsign-singularity and can be related to the fractal dimension as well as to the\nfirst order helicity scaling exponent. The results are consistent with the\ngeometry of helical structures being filamentary.

In the regime where\ndynamo action fails, we also obtain the precise rate of decay of the magnetic\nenergy. These exact results for the model are obtained by a generalization of\nthe ``slow-mode expansion'' of Bernard, Gawedzki and Kupiainen to non-Hermitian\nevolution. Much of our analysis applies also to magnetohydrodynamic turbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 2009 00:07:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Numerical results are obtained as a\nfunction of planetesimals' eccentricity, inclination, planet's radius, and\nnon-dimensional gas-drag parameters which can be expressed by several physical\nquantities such as the radius of planetesimals and the mass of the protoplanet.\nAssuming that the radial distribution of the gas density near the surface can\nbe approximated by a power-law, we performed analytic calculation for the loss\nof planetesimals' kinetic energy due to gas drag, and confirmed agreement with\nnumerical results.

At the same time, measures across the spectrum have made it clear that\ngalaxy interactions are linked to star formation, albeit with the physical\nmechanisms much less clear. Improved data sets, including HST imaging, deep IR\ndata, and large samples with well-defined selection criteria, have started to\nreveal correlations with dynamical parameters pointing to detailed histories of\nstarbirth during collisions. The merger hypothesis for elliptical galaxies has\nbroadened into seeing interactions and mergers as important parts of the\noverall evolution of galaxies. The connection becomes more important as we look\nto higher redshift, where more frequent interactions can drive the evolution of\ngalaxies in multiple ways. Links between the properties of central black holes\nand surrounding galaxies makes it important likewise to understand the\nconnections between AGN and interactions, which has remained more ambiguous due\nto the strong role of sample selection. Finally, contemporary data reach deep\nenough to show that most galaxies have interacted in the observable past; we\nmust consider these events to be a normal part of galaxy history.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 2009 09:04:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-13"}

Possible\nemission from spinning dust is identified as a source within a 2' radius of the\nScuba position of the Lynds dark nebula, exhibiting an excess with respect to\nlower frequency radio emission. We find five sources which show a possible\nspinning dust component in their spectra. These sources have rising spectral\nindices in the frequency range 14.2--17.9 GHz. Of these five one has already\nbeen reported, L1111, we report one new definite detection, L675, and three new\nprobable detections (L944, L1103 and L1246). The relative certainty of these\ndetections is assessed on the basis of three criteria: the extent of the\nemission, the coincidence of the emission with the Scuba position and the\nlikelihood of alternative explanations for the excess. Extended microwave\nemission makes the likelihood of the anomalous emission arising as a\nconsequence of a radio counterpart to a protostar or a proto-planetary disk\nunlikely. We use a 2' radius in order to be consistent with the IRAS\nidentifications of dark nebulae (Parker 1988), and our third criterion is used\nin the case of L1103 where a high flux density at 850 microns relative to the\nFIR data suggests a more complicated emission spectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 2009 09:32:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Renewed interest in this old\nproblem is driven by the prospects of detecting gravitational waves from\nstrongly gravitating binaries with extreme mass ratios. We begin here with a\nsummary of recent advances in the theory of gravitational self-interaction in\ncurved spacetime, and proceed to survey some of the ideas and computational\nstrategies devised for implementing this theory in the case of a particle\norbiting a Kerr black hole. We review in detail two of these methods: (i) the\nstandard mode-sum method, in which the metric perturbation is regularized\nmode-by-mode in a multipole decomposition, and (ii) $m$-mode regularization,\nwhereby individual azimuthal modes of the metric perturbation are regularized\nin 2+1 dimensions. We discuss several practical issues that arise, including\nthe choice of gauge, the numerical representation of the particle singularity,\nand how high-frequency contributions near the particle are dealt with in\nfrequency-domain calculations. As an example of a full end-to-end\nimplementation of the mode-sum method, we discuss the computation of the\ngravitational self-force for eccentric geodesic orbits in Schwarzschild, using\na direct integration of the Lorenz-gauge perturbation equations in the time\ndomain. With the computational framework now in place, researchers have\nrecently turned to explore the physical consequences of the gravitational self\nforce; we will describe some preliminary results in this area.

A\nnon-perturbative method giving a controlled error in the long time limit\nremained highly desirable to understand general features of the quench induced\nquantum dynamics. In this paper we show how integrability (via the algebraic\nBethe ansatz) gives one numerical access, in a nearly exact manner, to the\ndynamics resulting from a global interaction quench of an ensemble of fermions\nwith pairing interactions (Richardson's model). This possibility is deeply\nlinked to the specific structure of this particular integrable model which\ngives simple expressions for the scalar product of eigenstates of two different\nHamiltonians. We show how, despite the fact that a sudden quench can create\nexcitations at any frequency, a drastic truncation of the Hilbert space can be\ncarried out therefore allowing access to large systems. The small truncation\nerror which results does not change with time and consequently the method\ngrants access to a controlled description of the long time behavior which is a\nhard to reach limit with other numerical approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 2009 10:53:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-11"}

Although\nthe center object generally is a strong source of these photons, the transfer\nof these photons in the 21 cm region is inefficient, as the optical depth of\nthe photons is large. Consequently, these photons from the source may not be\nable to transfer to the entire 21 cm region timely to provide the W-F coupling.\nThis problem is important because the lifetime of first stars generally is\nshort. The problem is investigated with numerical solution of the\nintegro-differential equation, which describes the kinetics of these resonant\nphotons in both physical and frequency spaces. We show that the photon transfer\nprocess in the physical space is actually coupled to that in the frequency\nspace. Firstly diffusion in the frequency space provides a shortcut for the\ndiffusion in the physical space. It makes the mean time for the escape of the\nresonant photon in optical depth \\tau media roughly proportional to the optical\ndepth \\tau, not \\tau^2. Secondly the resonant scattering is effective in\nbouncing photons with a frequency which is not equal to initial frequency back\nto the initial frequency. This process can restore initial frequency photons\nand establish the local Boltzmann distribution of the photon spectrum around\nthe initial frequency. Therefore, the mechanism of 'escape via shortcut' plus\n'bounce back' enables W-F coupling to be properly realized in the 21 cm region\naround first stars. This mechanism also works for photons injected into the 21\ncm region by redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 2009 12:37:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

In this work, we explore the\nsensitivity of the chemistry of interstellar gas under a wide range of\nconditions. We use these results to predict the relative velocity-integrated\nantenna temperatures of the CO rotational spectrum for several models of high\nredshift active galaxies which may produce both top-heavy and unbiased IMFs. We\nfind that while active galaxies with solar metallicity (and top-heavy IMFs)\nproduce higher antenna temperatures than those with sub-solar metallicity (and\nunbiased IMFs) the actual rotational distribution is similar. The high-J to\npeak CO ratio however may be used to roughly infer the metallicity of a galaxy\nprovided we know whether it is active or quiescent. The metallicity strongly\ninfluences the shape of the IMF. High order CO transitions are also found to\nprovide a good diagnostic for high far-UV intensity and low metallicity\ncounterparts of Milky Way type systems both of which show some evidence for\nhaving top-heavy IMFs. We also compute the relative abundances of molecules\nknown to be effective tracers of high density gas in these galaxy models. We\nfind that the molecules CO and CS may be used to distinguish between solar and\nsub-solar metallicity in active galaxies at high redshift whereas HCN, HNC and\nCN are found to be relatively insensitive to the IMF shape at the large visual\nmagnitudes typically associated with extragalactic sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 2009 14:08:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-23"}

Intermediate Mass (IM) stars are an important component of our Galaxy,\nas they significantly contribute to the interstellar FUV field and,\nconsequently, play an important role in the energy balance of the ISM.

Here we consider in great detail the case of\nthe brightest and closest known young IM protostar: FIR4 in the OMC2 component\nof the Orion molecular cloud complex. Methods. We analyzed the available\ncontinuum emission (maps and SED) through one-dimensional dust radiative\ntransfer calculations. We ran large grids of models to find the envelope model\nthat best fits the data. The derived dust density and temperature profiles have\nbeen then used to compute the gas temperature profile, equating gas cooling and\nheating terms across the envelope. Last, we computed the water line spectrum\nfor various possible values of water abundance. Results. The luminosity of FIR4\nhas been reevaluated to 1000 Lo, making FIR4 definitively an Intermediate Mass\nprotostar. The envelope surrounding FIR4 has a relatively shallow density power\nlaw index, ~ 0.6. The most surprising result is that the gas and dust are\nthermally decoupled in the interior of the envelope, where the dust ices\nsublimate at 100 K. This has important consequences in the interpretation of\nthe line data. We provide the predictions for the water spectrum, and discuss\nin detail the lines which will be observed by the Herschel Space Observatory .\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 2009 14:26:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

According to\nthis result, there exists a distinguished matrix size starting at which one can\ndetermine whether a given covariance matrix belongs to the parameter space by\ndetermining whether all principal submatrices of the distinguished size belong\nto the corresponding parameter space. We show that the distinguished matrix\nsize is equal to four in the one-factor model and six with two factors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 2009 15:42:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-13"}

Behaviour of cars is defined by conditional probability of car\nvelocity depending on the distance and velocity of the car ahead. A system\nconsisting of different cars is modelled by a system of two types of cars\ndiffering in maximal velocity or efficiency of brakes. Starting from\nconditional probabilities and using principle of maximum entropy, probability\ndensities of car velocities and headways are calculated. It is shown that the\nfirst-order phase transition between free flow and congested traffic may be\ndriven by number of fast cars in a system of slow cars, and, as a rule,\nadmixture of cars of superior qualities does not increase but decreases the\ntotal flow. In the system of cars with poor brakes platoons of cars of the same\nvelocity are formed. They are dissolved by a small addition of cars with good\nbrakes. Application of principle of maximum entropy was justified by comparing\nthe results with steady state properties of an equivalent kinetic model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 2009 15:55:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-13"}
