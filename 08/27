Since each source\ngenerates a primary maximum near its true \"Doppler parameters\" (intrinsic\nfrequency and sky position) as well as numerous secondary maxima of the\nF-statistic in Doppler parameter space, a search for multiple sources needs to\ndistinguish between true signals and secondary maxima associated with other,\n\"louder\" signals. Our method does this by applying a coincidence test to reject\ncandidates which are not found at nearby parameter space positions in searches\nusing each of the three TDI variables. For signals surviving the coincidence\ntest, we perform a fully coherent search over a refined parameter grid to\nprovide an accurate parameter estimation for the final candidates.

He had noticed\nthe Pythagorean triple (216,630,666);(216)^2+(630)^2=(666)^2. Note that 216=6^3\nand 666 is the hypotenuse length. The question was then, whether there existed\na digit d and a positive integer k(other than the above); such that d^k is the\nleglength of a Pythagorean triangle whose hypotenuse length has exactly k\ndigits, each being equal to d. In 1999, F.Luca and P.Bruckman, answered the\nabove question in the negative. In 2001, K.Zelator(see [2]), took this question\nfurther and showed that no Pythagorean triangle exists such that one leg has\nlength d^k, while the other leglegth has exactly k digits in its decimal\nexpansion, with each digit bein equal to d.

The\npossible improvements are even greater when nodes perform mutual information\naccumulation using rateless codes. In this paper, we investigate routing\nproblems in such networks. Given a network, a source, and a destination, our\nobjective is to minimize end-to-end transmission delay under energy and\nbandwidth constraints. We provide an algorithm that determines which nodes\nshould participate in forwarding the message and what resources (time, energy,\nbandwidth) should be allocated to each.\n  Our approach factors into two sub-problems, each of which can be solved\nefficiently. For any transmission order we show that solving for the optimum\nresource allocation can be formulated as a linear programming problem. We then\nshow that the transmission order can be improved systematically by swapping\nnodes based on the solution of the linear program. Solving a sequence of linear\nprograms leads to a locally optimal solution in a very efficient manner. In\ncomparison to the proposed cooperative routing solution, it is observed that\nconventional shortest path multihop routing typically incurs additional delays\nand energy expenditures on the order of 70%.\n  Our first algorithm is centralized, assuming that routing computations can be\ndone at a central processor with full access to channel state information for\nthe entire system. We also design two distributed routing algorithms that\nrequire only local channel state information. We provide simulations showing\nthat for the same networks the distributed algorithms find routes that are only\nabout two to five percent less efficient than the centralized algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2009 19:36:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-27"}

Conduction velocity restitution is the simplest\nnontrivial spatially extended problem in excitable media, and in the case of\ncardiac tissue it is an important tool for prediction of cardiac arrhythmias\nand fibrillation. An idealized conduction velocity restitution curve requires\nsolving a nonlinear eigenvalue problem with periodic boundary conditions, which\nin the cardiac case is very stiff and calls for the use of asymptotic methods.\nWe compare asymptotics of restitution curves in four examples, two generic\nexcitable media models, and two ionic cardiac models.

Here we consider an\nescape of nebular LyC from galaxies and examine the consequent spectral energy\ndistribution. It is usually assumed that hydrogen nebular LyC mostly produced\nby bound-free transitions is consumed within photo-ionized nebulae (so-called\n\"on-the-spot\" approximation). However, an escape of the continuum should be\ntaken into account if stellar LyC escapes from galaxies through\n\"matter-bounded\" nebulae. We show that the escaping hydrogen bound-free LyC\nmakes a strong bump just below the Lyman limit. Such a galaxy would be observed\nas a Lyman \"bump\" galaxy. This bump results from the radiation energy\nre-distribution of stellar LyC by nebulae. The strength of the bump depends on\nelectron temperature in nebulae, escape fraction of stellar and nebular LyC,\nhardness of stellar LyC (i.e. metallicity, initial mass function, age and star\nformation history), and IGM attenuation. We can use the bump to find very young\n($\\sim1$ Myr), massive ($\\sim100$ $M_\\odot$), and extremely metal-poor (or\nmetal-free) stellar populations at $z<4$. Because of the bump, 900 \\AA-to-1500\n\\AA luminosity density ratio (per Hz) becomes maximum (2--3 times larger than\nthe stellar intrinsic ratio) when about 40% of the stellar LyC is absorbed by\nnebulae. The total number of escaping LyC photons increases due to the escape\nof nebular LyC but does not exceed the stellar intrinsic one. The radiation\nenergy re-distribution by nebulae reduces the mean energy of escaping LyC only\nby $\\approx10$% relative to that of stellar LyC. Therefore, the effect of the\nescape of nebular LyC on the reionization process may be small.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2009 01:38:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2009 02:03:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

A number of researchers have\npointed out the possibilities of breaking degeneracies between Omega_Matter and\nH0 if there is a CMB independent distance scale accurate to a few percent (Hu\n2005). Current uncertainties in the distance scale are about 10% but future\nobservations, with, for example, the JWST, will be capable of estimating H0 to\nwithin a few percent. A crucial step in this process is the Cepheid PL\nrelation. Recent evidence has emerged that the PL relation, at least in optical\nbands, is nonlinear and that neglect of such a nonlinearity can lead to errors\nin estimating H0 of up to 2 percent. Hence it is important to critically\nexamine this possible nonlinearity both observationally and theoretically.\nExisting PC/PL relations rely exclusively on evaluating these relations at mean\nlight. However, since such relations are the average of relations at different\nphases. Here we report on recent attempts to compare theory and observation in\nthe multiphase PC/PL planes. We construct state of the art Cepheid pulsations\nmodels appropriate for the LMC/Galaxy and compare the resulting PC/PL relations\nas a function of phase with observations. For the LMC, the (V-I) period-color\nrelation at minimum light can have quite a narrow dispersion (0.2-0.3 mags) and\nthus could be useful in placing constraints on models. At longer periods, the\nmodels predict significantly redder (by about 0.2-0.3 mags) V-I colors. We\ndiscuss possible reasons for this and also compare PL relations at various\nphases of pulsation and find clear evidence in both theory and observations for\na nonlinear PL relation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2009 08:16:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The main result is that two HI absorbing systems are detected\nagainst the central region.

This\nbroad component is redshifted by ~80 km/s compared to the systemic velocity,\nwhile the narrow absorption is redshifted ~ 490 km/s. Both HI absorption\ncomponents are spatially resolved at the pc-scale of the VLBI observations. The\nbroad component shows strong gradients in density (or excitation) and velocity\nalong the jet.

Gas located in a thick circum-nuclear toroidal structure cannot be\ncompletely ruled out although it appears difficult to reconcile with the\nobserved morphology and kinematics of the HI.

The experimental K material with purity 0.9995 is supplied by Strem\nChemicals Co. USA. We have distinguished between permanent and induced dipole\nmoments carefully. There is good evidence that a ground state neutral K atom is\npolar atom and has a large permanent EDM, d (K) =2.53\\times10-29C.m. New\nexample of time-reversal violation occurred in K atoms. Why has the linear\nStark effect of K atoms not been observed? The article discussed the question\nthoroughly. The most linear Stark shift of K atoms is only 0.0041nm. It is so\nsmall, in fact, that a direct observation of the shifts is not possible! These\nresults can be repeated in other laboratories.

The stellar\ncomponent of the dwarf is initially in the form of a disk and the galaxy is\nplaced on an eccentric orbit motivated by CDM-based cosmological simulations.\nWe measure the orientation, density and velocity distribution of the stars in\nthe tails. Due to the geometry of the orbit, in the vicinity of the dwarf,\nwhere the tails are densest and therefore most likely to be detectable, they\nare typically oriented towards the MW and not along the orbit. We report on an\ninteresting phenomenon of `tidal tail flipping': on the way from the pericentre\nto the apocentre the old tails following the orbit are dissolved and new ones\npointing towards the MW are formed over a short timescale. We also find a tight\nlinear relation between the velocity of stars in the tidal tails and their\ndistance from the dwarf. Using mock data sets we demonstrate that if dwarf\nspheroidal (dSph) galaxies in the vicinity of the MW are tidally affected their\nkinematic samples are very likely contaminated by tidally stripped stars which\ntend to artificially inflate the measured velocity dispersion. The effect is\nstronger for dwarfs on their way from the peri- to the apocentre due to the\nformation of new tidal tails after pericentre. Realistic mass estimates of dSph\ngalaxies thus require removal of these stars from kinematic samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2009 14:52:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Since the environment of LSBs has been studied\nbefore only on small scales (below 2 Mpc), a study of the galaxy content in the\nvicinity of LSB galaxies on larger scales could add a lot to our understanding\nof the origin of this galaxy class. We used the spectroscopic main galaxy\nsample of the SDSS DR4 to investigate the environmental galaxy density of LSB\ngalaxies compared to the galaxy density in the vicinity of high surface\nbrightness galaxies (HSBs). The environment studies, divided into two redshift\nbins, show that both the low mass, and the more massive LSBs possess an\nenvironment with a lower galaxy density than HSBs. The differences in the\ngalaxy density between LSBs and HSBs are significant on scales between 2 and 5\nMpc, the scales of groups and filaments. To quantify this, we have introduced\nfor the first time the LSB-HSB Antibias. The obtained LSB-HSB Antibias\nparameter has a value of 10%-15%. From these results we conclude that LSBs\nformed in low-density regions of the initial universe and have drifted until\nnow to the outer parts of the filaments and walls of the large-scale structure.\nFurthermore, our results, together with actual cosmological simulations, show\nthat LSBs are caused by a mixture of nature and nurture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2009 14:55:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Such rapid disk dispersal may make the formation of planets\ndifficult, and the shorter disk lifetime with lower metallicity could\ncontribute to the strong metallicity dependence of the well-known\n\"planet-metallicity correlation\", which states the probability of a star\nhosting a planet increases steeply with stellar metallicity.
