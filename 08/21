Pairing\nsymmetries are classified according to the irreducible representations of $\n\\mathbb{T} \\otimes \\mathbb{G}$. We prove a theorem that for any two-dimensional\nrepresentation of this group, a time-reversal symmetry breaking paired state is\nenergetically favorable. This implies that the ground state of any spinless\nfermion Hamiltonian in continuum or on a square lattice with a singly-connected\nFermi surface is always a topological superconductor in the presence of\nattraction in at least one channel. Motivated by this discovery, we examine\nphase diagrams of two specific lattice models with nearest-neighbor hopping and\nattraction on a square lattice and a triangular lattice. In accordance with the\ngeneral theorem, the former model exhibits only a topological $(p + ip)$-wave\nstate, while the latter shows a doping-tuned quantum phase transition from such\nstate to a non-topological, but still exotic $f$-wave superconductor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 2009 16:29:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 2009 14:38:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-27"}

Since the next to leading order corrections in\nthe effective brane action are quadratic in the brane thickness l, we adopt a\nlinear perturbation approach in l^2. The perturbations are general in the sense\nthat they are not restricted to the Rindler zone nor to the near-critical\nsolutions of the unperturbed system. As a result, an unexpected asymmetry in\nthe perturbed system is found. In configurations, where the brane does not\ncross the black hole horizon, the perturbative approach does not lead to\nregular solutions if the number of the brane's spacetime dimensions D>3. This\ncondition, however, does not hold for the horizon crossing solutions.\nConsequently we argue that the presented perturbative approach breaks down for\nsubcritical type solutions near the axis of the system for D>3. Nevertheless,\nwe can discuss topology-changing phase transitions in cases when D=2 or 3, i.e.\nwhen the brane is a 1-dimensional string or a 2-dimensional sheet,\nrespectively.

This thesis presents the design an implementation of a\ndistributed middleware which can automatically execute a legacy application on\nmultiple networked computers by parallelizing it. This middleware runs multiple\ncopies of the binary executable code in parallel on different hosts in the\nnetwork. It wraps up the binary executable code of the legacy application in\norder to capture the kernel level data access system calls and perform them\ndistributively over multiple computers in a safe and conflict free manner. The\nmiddleware also incorporates a dynamic scheduling technique to execute the\ntarget application in minimum time by scavenging the available CPU cycles of\nthe hosts in the network. This dynamic scheduling also supports the CPU\navailability of the hosts to change over time and properly reschedule the\nreplicas performing the computation to minimize the execution time. A prototype\nimplementation of this middleware has been developed as a proof of concept of\nthe design. This implementation has been evaluated with a few typical case\nstudies and the test results confirm that the middleware works as expected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 2009 16:26:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-21"}

For clusters in a wide range of galactic environments\nthis has resulted in fit indices near -2, but on average slightly steeper. A\nfundamental property of the -2 power law function is that the luminosity of the\nbrightest object (L_max) scales linearly with the total number of clusters,\nwhich is close to what is observed. This suggests that the formation of Young\nMassive Clusters (YMCs) is a result of the size of the sample, i.e. when the\nSFR is high it is statistically more likely to form YMCs, but no particular\nphysical conditions are required. In this contribution we provide evidence that\nthe LF of young clusters is not a -2 power law, but instead is curved, showing\na systematic decrease of the (logarithmic) slope from roughly -1.8 at low\nluminosities to roughly -2.8 at high luminosities. The empirical LFs can be\nreproduced by model LFs using an underlying cluster IMF with a Schechter type\ntruncation around M*=2x10^5 M_sun. This value of M* can not be universal since\nYMCs well in excess of this M* are known in merging galaxies and merger\nremnants. Therefore, forming super massive clusters (>10^6 M_sun) probably\nrequires conditions different from those in (quiescent) spiral galaxies and\nhence is not only the result of a size-of-sample effect. From the vertical\noffset a cluster formation efficiency of ~10% is derived. We find indications\nfor this efficiency to be higher when the SFR is higher.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 2009 18:42:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-21"}

The\nsample spans a large range in velocity dispersion (sigma from 30-300 km/s) and\nin luminosity (M_R from -18.7 to -23.2). Estimates of age, total metallicity\n(Z/H) and alpha-element abundance ratio (a/Fe) were derived from\nabsorption-line analysis, using single-burst models. Age, Z/H and a/Fe are all\ncorrelated positively with velocity dispersion, but we also find significant\nresidual trends with luminosity: at given sigma, the brighter galaxies are\nyounger, less alpha-enriched, and have higher Z/H. At face value, these results\nmight suggest that the stellar populations depend on stellar mass as well as on\nvelocity dispersion. However, we show that the observed trends can be\nreproduced by models in which the stellar populations depend systematically\nonly on sigma, and are independent of stellar mass Mstel. For age, the observed\nluminosity correlation arises because young galaxies are brighter, at fixed\nMstel. For metallicity, the observed luminosity dependence arises because\nmetal-rich galaxies, at fixed mass, tend also to be younger, and hence\nbrighter. We find a good match to the observed luminosity correlations with Age\n~ sigma^0.40, Z/H ~ sigma^0.35, a/Fe ~ sigma^0.20, where the slopes are close\nto those found when fitting traditional scaling relations.

The procedure is as\nfollows: We put a spherical wall at the center of de-Sitter spacetime, whose\nmass is negligible and perfectly reflects the Hawking radiation coming from the\ncosmological horizon. Then the region enclosed by the wall and horizon settles\ndown to a thermal equilibrium state, for which the Euclidean action is\nevaluated and the partition function is obtained.

Novel structures and materials have\nbeen studied in order to improve the performance of the magnetic tunnel\njunctions (MTJs) performances and understand the fundamental physics in spin\ntorque transfer. The adiabatic spin torque effect, which is due to the spatial\nnon-uniformity of magnetic properties, has been predicted in theory and\ndemonstrated experimentally in magnetic nanowires. However, this important spin\ntorque has been rarely concerned in the magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJ) because\nof its extremely weak effect in conventional MTJs. This paper reports for the\nfirst time a giant adiabatic spin torque in MTJ devices with a hybrid free\nlayer structure. The generation of the giant adiabatic spin torque was realized\nthrough the introduction of a spatial magnetic non-uniformity in a hybrid free\nlayer along the current direction. It is observed that the giant adiabatic spin\ntorque can substantially promote the current-induced switching process in the\nMTJ devices: the adiabatic spin torque can be larger than the in-plane spin\ntorque, which allows for the switching with a single-polar current under\ndifferent bias fields. Moreover, the adiabatic spin torque, which is\nproportional to the level of spatial non-uniformity, increases during the\nswitching process. The observed effects are confirmed by numerical simulations.\nThese results have far-reaching implications for the future of high-density\nSTT-MRAM devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Aug 2009 04:32:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-24"}

The article describes measurements of coherence properties and uses this\ndiscussion as a base from which to describe partially-coherent diffraction and\nX-ray phase contrast imaging, with its applications in materials science,\nengineering and medicine. Coherent diffraction imaging methods are reviewed\nalong with associated experiments in materials science. Proposals for\nexperiments to be performed with the new X-ray free-electron-lasers are briefly\ndiscussed. The literature on X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy is described\nand the features it has in common with other coherent X-ray methods are\nidentified. Many of the ideas used in the coherent X-ray literature have their\norigins in the optical and electron communities and these connections are\nexplored. A review of the areas in which ideas from coherent X-ray methods are\ncontributing to methods for the neutron, electron and optical communities is\npresented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Aug 2009 07:15:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-09"}

Archival data obtained with the VINCI\ninstrument at the VLTI are used to study the fringe visibility of the Fomalhaut\nsystem at projected baseline lengths ranging from 4 m to 140 m in the K band. A\nsignificant visibility deficit is observed at short baselines with respect to\nthe expected visibility of the sole stellar photosphere.

These waves are present in\nregions of strong inhomogeneities in density or magnetic field (e. g., the\nborder between open and closed magnetic field lines). Using a 3-dimensional\nMagnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model, we calculate the surface Alfven wave damping\ncontribution between 1-4 solar radii, the region of interest for both\nacceleration and coronal heating. We consider waves with frequencies lower than\nthose that are damped in the chromosphere and on the order of those dominating\nthe heliosphere. In the region between open and closed field lines, within a\nfew solar radii of the surface, no other major source of damping has been\nsuggested for the low frequency waves we consider here. This work is the first\nto study surface Alfven waves in a 3D environment without assuming a priori a\ngeometry of field lines or magnetic and density profiles. We determine that\nwaves with frequencies >2.8x10^-4 Hz are damped between 1-4 solar radii. In\nquiet sun regions, surface Alfven waves are damped at further distances\ncompared to active regions, thus carrying additional wave energy into the\ncorona. We compare the surface Alfven wave contribution to the heating by a\nvariable polytropic index and find that it an order of magnitude larger than\nneeded for quiet sun regions. For active regions the contribution to the\nheating is twenty percent. As it has been argued that a variable gamma acts as\nturbulence, our results indicate that surface Alfven wave damping is comparable\nto turbulence in the lower corona. This damping mechanism should be included\nself consistently as an energy driver for the wind in global MHD models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Aug 2009 15:18:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}
