They are very simple to implement as nodes only require local\ninformation to take routing decisions. Also, random walks demand little\nprocessing power and bandwidth. Besides, they are very resilient to changes on\nthe network topology.\n  Here, we quantify the effectiveness of random walks as a search mechanism in\none-hop replication networks: networks where each node knows its neighbors'\nidentity/resources, and so it can reply to queries on their behalf. Our model\nfocuses on estimating the expected average search time of the random walk by\napplying network queuing theory. To do this, we must provide first the expected\naverage search length. This is computed by means of estimations of the expected\naverage coverage at each step of the random walk. This model takes into account\nthe revisiting effect: the fact that, as the random walk progresses, the\nprobability of arriving to nodes already visited increases, which impacts on\nhow the network coverage evolves. That is, we do not model the coverage as a\nmemoryless process. Furthermore, we conduct a series of simulations to\nevaluate, in practice, the above mentioned metrics.

This, in turn, suggests that the level of star formation activity and\nperhaps the star formation rate in these two clouds may be directly\nproportional to the total amount of high extinction material and presumably\nhigh density gas within them and that there might be a density threshold for\nstar formation on the order of a few times 10^4 hydrogen molecules per cc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Aug 2009 19:45:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Under the setting of\nlinear network coding this work provides a comprehensive study of passive\nnetwork tomography in the presence of network (random or adversarial) glitches.\nTo be concrete, this work is developed along two directions: 1. Tomographic\nupper and lower bounds (i.e., the most adverse conditions in each problem\nsetting under which network tomography is possible, and corresponding schemes\n(computationally efficient, if possible) that achieve this performance) are\npresented for random linear network coding (RLNC).

(To justify this, we show an upper bound for the problem of topology\nestimation in networks using RLNC without common randomness.) In this setting\nwe present the first set of algorithms that characterize the network topology\nexactly. Our algorithm for topology estimation with random network errors has\ntime complexity that is polynomial in network parameters. For the problem of\nnetwork error localization given the topology information, we present the first\ncomputationally tractable algorithm to localize random errors, and prove it is\ncomputationally intractable to localize adversarial errors. 2. New network\ncoding schemes are designed that improve the tomographic performance of RLNC\nwhile maintaining the desirable low-complexity, throughput-optimal, distributed\nlinear network coding properties of RLNC.

The main aim of this work is to derive model-independent\nconstraints on the origin of the X-ray emission and on the nature of the\ncentral engine in 3C 390.3. On timescales of the order of few hours, probed by\nuninterrupted XMM light curves, the flux of 3C 390.3 is consistent with being\nconstant in all energy bands. On longer timescales, probed by the 2-day RXTE\nand Suzaku observations, the flux variability becomes significant. The latter\nobservation confirms that the spectral variability behavior of 3C 390.3 is\nconsistent with the spectral evolution observed in radio-quiet Seyfert\ngalaxies: the spectrum softens as the source brightens. The correlated\nvariability between soft and hard X-rays, observed during the Suzaku exposure\nand between the 2 XMM pointings, taken 1 week apart, argues against scenarios\ncharacterized by the presence of two distinct variable components in the 0.5-10\nkeV X-ray band.

Multipath routing protocols have been proposed in the literature to\nmake use of these S-T paths in enhancing the survivability of the S-T\ninformation flow. This is usually accomplished by using a subset of these paths\nto forward redundant data units or combinations (if network coding is allowed)\nfrom S to T. Therefore, this enhancement in survivability reduces the useful\nS-T information rate. In this paper we present a new way to enhance the\nsurvivability of the S-T information flow without compromising the maximum\nachievable S-T information rate. To do this, bottleneck links (in the min-cut)\nshould only forward useful information, and not redundant data units. We\nintroduce the idea of extra source or destination connectivity with respect to\na certain S-T max-flow, and then we study two problems: namely, pre-cut\nprotection and post-cut protection. Although our objective in both problems is\nthe same, where we aim to maximize the number of protected paths, our analysis\nshows that the nature of these two problems are very different, and that the\npre-cut protection problem is much harder.

In this paper, we revisit the relation between these empirical\nfindings, and we quantitatively predict the cosmic evolution of the surface\ndensities of atomic (HI) and molecular (H2) hydrogen in regular galaxies. Our\nmethod uses a pressure-based model for the H2/HI-ratio of the Interstellar\nMedium, applied to ~3*10^7 virtual galaxies in the Millennium Simulation. We\npredict that, on average, the HI-surface density of these galaxies saturates at\nSigma_HI<10 Msun/pc^2 at all redshifts (z), while H2-surface densities evolve\ndramatically as Sigma_H2(1+z)^2.4. This scaling is dominated by a (1+z)^2\nsurface brightness scaling originating from the (1+z)^-1 size scaling of\ngalaxies at high z. Current measurements of Sigma_H2 at high z, derived from\nCO-observations, tend to have even higher values, which can be quantitatively\nexplained by a selection bias towards merging systems. However, despite the\nconsistency between our high-z predictions and the sparse empirical data, we\nemphasize that the empirical data potentially suffer from serious selection\nbiases and that the semi-analytic models remain in many regards uncertain. As a\ncase study, we investigate the cosmic evolution of simulated galaxies, which\nresemble the Milky Way at z=0. We explicitly predict their HI- and\nH2-distribution at z=1.5, corresponding to the CO-detected galaxy BzK-21000,\nand at z=3, corresponding to the primary science goal of the Atacama Large\nMillimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Aug 2009 18:52:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-09"}

This is at least partially due to the fact that if the binary is\nhard enough to evolve to the phase at which it will start emitting\ngravitational waves (GWs) efficiently, there is a good probability that it will\nbe detectable by future space-borne detectors like LISA. We study this\nevolution in the presence of rotation in the cluster. The eccentricity is\nstrongly connected to the initial IMBHs velocities, and values of $\\sim 0.7$ up\nto 0.9 are reached for low initial velocities, while almost circular orbits\nresult if the initial velocities are increased.

Because\nsmall-scale oblique Alfven waves (kinetic Alfven waves) are compressive, the\nmeasured density fluctuations in the solar wind place an upper limit on the\namplitude of kinetic Alfven waves and hence an upper limit on the rate at which\nthe solar wind can be heated by low-frequency, Alfvenic turbulence. We evaluate\nthis upper limit for both coronal holes at 5 solar radii and in the near-Earth\nsolar wind. At both radii, the upper limit we find is consistent with models in\nwhich the solar wind is heated by low-frequency Alfvenic turbulence. At 1 AU,\nthe upper limit on the turbulent heating rate derived from the measured density\nfluctuations is within a factor of 2 of the measured solar wind heating rate.\nThus if low-frequency Alfvenic turbulence contributes to heating the near-Earth\nsolar wind, kinetic Alfven waves must be one of the dominant sources of solar\nwind density fluctuations at frequencies of order 1 Hz. We also present a\nsimple argument for why density fluctuation measurements do appear to rule out\nmodels in which the solar wind is heated by non-turbulent high-frequency waves\n``sweeping'' through the ion-cyclotron resonance, but are compatible with\nheating by low-frequency Alfvenic turbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Aug 2009 21:43:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

As observed in the World Color\nSurvey (WCS), indeed, any two groups of individuals develop quite different\ncategorization patterns, but some universal properties can be identified by a\nstatistical analysis over a large number of populations. Here, we reproduce the\nWCS in a numerical model in which different populations develop independently\ntheir own categorization systems by playing elementary language games. We find\nthat a simple perceptual constraint shared by all humans, namely the human Just\nNoticeable Difference (JND), is sufficient to trigger the emergence of\nuniversal patterns that unconstrained cultural interaction fails to produce. We\ntest the results of our experiment against real data by performing the same\nstatistical analysis proposed to quantify the universal tendencies shown in the\nWCS [Kay P and Regier T. (2003) Proc.

Earth-based studies of this object are fundamental to these missions.\nWe present a mid-infrared spectrum (5-38 microns) of 1999 JU3 obtained with\nNASA's Spitzer Space Telescope in May 2008. These observations place new\nconstraints on the surface properties of this asteroid. To fit our spectrum we\nused the near-Earth asteroid thermal model (NEATM) and the more complex\nthermophysical model (TPM). However, the position of the spin-pole, which is\nuncertain, is a crucial input parameter for constraining the thermal inertia\nwith the TPM; hence, we consider two pole orientations. In the extreme case of\nan equatorial retrograde geometry we derive a lower limit to the thermal\ninertia of 150 J/m^2/K/s^0.5. If we adopt the pole orientation of Abe et al.\n(2008a) our best-fit thermal model yields a value for the thermal inertia of\n700+/-200 J/m^2/K/s^0.5 and even higher values are allowed by the uncertainty\nin the spectral shape due to the absolute flux calibration. The lower limit to\nthe thermal inertia, which is unlikely but possible, would be consistent with a\nfine regolith similar to wthat is found for asteroid 433 Eros. However, the\nthermal inertia is expected to be higher, possibly similar to or greater than\nthat on asteroid 25143 Itokawa. Accurately determining the spin-pole of\nasteroid 162173 will narrow the range of possible values for its thermal\ninertia.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Aug 2009 05:13:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-07"}

The energetics of this X-ray halo and\nits morphological similarity to the radio emission from the galaxy suggest that\nit arises from inverse Compton (IC) scattering, by relativistic electrons in\nthe radio jets, of Cosmic Microwave Background photons and potentially\nfar-infrared photons from the dusty starbursts around this galaxy. The X-ray\nemission has a similar extent and morphology to the Ly-alpha halo around the\ngalaxy, suggesting that it may be ionising this halo. Indeed we find that the\nGHz-radio and X-ray and Ly-alpha luminosities of the halo around 4C60.07 are\nidentical to those of 4C41.17 (also at z=3.8) implying that these three\ncomponents are linked by a single physical process.

The\ndetailed NQR data allow us to identify the NQR transitions and electric field\ngradient (EFG) parameters for 4 cobalt sites and 3 Na sites. The spin-lattice\nand spin-spin relaxation rates are found much smaller for the non-magnetic\nCo$^{3+}$ sites than for the magnetic sites on which the holes are delocalized.\nThe atomic ordering of the Na layers is therefore at the source of this ordered\ndistribution of cobalt charges.

The\nmajority of research in the context of wireless-based localization systems has\nfocused on device-based active localization, in which a device is attached to\ntracked entities. Recently, device-free passive localization (DfP) has been\nproposed where the tracked entity is neither required to carry devices nor\nparticipate actively in the localization process. DfP systems are based on the\nfact that RF signals are affected by the presence of people and objects in the\nenvironment. The DfP concept enables a wide range of applications including\nintrusion detection and tracking, border protection, and smart buildings\nautomation. Previous studies have focused on small areas with direct line of\nsight and/or controlled environments.
