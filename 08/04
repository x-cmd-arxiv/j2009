One\ntechnique employed to reduce the laser frequency noise will be arm locking,\nwhere the laser frequency is locked to the LISA arm length. This paper details\nan implementation of arm locking, studies orbital effects, the impact of errors\nin the Doppler knowledge, and noise limits. The noise performance of arm\nlocking is calculated with the inclusion of the dominant expected noise\nsources: ultra stable oscillator (clock) noise, spacecraft motion, and shot\nnoise. Studying these issues reveals that although dual arm locking [A. Sutton\n& D. A Shaddock, Phys. Rev.

The\ncomputational task becomes that of computing the \"center\" of such a cluster.

We take into\naccount the possibility of anisotropic pairing by also including singlet\nnearest-neighbor interactions, and investigate how the transport properties are\naffected by the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter. This\ncorresponds to an extension of the usual on-site interaction assumption, which\nyields an isotropic s-wave order parameter near the Dirac points. Here, we\nemploy a full numerical solution as well as an analytical treatment, and show\nhow the proximity effect may induce exotic types of superconducting states near\nthe Dirac points, e.g. $p_x$- and $p_y$-wave pairing or a combination of s-wave\nand $p+\\i p$-wave pairing. We find that the Josephson current exhibits a\nweakly-damped, oscillatory dependence on the length of the junction when the\ngraphene sheet is strongly doped. The analytical and numerical treatments are\nfound to agree well with each other in the s-wave case when calculating the\ncritical current and current-phase relationship. For the scenarios with\nanisotropic superconducting pairing, there is a deviation between the two\ntreatments, especially for the effective $p_x$-wave order parameter near the\nDirac cones which features zero-energy states at the interfaces. This indicates\nthat a numerical, self-consistent approach becomes necessary when treating\nanisotropic superconducting pairing in graphene.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2009 20:01:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

In the inner part of the disks,\nour solution converged to the standard $\\alpha$ disks.

The introduced $\\star$-product has\nsome limiting properties what enables us to prove Kostant's problem for\n$\\check{U}_q\\mathfrak g$ in certain cases. We remind the reader that this means\nthat $(L(\\lambda))_{fin}$ coincides with the image of $\\check{U}_q\\g$ in\n$L(\\lambda)$. We also note that if $\\lambda$ is such that\n$<\\lambda,\\alpha_i^\\vee>=0$ for some simple roots $\\alpha_i$ and generic\notherwise, then $(F,\\star)$ is a $\\check{U}_q\\mathfrak g$-invariant\nquantization of the Poisson homogeneous space $G/K$, where $K$ is the\nstabilizer of $\\lambda$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2009 21:23:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2009 19:02:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 4 Oct 2009 21:24:26 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 13 Feb 2010 19:06:55 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2011 23:27:06 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 1 Jun 2012 21:24:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-05"}

It leads to the insight that, if gravity is a fundamental\ninteraction and QM is universally valid, the gravitational field will have to\nbe quantized, not at least because of the inconsistency of semi-classical\ntheories of gravity. If this means to quantize GR, its identification of the\ngravitational field with the spacetime metric has to be taken into account. And\nthe resulting quantum theory has to be background-independent. This can not be\nachieved by means of quantum field theoretical procedures. More sophisticated\nstrategies have to be applied. One of the basic requirements for such a\nquantization strategy is that the resulting quantum theory has GR as a\nclassical limit. - However, should gravity not be a fundamental, but an\nresidual, emergent interaction, it could very well be an intrinsically\nclassical phenomenon. Should QM be nonetheless universally valid, we had to\nassume a quantum substrate from which gravity would result as an emergent\nclassical phenomenon. And there would be no conflict with the arguments against\nsemi-classical theories, because there would be no gravity at all on the\nsubstrate level. The gravitational field would not have any quantum properties,\nand a quantization of GR would not lead to any fundamental theory. The\nobjective of a theory of 'QG' would instead be the identification of the\nquantum substrate from which gravity results. - The paper tries to give an\noverview over the main options for theory construction in the field of QG.\nBecause of the still unclear status of gravity and spacetime, it pleads for the\nnecessity of a plurality of conceptually different approaches to QG.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2009 22:07:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-04"}

We adopt a model used in a\nprevious work that characterizes the QoS requirements of clients by their delay\nconstraints, channel reliabilities, and delivery ratio requirements. In this\nwork, we assume that the utility of a client is a function of the delivery\nratio it obtains. We treat the delivery ratio for a client as a tunable\nparameter by the access point (AP), instead of a given value as in the previous\nwork. We then study how the AP should assign delivery ratios to clients so that\nthe total utility of all clients is maximized.\n  We apply the techniques introduced in two previous papers to decompose the\nutility maximization problem into two simpler problems, a CLIENT problem and an\nACCESS-POINT problem. We show that this decomposition actually describes a\nbidding game, where clients bid for the service time from the AP. We prove that\nalthough all clients behave selfishly in this game, the resulting equilibrium\npoint of the game maximizes the total utility. In addition, we also establish\nan efficient scheduling policy for the AP to reach the optimal point of the\nACCESS-POINT problem. We prove that the policy not only approaches the optimal\npoint but also achieves some forms of fairness among clients.

One of the central problems in this\nprogram is the well-known arbitrariness in choosing a binary operation for\nimplication. To clarify what properties are required to obtain the generalized\ntransfer principle, we introduce a class of binary operations extending the\nimplication on Boolean logic, called generalized implications, including even\nnon-polynomially definable operations. We study the properties of those\noperations in detail and show that all of them admit the generalized transfer\nprinciple. Moreover, we determine all the polynomially definable operations for\nwhich the generalized transfer principle holds. This result allows us to\nabandon the Sasaki arrow originally assumed for Takeuti's model and leads to a\nmuch more flexible approach to quantum set theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2009 00:10:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2017 03:52:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 14 May 2017 03:10:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-05"}

It is often used in combination with the probabilistic method for\nnon-constructive existence proofs. A prominent application is to k-CNF\nformulas, where LLL implies that, if every clause in the formula shares\nvariables with at most d <= 2^k/e other clauses then such a formula has a\nsatisfying assignment. Recently, a randomized algorithm to efficiently\nconstruct a satisfying assignment was given by Moser. Subsequently Moser and\nTardos gave a randomized algorithm to construct the structures guaranteed by\nthe LLL in a very general algorithmic framework. We address the main problem\nleft open by Moser and Tardos of derandomizing these algorithms efficiently.\nSpecifically, for a k-CNF formula with m clauses and d <= 2^{k/(1+\\eps)}/e for\nany \\eps\\in (0,1), we give an algorithm that finds a satisfying assignment in\ntime \\tilde{O}(m^{2(1+1/\\eps)}).

The high equivalent widths of the lines imply a high BLR covering\nfactor, and the absence of clear evidence for absorption by the BLR means that\nthe BLR has a flattened distribution and that we always view it near pole-on.\nThe BLR gas is strongly self-shielding near the equatorial plane.\nVelocity-resolved reverberation mapping has long strongly excluded significant\noutflow of the BLR and shows instead that the predominant motions are Keplerian\nwith large turbulence and a significant net inflow. The rotation and turbulence\nare consistent with the inferred geometry. The blueshifting of high-ionization\nlines is a consequence of scattering off inflowing material rather than the\nresult of an outflowing wind. The rate of inflow of the BLR is sufficient to\nprovide the accretion rate needed to power the AGN. Because the motions of the\nBLR are gravitationally dominated, and the BLR structure is very similar in\nmost AGNs, consistent black hole masses can be determined. The good correlation\nbetween these estimates and masses predicted from the bulge luminosities of\nhost galaxies provides strong support for the similarity of AGN continuum\nshapes and the correctness of the BLR picture presented. It is concluded that\nalthough many mysteries remain about the details of how AGNs work, a general\noverall picture of the torus and BLR is becoming clear.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2009 05:58:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 2009 05:09:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

In the present paper we answer this question\nfor Fe-implanted ZnO single crystals comprehensively. Different implantation\nfluences and temperatures and post-implantation annealing temperatures have\nbeen chosen in order to evaluate the structural and magnetic properties over a\nwide range of parameters. Three different regimes with respect to the Fe\nconcentration and the process temperature are found: 1) Disperse Fe$^{2+}$ and\nFe$^{3+}$ at low Fe concentrations and low processing temperatures, 2)\nFeZn$_2$O$_4$ at very high processing temperatures and 3) an intermediate\nregime with a co-existence of metallic Fe (Fe$^0$) and ionic Fe (Fe$^{2+}$ and\nFe$^{3+}$). Ferromagnetism is only observed in the latter two cases, where\ninverted ZnFe$_2$O$_4$ and $\\alpha$-Fe nanocrystals are the origin of the\nobserved ferromagnetic behavior, respectively. The ionic Fe in the last case\ncould contribute to a carrier mediated coupling. However, their separation is\ntoo large to couple ferromagnetically due to the lack of p-type carrier.

Such gravitational waves are expected from the self ordering of\nrandomly oriented scalar fields which can be present during a thermal phase\ntransition or during preheating after hybrid inflation. We find that, if the\ngravitational wave source acts only during a small fraction of the Hubble time,\nthe gravitational wave spectrum at frequencies lower than the expansion rate at\nthe time of production behaves as $\\Omega_{\\rm GW}(f) \\propto f^3$ with an\namplitude much too small to be observable by gravitational wave observatories\nlike LIGO, LISA or BBO. On the other hand, if the source is active for a much\nlonger time, until a given mode which is initially superhorizon ($k\\eta_* \\ll\n1$), enters the horizon, for $k\\eta \\gtrsim 1$, we find that the gravitational\nwave energy density is frequency independent, i.e. scale invariant.

The\nlow/hard state is explained by the development of a magnetically arrested\naccretion disk attributable to the accumulation of a vertical magnetic field in\na central bundle. This disk forms powerful jets and consists of thin spiral\naccretion streams of a dense optically thick plasma surrounded by hot,\nmagnetized, optically thin corona, which emits most of the energy in hard\nX-rays. State transition occurs because of the quasi-periodic or random\ninversion of poloidal magnetic fields in the accretion flow supplied by the\nsecondary star. The inward advection of the inverted field results in a\ntemporal disappearance of the central bundle caused by the annihilation of the\nopposed fields and restoration of the optically thick disk in the innermost\nregion. This disk represents the high/soft state. The SPL state develops at the\nperiod of intensive field annihilation and precedes the high/soft state. The\ncontinuous supply of the inverted field leads to a new low/hard state because\nof the formation of another magnetically arrested disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2009 12:25:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The isosceles configurations generically lead to a negative\nbispectrum with a power law decay l^(-6) for large multipole l. However,\ncollapsed triangles are found to be associated with a positive bispectrum\nwhereas the squeezed triangles still exhibit negative values.

The star, and its accompanying disk, blow winds inside a cavity\ncleared out by an earlier jet. The collision of the winds with their\nsurroundings generates shock heated plasma which reaches temperatures up to\n~10^8 K. Attenuated X-ray spectra are calculated from solving the equation of\nradiative transfer along lines-of-sight. This process is repeated at various\nepochs throughout the simulations to examine the evolution of the intrinsic and\nattenuated flux. We find that the dynamic nature of the wind-cavity interaction\nfuels intrinsic variability in the observed emission on timescales of several\nhundred years. This is principally due to variations in the position of the\nreverse shock which is influenced by changes in the shape of the cavity wall.\nThe collision of the winds with the cavity wall can cause clumps of cloud\nmaterial to be stripped away. Mixing of these clumps into the winds mass-loads\nthe flow and enhances the X-ray emission measure. The position and shape of the\nreverse shock plays a key role in determining the strength and hardness of the\nX-ray emission. In some models the reverse shock is oblique to much of the\nstellar and disk outflows, whereas in others it is closely normal over a wide\nrange of polar angles. For reasonable stellar and disk wind parameters the\nintegrated count rate and spatial extent of the intensity peak for X-ray\nemission agree with \\textit{Chandra} observations of the deeply embedded MYSOs\nS106 IRS4, Mon R2 IRS3 A, and AFGL 2591.(abridged)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2009 15:18:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

We performed\nobservations at 1.2mm with the IRAM 30m telescope, VLA observations at 6cm,\n3.6cm, 1.3cm, 7mm, and H2O maser and NH3 lines, and observations with the NASA\n70m antenna in CCS and H2O maser. The cm and mm continuum emission, together\nwith the near infrared data from the 2MASS allowed us to identify 3 YSOs, IRS1,\nVLA8A, and VLA8B, with different radio and infrared properties, and which seem\nto be in different evolutionary stages. The NH3 emission consists of three\nclouds. Two of these, MM1 and MM2, are associated with dust emission, while the\nsouthern cloud is only detected in NH3. The YSOs are embedded in MM1, where we\nfound evidence of line broadening and temperature enhancements. On the other\nhand, the southern cloud and MM2 appear to be quiescent and starless. We\nmodeled the radial intensity profile at 1.2mm of MM1. The model fits reasonably\nwell the data, but it underestimates the intensity at small projected distances\nfrom the 1.2mm peak, probably due to the presence of multiple YSOs embedded in\nthe envelope. There is a differentiation in the relative NH3 abundance with low\nvalues, ~2x10^-8, toward MM1, and high values, up to 10^-6, toward the southern\ncloud and MM2, suggesting that these clouds could be in a young evolutionary\nstage. IRAS 00213+6530 is harboring a multiple system of low-mass protostars,\nindicating that star formation in this cloud is taking place in groups, rather\nthan in isolation. The low-mass YSOs found in IRAS 00213+6530 are in different\nevolutionary stages suggesting that star formation is taking place in different\nepisodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2009 15:58:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}
