The\nheavy baryon approach, which relies on a non-relativistic expansion around the\nlimit of infinitely heavy baryon, recovers the usual power counting but\ndestroys some analytic properties of the scattering amplitude. Some years ago,\nBecher and Leutwyler proposed a Lorentz-invariant formulation of chiral\nperturbation theory that maintains the required analytic properties, but at the\nexpense of a less intuitive power counting.\n  Aware of the shortcomings of the heavy baryon formalism, the S\\~ao Paulo\ngroup derived the two-pion exchange component of the nucleon-nucleon potential\nin line with the works of Becher and Leutwyler. A striking result was that the\nlong distance properties of the potential is determined by the specific low\nenergy region of the pion-nucleon scattering amplitude where the heavy baryon\nexpansion fails.

This cavity-based\nmethod involves recording spectra at fixed frequency and field, while sweeping\nthe field orientation. The method is applied to the study of a low-symmetry\nJahn-Teller variant of the spin S = 10 Mn12 SMMs (e.g. Mn12-acetate). The\nlow-symmetry complex is also an SMM, but with a significantly reduced barrier\nto magnetization reversal (Ueff ~ 43 K) and, hence, faster relaxation at low\ntemperature in comparison with the high-symmetry species. Mn12 complexes that\ncrystallize in lower symmetry structures exhibit a tendency for one or more of\nthe Mn(III) Jahn-Teller axes to be abnormally oriented, which is believed to be\nthe cause of the faster relaxation. An extensive HFEPR study of\n[Mn12O12(O2CCH2But)16(H2O)4].CH2Cl2.MeNO2 is presented in order to examine the\ninfluence of the abnormally oriented Jahn-Teller axis on the effective barrier.\nThe reduction in the axial anisotropy, D, is found to be insufficient to\naccount for the nearly 40% reduction in Ueff.

This question was posed in \\cite{rat0903} who\nshowed that the more complex the learner the higher the possibility that his\nmistakes deviate from a true random sequence. In the current paper we report on\nan empirical investigation of this problem. We investigate two characteristics\nof randomness, the stochastic and algorithmic complexity of the binary sequence\nof mistakes. A learner with a Markov model of order $k$ is trained on a finite\nbinary sequence produced by a Markov source of order $k^{*}$ and is tested on a\ndifferent random sequence. As a measure of learner's complexity we define a\nquantity called the \\emph{sysRatio}, denoted by $\\rho$, which is the ratio\nbetween the compressed and uncompressed lengths of the binary string whose\n$i^{th}$ bit represents the maximum \\emph{a posteriori} decision made at state\n$i$ of the learner's model. The quantity $\\rho$ is a measure of information\ndensity. The main result of the paper shows that this ratio is crucial in\nanswering the above posed question. The result indicates that there is a\ncritical threshold $\\rho^{*}$ such that when $\\rho\\leq\\rho^{*}$ the sequence of\nmistakes possesses the following features: (1)\\emph{}low divergence $\\Delta$\nfrom a random sequence, (2) low variance in algorithmic complexity.

The low Lorentz factor part of the ejecta will catch up with the\nhigh Lorentz factor part when the latter is decelerated by the surrounding\nmedium to a comparable Lorentz factor. Such a process will develop a\nlong-lasting weak reverse shock until the whole ejecta are shocked. Meanwhile,\nthe forward shocked materials are gradually supplied with energy from the\nejecta that are catching-up, and thus the temporal decay of the forward shock\nemission will be slower than that without an energy supply. However, the\nreverse shock may be strong. Here, we extend the standard reverse-forward shock\nmodel to the case of radially nonuniform ejecta. We show that this process can\nbe classified into two cases: the thick shell case and the thin shell case.

From the point\nof view of semiclassical analysis, our setting corresponds to performing the\nsemiclassical limit at times of order 1/h, as the characteristic wave-length h\nof the initial data tends to zero. It turns out that, in spite that for fixed h\nevery Wigner distribution satisfies a Liouville equation, their limits are no\nlonger uniquely determined by those of the Wigner distributions of the initial\ndata. We characterize them in terms of a new object, the resonant Wigner\ndistribution, which describes high-frequency effects associated to the fraction\nof the energy of the sequence of initial data that concentrates around the set\nof resonant frequencies in phase-space T^{*}T^{d}. This construction is related\nto that of the so-called two-microlocal semiclassical measures.

In the framework of Stieltjes transform, we obtain density of states,\nwhich is an efficiency measure for the performance of classical and quantum\nmechanical transport processes on graphs, and calculate the spacetime\ntransition probabilities between two vertices of the lattice. Then we\nanalytically show that there are two power law decays $\\sim t^{-3}$ and $\\sim\nt^{-1.5}$ at the beginning of the transport for transition probability in the\ncontinuous-time quantum and classical random walk respectively. This results\nillustrate the decay of quantum mechanical transport processes is quicker than\nthat of the classical one. Due to the result, the characteristic time $t_c$,\nwhich is the time when the first maximum of the probabilities occur on an\ninfinite graph, for the quantum walk is shorter than that of the classical\nwalk. Therefore, we can interpret that the quantum transport speed on spidernet\nis faster than that of the classical one. In the end, we investigate the\nresults by numerical analysis for two examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2009 14:39:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-06"}
