Then we present three applications of groupoidification. The first\nis to Feynman diagrams. The Hilbert space for the quantum harmonic oscillator\narises naturally from degroupoidifying the groupoid of finite sets and\nbijections. This allows for a purely combinatorial interpretation of creation\nand annihilation operators, their commutation relations, field operators, their\nnormal-ordered powers, and finally Feynman diagrams. The second application is\nto Hecke algebras. We explain how to groupoidify the Hecke algebra associated\nto a Dynkin diagram whenever the deformation parameter q is a prime power. We\nillustrate this with the simplest nontrivial example, coming from the A2 Dynkin\ndiagram. In this example we show that the solution of the Yang-Baxter equation\nbuilt into the A2 Hecke algebra arises naturally from the axioms of projective\ngeometry applied to the projective plane over the finite field with q elements.\nThe third application is to Hall algebras. We explain how the standard\nconstruction of the Hall algebra from the category of representations of a\nsimply-laced quiver can be seen as an example of degroupoidification. This in\nturn provides a new way to categorify - or more precisely, groupoidify - the\npositive part of the quantum group associated to the quiver.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Aug 2009 16:16:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2010 07:47:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 21 Oct 2010 08:29:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-22"}

A sub-halo generally induces a localized wave in\nthe stream which often evolves into a \"z-fold\" as an initially trailing\ninnermost part rotates faster than an initially leading outermost part. The\nfolding, which becomes increasingly complex with time, leads to an apparent\nvelocity dispersion increase and thickening of the stream. We measure the\nequivalent velocity dispersion around the local mean in the simulations,\nfinding that it rises to about 10 km/s after 5 Gyr and 20 km/s after 13 Gyr.\nThe currently available measurements of the velocity dispersion of halo star\nstreams range from as small as 2 km/s to slightly over 20 km/s. The streams\nwith velocity dispersions of 15-20 km/s are compatible with what sub-halo\nheating would produce. A dynamical understanding of the low velocity dispersion\nstreams depends on the time since the progenitor's tidal disruption into a thin\nstream. If the streams are nearly as old as their stars then sub-halos cannot\nbe present with the predicted numbers and masses. However, the dynamical age of\nthe streams can be significantly less than the stars. If the three lowest\nvelocity streams are assigned ages of 3 Gyr, they are in conflict with the\nsub-halo heating. The main conclusion is that star stream heating is a powerful\nand simple test for sub-halo structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Aug 2009 16:41:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2009 00:33:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

Our\nproposed reconciliation of general relativity and quantum field theory is based\non a modification of their graphical instantiations, i.e., Regge calculus and\nlattice gauge theory, respectively, which we assume are fundamental to their\ncontinuum counterparts. Accordingly, the fundamental structure is a graphical\namalgam of space, time, and sources (in parlance of quantum field theory)\ncalled a \"spacetimesource element.\" These are fundamental elements of space,\ntime, and sources, not source elements in space and time. The transition\namplitude for a spacetimesource element is computed using a path integral with\ndiscrete graphical action. The action for a spacetimesource element is\nconstructed from a difference matrix K and source vector J on the graph, as in\nlattice gauge theory. K is constructed from graphical field gradients so that\nit contains a non-trivial null space and J is then restricted to the row space\nof K, so that it is divergence-free and represents a conserved exchange of\nenergy-momentum. This construct of K and J represents an adynamical global\nconstraint between sources, the spacetime metric, and the energy-momentum\ncontent of the element, rather than a dynamical law for time-evolved entities.\nWe use this approach via modified Regge calculus to correct proper distance in\nthe Einstein-deSitter cosmology model yielding a fit of the Union2 Compilation\nsupernova data that matches LambdaCDM without having to invoke accelerating\nexpansion or dark energy. A similar modification to lattice gauge theory\nresults in an adynamical account of quantum interference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Aug 2009 17:07:26 GMT"},{"version":"v10","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2013 20:36:07 GMT"},{"version":"v11","created":"Mon, 18 Nov 2013 16:23:49 GMT"},{"version":"v12","created":"Sat, 26 Jul 2014 19:52:57 GMT"},{"version":"v13","created":"Sat, 30 Aug 2014 20:04:34 GMT"},{"version":"v14","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2015 16:28:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2009 02:12:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2009 17:29:33 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 11 Mar 2010 15:58:16 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2011 21:50:06 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sun, 16 Oct 2011 16:45:27 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Sun, 12 Aug 2012 18:01:51 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Fri, 8 Mar 2013 18:10:57 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2013 20:05:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-01"}

Historical events provoked much\ninterest but had little economic impact. However, the widespread adoption of\nadvanced technological infrastructures over the past fifty years gives these\nevents the potential to disrupt those infrastructures - and thus create\nprofound economic and societal impact. However, like all extreme hazards, such\nevents are rare, so we have limited data on which to build our understanding of\nthe events. Many other natural hazards (e.g. flash floods) are highly\nlocalised, so statistically significant datasets can be assembled by combining\ndata from independent instances of the hazard recorded over a few decades. But\nwe have a single instance of space weather so we would have to make\nobservations for many centuries in order to build a statistically significant\ndataset. Instead we must exploit our knowledge of solar-terrestrial physics to\nfind other ways to assess these risks. We discuss three alternative approaches:\n(a) use of proxy data, (b) studies of other solar systems, and (c) use of\nphysics-based modelling. The proxy data approach is well-established as a\ntechnique for assessing the long-term risk from radiation storms, but does not\nyet provide any means to assess the risk from severe geomagnetic storms. This\nlatter risk is more suited to the other approaches. We need to develop and\nexpand techniques to monitoring key space weather features in other solar\nsystems. To make progress in modelling severe space weather, we need to focus\non the physics that controls severe geomagnetic storms, e.g. how can dayside\nand tail reconnection be modulated to expand the region of open flux to envelop\nmid-latitudes?\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Aug 2009 17:28:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-01"}

Till date,\na very little work has been reported for Handwritten Farsi Character\nrecognition. In this paper, we have made an attempt to recognize handwritten\nFarsi characters by using a multilayer perceptron with one hidden layer. The\nerror backpropagation algorithm has been used to train the MLP network. In\naddition, an analysis has been carried out to determine the number of hidden\nnodes to achieve high performance of backpropagation network in the recognition\nof handwritten Farsi characters. The system has been trained using several\ndifferent forms of handwriting provided by both male and female participants of\ndifferent age groups. Finally, this rigorous training results an automatic HCR\nsystem using MLP network. In this work, the experiments were carried out on two\nhundred fifty samples of five writers. The results showed that the MLP networks\ntrained by the error backpropagation algorithm are superior in recognition\naccuracy and memory usage. The result indicates that the backpropagation\nnetwork provides good recognition accuracy of more than 80% of handwritten\nFarsi characters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Aug 2009 11:55:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-01"}

We\nbegin by showing that for a sequence of log-concave densities, convergence in\ndistribution implies much stronger types of convergence -- in particular, it\nimplies convergence in Hellinger distance and even in certain exponentially\nweighted total variation norms. In our main result, we prove the existence and\nuniqueness of a log-concave density that minimises the Kullback--Leibler\ndivergence from the true density over the class all log-concave densities, and\nalso show that the log-concave maximum likelihood estimator converges almost\nsurely in these exponentially weighted total variation norms to this minimiser.\nIn the case of a correctly specified model, this demonstrates a strong type of\nconsistency for the estimator; in a misspecified model, it shows that the\nestimator converges to the log-concave density that is closest in the\nKullback--Leibler sense to the true density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Aug 2009 15:47:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-01"}
