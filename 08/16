Thus, the AGT conjecture is closely related to the\nold belief that conformal theory can be effectively described in the free field\nformalism, and it can actually be a key to clear formulating and proof this\nlong-standing hypothesis.

Further more, the X-ray diffraction data reveal that\nthe c-axis lattice constant c0 increases with the decrease of film thickness.\nThese abnormal phenomena can be attributed to the insufficient oxygen reduction\nin the thin films. Considering the lattice mismatching in the ab-plane between\nthe SrTiO3 substrates and the films, the compressive stress from the substrates\nmay be responsible for the more difficult reduction of the oxygen in the thin\nfilms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Aug 2009 03:01:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The method\nis based on the two main limit theorems of the theory of extreme values and on\nthe derived duality between the Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) and\nGeneralized Extreme Value distribution (GEV). We obtain the distribution of\nmaximum earthquake magnitudes in future time intervals of arbitrary duration\ntau. This distribution can be characterized by its quantile Qq(tau) at any\ndesirable statistical level q. The quantile Qq(tau) provides a much more stable\nand robust characteristic than the traditional absolute maximum magnitude Mmax\n(Mmax can be obtained as the limit of Qq(tau) as q tends to 1, and tau tends to\ninfinity). The best estimates of the parameters governing the distribution of\nQq(tay) for Japan (1923-2007) are the following: Form parameter for GEV =\n-0.1901 +- 0.0717; position parameter GEV(tau=200)= 6.3387 +- 0.0380; spread\nparameter for GEV(tau=200)= 0.5995 +- 0.0223; Q_0.90,GEV(tau=10)= 8.34 +- 0.32.\nWe also estimate Qq(tau) for a set of q-values and future time periods in the\nrange for tau between 1 and 50 years from 2007. For comparison, the absolute\nmaximum estimate Mmax from GEV, which is equal to 9.57 +- 0.86, has a scatter\nmore than twice that of the 90 percent quantile Q_{0.90,GEV}(tau=10) of the\nmaximum magnitude over the next 10 years counted from 2007.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Aug 2009 13:48:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}
