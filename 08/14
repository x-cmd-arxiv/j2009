As an example of\na general scenario, we consider a specific model where the dark matter is a\nfermion in the adjoint representation of a hidden SU(N) gauge group that\nconfines at GeV energies. The absence of light fermionic states in the dark\nsector ensures stability of dark matter on cosmological time scales. Dark\nmatter couples to the standard model via the neutrino portal, that is, the\nsinglet operator H L constructed from the Higgs and lepton doublets, which is\nthe lowest dimensional fermionic singlet operator in the standard model. This\ncoupling prompts dark matter decay where the dominant decay channel has one\nneutrino (and at least one dark glueball) in the final state. Other decay\nchannels with charged standard model particles involve more particles in the\nfinal state and are therefore suppressed by phase space. In consequence, the\nstandard indirect detection signals like gamma-ray photons, antiprotons and\npositrons are suppressed with respect to the neutrino signal. This coupling via\nthe neutrino portal is most robustly constrained by Super-Kamiokande, which\nrestricts the dark matter lifetime to be larger than 10^25 seconds. In the near\nfuture, the scenario will be probed by the new generation of neutrino\ntelescopes.

The large dynamical range in physical conditions\nin accretion disks makes it challenging to address this problem only with\nnumerical simulations. We analyze the concept that (secondary) parasitic\ninstabilities are responsible for the saturation of the MRI. Our approach\nenables us to explore dissipative regimes that are relevant to astrophysical\nand laboratory conditions that lie beyond the regime accessible to current\nnumerical simulations. We calculate the spectrum and physical structure of\nparasitic modes that feed off the fastest, exact (primary) MRI mode when its\namplitude is such that the fastest parasitic mode grows as fast as the MRI. We\nargue that this \"saturation\" amplitude provides an estimate of the magnetic\nfield that can be generated by the MRI before the secondary instabilities\nsuppress its growth significantly.

When the Mach number tends to zero, the compressible Euler equation\nconverges to its incompressible counterpart, in which the density becomes a\nconstant. Increasing approximation errors and severe stability constraints are\nthe main difficulty in the low Mach regime. The key idea of our all speed\nscheme is the special semi-implicit time discretization, in which the low Mach\nnumber stiff term is divided into two parts, one being treated explicitly and\nthe other one implicitly. Moreover, the flux of the density equation is also\ntreated implicitly and an elliptic type equation is derived to obtain the\ndensity. In this way, the correct limit can be captured without requesting the\nmesh size and time step to be smaller than the Mach number. Compared with\nprevious semi-implicit methods, nonphysical oscillations can be suppressed. We\ndevelop this semi-implicit time discretization in the framework of a first\norder local Lax-Friedrich (LLF) scheme and numerical tests are displayed to\ndemonstrate its performances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2009 16:28:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-08"}

In this paper, we study the two-user Gaussian\ninterference channel with conferencing decoders to answer this question in a\nsimple setting. We characterize the fundamental gain from cooperation: at high\nSNR, when INR is below 50% of SNR in dB scale, one-bit cooperation per\ndirection buys roughly one-bit gain per user until full receiver cooperation\nperformance is reached, while when INR is between 67% and 200% of SNR in dB\nscale, one-bit cooperation per direction buys roughly half-bit gain per user.\nThe conclusion is drawn based on the approximate characterization of the\nsymmetric capacity in the symmetric set-up.

We also discuss the prospects for future\ndiscovery of the TeV-scale Kaluza-Klein states that are predicted to emerge in\nthese models, and outline some of the challenges that the detection of such\nparticles pose for experiments at the Large Hadron Collider.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2009 20:11:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Oct 2009 01:12:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-03"}

An entropy-floor model is adopted for planting protogalaxies\nin simulated minihaloes. The model allocates gas quantities such as baryonic\nmass and temperature to every $N$-body particle and extensively exploits the\nparticle nature of the data in the subsequent analysis. We have found that the\nnumber density of simulated minihaloes in the early universe is well described\nby the Sheth & Tormen function and consequently the signal powers of simulated\nminihaloes are far greater than the Press & Schechter prediction presented by\nFurlanetto (2006b). Even though the matter power spectrum measured in the halo\nparticles at $z=15$ is about an order of magnitude smaller than the\nintergalactic medium (IGM), the 21-cm signal fluctuations of haloes are, to the\ncontrary, one order of magnitude higher than the embedding adiabatic IGM on\nscales, $k\\lesssim 10 h{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$.

We have found that the adiabatic signal power on large\nscales lies between the linear predictions of the infinite spin-temperature\nmodel ($T_s\\gg T_{\\rm cmb}$) and the model with the uniform spin temperature\nequal to background value ($T_s = T_s^{bg}$). Higher preheating temperature (or\nhigher background entropy) makes the power spectrum of signals more flattened\nbecause the hotter IGM signals are more thermally broadened and minihalo\nfluctuations dominating on small scales are more severely suppressed by the\nhigher background entropy.

The event was more luminous than the type IIn SN\n2006gy, but exhibited same smooth, slowly evolving light curve. As is\ncharacteristic of type IIn SN, the early spectra of 2008fz initially exhibited\nnarrow Balmer lines which were replaced by a broader component at later times.\nThe spectra also show a blue continuum with no signs of Ca or Na absorption,\nsuggesting that there is little extinction due to intragalatic dust in the host\nor circumstellar material. No host galaxy is identified in prior coadded images\nreaching R ~ 22. From the supernova's redshift, z=0.133, we place an upper\nlimit on the host of M_R=-17.

We have developed a novel Locally Calibrated Pixel (LCP) search\nmethod that uses adjacent regions of the spectrum to calibrate interlopers and\nspectral artifacts, which would otherwise limit the measurement of OVI\nabsorption. Despite the challenges presented by searching for weak OVI within\nthe Lyman-alpha forest in spectra of moderate resolution and signal-to-noise,\nwe find a highly significant detection of absorption by oxygen at 2.7 < z < 3.2\n(the null hypothesis has a chi^2=80 for 9 data points).\n  We interpret our results using synthetic spectra generated from a lognormal\ndensity field assuming a mixed quasar-galaxy photoionizing background (Haardt &\nMadau 2001) and that it dominates the ionization fraction of detected OVI.

We used an\nestablished flux-balance model of metabolism as the basis for a\ngenotype-phenotype map (GPM). We quantified the effects of seven qualitatively\ndifferent environments (corresponding to both carbohydrate and gluconeogenic\nmetabolic substrates) on the structure of this GPM. We found that the GPM has a\nmore rugged structure in qualitatively poorer environments, suggesting that\nadaptive phenotypes could be intrinsically less accessible in such\nenvironments. Nevertheless, on average ~74% of the genotype can be altered by\nneutral drift, in the environment where the GPM is most rugged; this could\nallow evolving populations to circumvent such ruggedness. Furthermore, we found\nthat the normalized mutual information (NMI) of genotype differences relative\nto phenotype differences, which measures the GPM's capacity to transmit\ninformation about phenotype differences, is positively correlated with\n(simulation-based) estimates of the accessibility of adaptive phenotypes in\ndifferent environments.

Furthermore, any spherical\nmetric on the torus with cone singularities of negative curvature and all\nclosed contractible geodesics of length greater than $2\\pi$ is the metric of\nthe Gauss image of some convex polyhedral cusp. This result is an analog of the\nRivin-Hodgson theorem characterizing compact convex hyperbolic polyhedra in\nterms of their Gauss images.\n  The proof uses a variational method. Namely, a cusp with a given Gauss image\nis identified with a critical point of a functional on the space of cusps with\ncone-type singularities along a family of half-lines. The functional is shown\nto be concave and to attain maximum at an interior point of its domain. As a\nbyproduct, we prove rigidity statements with respect to the Gauss image for\ncusps with or without cone-type singularities.\n  In a special case, our theorem is equivalent to existence of a circle pattern\non the torus, with prescribed combinatorics and intersection angles.

In fact, our theorem extends\nThurston's theorem in the same way as Rivin-Hodgson's theorem extends Andreev's\ntheorem on compact convex polyhedra with non-obtuse dihedral angles.\n  The functional used in the proof is the sum of a volume term and curvature\nterm.

A\nmodel for views and derived propagators is introduced. Derived propagators are\nproved to be indeed perfect in that they inherit essential properties such as\ncorrectness and domain and bounds consistency. Techniques for systematically\nderiving propagators such as transformation, generalization, specialization,\nand type conversion are developed. The paper introduces an implementation\narchitecture for views that is independent of the underlying constraint\nprogramming system.

We find that the residual ITN displays, unlike the\noriginal one, marked signatures of a complex system, and is characterized by a\nvery different topological architecture. Whereas the original ITN is\ngeographically clustered and organized around a few large-sized hubs, the\nresidual ITN displays many small-sized but trade-oriented countries that,\nindependently of their geographical position, either play the role of local\nhubs or attract large and rich countries in relatively complex\ntrade-interaction patterns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Aug 2009 15:37:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-18"}

Subject to a smoothness condition, such a family can be\nclosely coupled on short time intervals to a Brownian motion with quadratic\ndrift. This construction is used to determine the first two terms in the\nasymptotic (in n) expansion of the probability that the rescaled chain exits a\nconvex polytope. The constant term and the first correction of size n^{-1/6}\nadmit sharp characterization by solutions to associated differential equations\nand an absolute constant. The error is smaller than O(n^{-b}) for any b < 1/4.\n  These results are directly applied to the analysis of randomized algorithms\nat phase transitions. In particular, the `peeling' algorithm in large random\nhypergraphs, or equivalently the iterative decoding scheme for low-density\nparity-check codes over the binary erasure channel is studied to determine the\nfinite size scaling behavior for irregular hypergraph ensembles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Aug 2009 15:49:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-17"}
