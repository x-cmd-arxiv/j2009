Observational constraints of this rate have all depended on\nanalyzing the chemistry of various molecules that are produced following\ncosmic-ray ionization, and in many cases these analyses contain significant\nuncertainties. Even in the simplest case (H3+) the derived ionization rate\ndepends on an (uncertain) estimate of the absorption path length. In this paper\nwe examine the feasibility of inferring the cosmic-ray ionization rate using\nthe 10830 A absorption line of metastable helium. Observations through the\ndiffuse clouds toward HD 183143 are presented, but yield only an upper limit on\nthe metastable helium column density. A thorough investigation of He+ chemistry\nreveals that only a small fraction of He+ will recombine into the triplet state\nand populate the metastable level. In addition, excitation to the triplet\nmanifold of helium by secondary electrons must be accounted for as it is the\ndominant mechanism which produces He* in some environments. Incorporating these\nvarious formation and destruction pathways, we derive new equations for the\nsteady state abundance of metastable helium. Using these equations in concert\nwith our observations, we find zeta_He < 1.2*10^-15 s^-1, an upper limit about\n5 times larger than the ionization rate previously inferred for this sight line\nusing H3+.

Towards the goal\nof more realistically modeling these auctions, we introduce the Second-Price Ad\nAuctions problem, in which bidders' payments are determined by the GSP\nmechanism. We show that the complexity of the Second-Price Ad Auctions problem\nis quite different than that of the more studied First-Price Ad Auctions\nproblem. First, unlike the first-price variant, for which small constant-factor\napproximations are known, it is NP-hard to approximate the Second-Price Ad\nAuctions problem to any non-trivial factor. Second, this discrepancy extends\neven to the 0-1 special case that we call the Second-Price Matching problem\n(2PM). In particular, offline 2PM is APX-hard, and for online 2PM there is no\ndeterministic algorithm achieving a non-trivial competitive ratio and no\nrandomized algorithm achieving a competitive ratio better than 2. This stands\nin contrast to the results for the analogous special case in the first-price\nmodel, the standard bipartite matching problem, which is solvable in polynomial\ntime and which has deterministic and randomized online algorithms achieving\nbetter competitive ratios. On the positive side, we provide a 2-approximation\nfor offline 2PM and a 5.083-competitive randomized algorithm for online 2PM.\nThe latter result makes use of a new generalization of a classic result on the\nperformance of the \"Ranking\" algorithm for online bipartite matching.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2009 23:46:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-21"}

It is unlike any known\nform of matter or energy and has been detected so far only by its gravitational\neffect of repulsion. Owing to its effects being discernible only at very very\nlarge distance scales, dark energy was only detected at the turn of the last\ncentury when technology had advanced enough to observe a greater part of the\nuniverse in finer detail. The aim of the report is to gain a better\nunderstanding of the mysterious dark energy. To this end, both theoretical\nmethods and observational evidence are studied. Three lines of evidence,\nnamely, the redshift data of type Ia supernovae, estimates of the age of the\nuniverse by various methods, and the anisotropies in the cosmic background\nradiation, build the case for existence of dark energy. The supernova data\nindicate that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. The ages of the\noldest star clusters in the universe indicate that the universe is older than\npreviously thought to be. The anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background\nradiation suggest that the universe is globally spatially flat. If one agrees\nthat the dynamics of the geometry of the universe is dictated by its\nenergy-momentum content through Einstein's general theory of relativity, then\nall these independent observations lead to the amazing conclusion that the\namount of energy in the universe that is presently accounted for by matter and\nradiation is not enough to explain these phenomena. One of the best and\nsimplest explanations for dark energy is the cosmological constant. While it\ndoes not answer all questions, it certainly does manage to explain the\nobservations. The following report examines in some detail the dark energy\nproblem and the candidacy of the cosmological constant as the right theory of\ndark energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 2009 04:19:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2009 04:31:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-25"}

It is based on\nthe fact that if we have a feedback controller, and we learn to compute the\ngradient grad-J of its cost-to-go function, then we can use that gradient to\ndefine a better controller. We can then use the new controller's grad-J to\ndefine a still-better controller, and so on. Here I point out that GHJB works\nindirectly in the sense that it doesn't learn the best approximation to grad-J\nbut instead learns the time derivative dJ/dt, and infers grad-J from that. I\nshow that we can get simpler and lower-cost controllers by learning grad-J\ndirectly. To do this, we need teaching signals that report grad-J(x) for a\nvaried set of states x. I show how to obtain these signals, using the GHJB\nequation to calculate one component of grad-J(x) -- the one parallel with dx/dt\n-- and computing all the other components by backward-in-time integration,\nusing a formula similar to the Euler-Lagrange equation.

We show that\ncompared to maximum likelihood, the loss of efficiency of the proposed method\nis relatively small when the model is correctly specified. The proposed\nequations formalize the ad-hoc regression on factor scores procedure, and\ngeneralize regression calibration. We propose two weighting schemes for the\nequations, and compare their efficiency. We apply this method to a study of the\neffects of in-utero lead exposure on child development.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 2009 09:27:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-21"}

Our simulations use a shearing-box formulation\nto study the evolution of dust grains locally within the disc, and collectively\nour simulations span the entire extent of a typical accretion disc. The dust is\nstirred by gas that undergoes MRI-driven turbulence. This establishes a steady\nstate scale height for the dust that is different for dust of different sizes.\nThis sedimentation of dust is an important first step in planet formation and\nwe predict that ALMA should be able to observationally verify its existence.\nWhen significant sedimentation occurs, the dust will participate in a streaming\ninstability that significantly enhances the dust density. We show that the\nstreaming instability is pervasive in the outer disc. We characterize the scale\nheights of dust whose size ranges from a few microns to a few centimeters. We\nfind that for spherical grains, a power-law relationship develops for the scale\nheight with grain size, with a slope that is slightly steeper than -1/2. The\nsedimentation is strongest in the outer disc and increases for large grains.\nThe results presented here show that direct measurements of grain settling can\nbe made by ALMA and we present favorable conditions for observability. The\nstreaming instability should also be directly observable and we provide\nconditions for directly observing it.

With T_Curie = 3 K and T_SC = 0.6 K\nit is near a quantum phase transition; the pressure needed to suppress the\nmagnetism is slightly higher than 1 GPa. We report simultaneous resistivity and\nac-susceptibility measurements under pressure on a polycrystal with very large\nsingle-crystalline domains and a resistivity ratio of about 6. Both methods\nconfirm the phase diagram established before by resistivity measurements on a\npolycrystal. The ferromagnetic phase is suppressed for P approximately 1.2 GPa.\nAstonishingly, the superconductivity persists at pressures up to at least 2.4\nGPa. In other superconducting and ferromagnetic heavy fermion compounds like\nUGe2 and URhGe, the superconducting state is situated only inside the larger\nferromagnetic region. Therefore, UCoGe seems to be the first example where\nsuperconductivity extends from the ferromagnetic to the paramagnetic region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 2009 15:17:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}
