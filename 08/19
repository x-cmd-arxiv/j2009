This system produces large-scale magnetic fields that also\nshow a sinusoidal variation in the streamwise direction.

Fortunately, the Fermi-LAT diffuse gamma\nray measurements can further test these models, since the electrons and\npositrons produce gamma rays in their interactions in the interstellar medium.\nAlthough the dark matter gamma ray signal consistent with the local electron\nand positron measurements should be quite large, as we review, there are\nsubstantial uncertainties in the modeling of diffuse backgrounds and,\nadditionally, experimental uncertainties that make it difficult to claim a dark\nmatter discovery. In this paper, we introduce an alternative method for\nunderstanding the diffuse gamma ray spectrum in which we take the intensity\nratio in each energy bin of two different regions of the sky, thereby canceling\ncommon systematic uncertainties. For many spectra, this ratio fits well to a\npower law with a single break in energy.

We here analyze the\nradio spectral index over 6.7 yr from Green Bank Interferometer data at 2.2 GHz\nand 8.3 GHz. We find two new characteristics in the radio emission. The first\ncharacteristic is that the periodic outbursts indeed consist of two consecutive\noutbursts; the first outburst is optically thick, whereas the second outburst\nis optically thin. The spectrum of LS I +61 303 is well reproduced by the\nshock-in-jet model commonly used in the context of microquasars and AGNs: the\noptically thin spectrum is due to shocks caused by relativistic plasma\n(\"transient jet\") traveling through a pre-existing much slower steady flow\n(\"steady jet\"). This steady flow is responsible for the preceding optically\nthick spectrum. The second characteristic we find is that the observed spectral\nevolution, from optically thick to optically thin emission, occurs twice during\nthe orbital period. We observed this occurrence at the orbital phase of the\nmain 26.5 d outburst and also at an earlier phase, shifted by $\\Delta \\Phi\n\\sim$ 0.3 (i.e almost 8 days before).

In metals with DOS constant on the scale of phonon\nenergies, the electron-phonon renormalizations drop out of the dressed DOS,\nhowever, due to the Dirac nature of the electron dynamics in graphene, the band\nDOS is linear in energy and phonon structures remain, which can be emphasized\nby taking an energy derivative. There is a shift in the chemical potential and\nin the position in energy of the Dirac point. Also, the DOS can be changed from\na linear dependence out of value zero at the Dirac point to quadratic out of a\nfinite value. The optical scattering rate $1/\\tau$ sets the energy scale for\nthe rise of the optical conductivity from its universal DC value $4e^2/\\pi h$\n(expected in the simplest theory when chemical potential and temperature are\nboth $\\ll 1/2\\tau$) to its universal AC background value $(\\sigma_0=\\pi\ne^2/2h)$. As in ordinary metals the DC conductivity remains unrenormalized\nwhile its AC value is changed. The optical spectral weight under the intraband\nDrude is reduced by a mass renormalization factor as is the effective\nscattering rate. Optical weight is transferred to an Holstein phonon-assisted\nside band.

Its\nreceived flux varies greatly due to interstellar scintillation and it has a\nvery small dispersion measure of DM=4.7pc/cc, implying a distance of ~0.4kpc\nand possibly the smallest luminosity of any known radio pulsar.

Although bulge globular clusters have RR Lyraes that divide\ninto two reasonable distinct groups according to the average period of the RR0\nLyraes (Oosterhoff 1939), there is no evidence of a gap between Oosterhoff I\nand II stars in the bulge field star sample. The majority of the bulge RR0\nLyrae field star population have a difference in period compared to the\nOosterhoff I cluster M3 (Delta log P) that is shifted by about 0.02 days with\nregard to the Milky Way Oosterhoff I population, and the sample includes stars\nwith Delta log P > 0.06 days, a characteristic hardly seen in Milky Way\nglobular clusters.

These\nabundance ratios are confirmed by co-adding low S/N HIRES spectra of 19 stars\nalong the red giant branch.\n  Results: Pal 3 shows alpha-enhanced abundance patterns, and also its Fe-peak\nand neutron-capture element ratios, are fully compatible with those found in\nhalo field stars and representative inner halo GCs of the same metallicity\n(such as M 13).

In the\nsecond protocol, a harmonic oscillator is coupled with the fluctuation and\nmeasured in order to obtain continuous-variable information about the\nfluctuation. In the spin protocol, the amount of teleported energy is\nsuppressed by an exponential damping factor when the amount of input energy\nincreases.

To understand these\ncomplex displays both empirical data and models are needed. Whereas detailed\nempirical data were recently collected through video recordings and position\nmeasurements by stereo photography of flocks of thousands of starlings, there\nare as yet no models that generate these complex patterns. Numerous computer\nmodels in biology, however, suggest that patterns of single groups of moving\nanimals may emerge by self-organisation from movement and local coordination\n(through attraction, alignment and avoidance of collision). In this paper, we\ninvestigated whether this approach can be extended to generate patterns\nresembling these aerial displays of starlings. We show in a model that to\ngenerate many of the patterns measured empirically in real starlings we have to\nextend the usual rules of local coordination with specifics of starling\nbehaviour, mainly 1) their aerial locomotion, 2) a low and constant number of\ninteraction-partners and 3) preferential movement above a roosting area. Our\nmodel can be used as a tool for the study of these displays, because it\nprovides new integrative hypotheses about the mechanisms underlying these\ndisplays and of swarming patterns in biological systems in general.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2009 05:32:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-26"}

There is further evidence for a close to the\ntribimaximal mixing pattern which subsumes `mu-tau' symmetry. On the other\nhand, the assumption of a (maximally allowed) four zero texture in the Yukawa\ncoupling matrix Y_nu in the same basis leads to a highly constrained and\npredictive theoretical scheme. We show that the requirement of an exact\n`mu-tau' symmetry, coupled with observational constraints, reduces the `seventy\ntwo' allowed textures in such a `Y_nu' to 'only four' corresponding to just two\ndifferent forms of the light neutrino mass matrix `m_nu'.

The analysis is performed considering a numerical\napproach (Boundary Element Method). Two main cases are considered : a shallow\ndeposit in the centre of Nice (France) [1] and a deep irregular basin in\nCaracas (Venezuela) [2]. The amplification of seismic motion is analysed in\nterms of level, occuring frequency and location. For both sites, the\namplification factor is found to reach maximum values of 20 (weak motion). Site\neffects nevertheless have very different features concerning the frequency\ndependence and the location of maximum amplification. For the shallow deposit\nin Nice, the amplification factor is very small for low frequencies and fastly\nincreases above 1.0 Hz. The irregular Caracas basin gives a much different\nfrequency dependence with many different peaks at various frequencies. The\nmodel for Caracas deep alluvial basin also includes a part of the local\ntopography such as the nearest mountain. One can estimate seismic site effects\ndue to both velocity contrast (between the basin and the bedrock) and local\ntopography of the site. Furthermore, the maximum amplification is located on\nthe surface for Nice, whereas some strong amplification areas also appear\ninside the basin itself in the case of Caracas. One investigates the influence\nof this focusing effect on the motion vs depth dependence. This is of great\ninterest for the analysis of seismic response of underground structures. The\nform and the depth of alluvial deposits are then found to have a great\ninfluence on the location of maximum amplification on the surface but also\ninside the deposit for deep irregular basins. It is essential for the analysis\nof the seismic response of both surface and underground structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2009 09:58:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-20"}

We analyze the counterintuitive relationship between\nspatial entanglement and Coulomb interaction, which connects maxima (minima) of\nthe first to minima (maxima) of the latter. We introduce a potential quantum\nphase transition which relates quantum states characterized by different\nspatial topology. Finally we show that by varying shape, range and strength of\nthe confinement potential, it is possible to induce strong and rapid variations\nof the entanglement between the two electrons. This property may be used to\ntailor nanostructures according to the level of entanglement required by a\nspecific application.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2009 11:21:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2009 15:45:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The disk-averaged magnetic-field strength ratio R =\nB(523.3)/B(525.0) equals 1.97 +- 0.02. The center-to-limb variation (CLV) is R\n= 1.74 - 2.43 mu + 3.43 mu^2, where mu is the cosine of the center-to-limb\nangle.

We model the superconductor as\nan array of intrinsic Josephson junctions. The superconducting parameters are\ndefined by our preliminary measurements with melt-textured samples. We write\nexplicitly and solve numerically the Josephson equations which give the normal\nand super components of the total current in the superconductor, and derive\nfrom this the total available power P=IV. Then, assuming that the coefficients\nA and B for spontaneous and stimulated gravitational emission are known, we\napply to this case the Frantz-Nodvik equation for a laser amplifier. The\nequation is suitably modified in order to allow for a \"continuous pumping\"\ngiven by an oscillating transport current. The conclusions are relevant for the\nevaluation of gravitational emission from superconductors. We find that even if\nthe A and B coefficients are anomalously large (possibly because of the Quantum\nGravity effects mentioned above), the conditions for stimulated emission are\nquite strict and the emission rate strongly limited by the IV value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2009 13:11:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-20"}

An initially fully polarized spin first decays towards a\nquasiequilibrium determined by the dynamical asymmetry, thereby showing\ncoherent damped oscillations on the (fast) time scale of the spin splitting. On\ntop of this, the dynamical asymmetry itself decays on an ultraslow time scale\nand vanishes asymptotically since the global equilibrium phase is symmetric. We\nquantitatively study the nature of the initial fast decay to the\nquasiequilibrium and discuss the features of ultraslow dynamics of the\nquasiequilibrium itself. The dynamical asymmetry is more pronounced for smaller\nvalues of the sub-Ohmic exponent and for lower temperatures, which emphasizes\nthe quantum many-body nature of the effect. The symmetry breaking is related to\nthe dynamic crossover between coherent and overdamped relaxation of the spin\npolarization and is not connected to the localization quantum phase transition.\nIn addition to this delocalized phase, we identify a novel phase which is\ncharacterized by damped coherent oscillations in the localized phase.

The charm-quark DIS\ncontribution is calculated in a general-mass variable-flavor-number (GMVFN)\nscheme interpolating between the zero-mass 4-flavor scheme at asymptotically\nlarge values of momentum transfer $Q^2$ and the 3-flavor scheme prescription of\nBuza-Matiounine-Smith-van Neerven (BMSN) at the value of $Q^2 = m_c^2$. The\nresults in the GMVFN scheme are compared with those of the fixed-flavor scheme\nand other prescriptions used in global fits of PDFs. The strong coupling\nconstant is measured at an accuracy of $\\approx 1.5%$.

As a mode of locomotion it is\nprimitive and relatively simple, yet can be remarkably robust. No wonder then,\nthat it is so prevalent across a range of biological scales from motile\nbacteria to gigantic prehistoric snakes. Key to understanding undulatory\nlocomotion is the body's interplay with the physical environment, which the\nswimmer or crawler will exploit to generate propulsion, and in some cases, even\nto generate the underlying undulations. This review focuses by and large on\nundulators in the low Reynolds numbers regime, where the physics of the\nenvironment can be much more tractable. We review some key concepts and\ntheoretical advances, as well as simulation tools and results applied to\nselected examples of biological swimmers. In particular, we extend the\ndiscussion to some simple cases of locomotion in non-Newtonian media as well as\nto small animals, in which the nervous system, motor control, body properties\nand the environment must all be considered to understand how undulations are\ngenerated and modulated. To conclude, we review recent progress in microrobotic\nundulators that may one day become commonplace in applications ranging from\ntoxic waste disposal to minimally invasive surgery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2009 15:22:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-20"}

Our simulations, in agreement with spacecraft\ndata, identify a spectral break in turbulence spectra at characteristic\nlength-scales associated with electromagnetic fluctuations that are smaller\nthan the ion gyroradius. In this regime, our 3D simulations show that turbulent\nspectral cascades in the presence of a mean magnetic field follow an\nomnidirectional anisotropic inertial range spectrum close to $k^{-7/3}$. The\nonset of the spectral break in our simulations can be ascribed to the presence\nof nonlinear Hall interactions that modify the spectral cascades. Our\nsimulations further show that the underlying charachteristic turbulent\nfluctuations are spectrally anisotropic, the extent of which depends critically\non the local wavenumber. The fluctuations associated with length scales smaller\nthan the ion gyroradius are highly compressible and tend to exhibit a near\nequipartition in the velocity and magnetic fields.
