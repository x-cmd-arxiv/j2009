The interactions\nhave a repulsive part between the atomic centers and an attraction between the\narm ends of different atoms. For each atom pair only the closest pair of arms\ninteracts attempting to form the bond. This is a picture of sigma bonds, the pi\nbonds are modeled by alignment of additional internal vectors which might\ncharacterize a given atom. Also these are primarily pair interactions. Thus\nthere are only pair interactions of several types present. The intrinsic\narrangement of the model elements, arms and internal vectors can be switched\ndepending on the environment. Thus the complexity of the many-body potentials\nis replaced by pair interactions between atoms with complex internal behaviour.\nThe proposed model thus allows formation of new geometries, establishing new\nand breaking existing bonds with the use of only pair interactions and\nenvironment scanning.

We use a theoretical model to assess whether such\nswitching is a good strategy for growth in environments with occasional\ncatastrophic events. We find that switching can be advantageous, but only when\nthe environment is responsive to the microbial population. In our model,\nmicrobes switch randomly between two phenotypic states, with different growth\nrates. The environment undergoes sudden \"catastrophes\", the probability of\nwhich depends on the composition of the population. We derive a simple\nanalytical result for the population growth rate. For a responsive environment,\ntwo alternative strategies emerge. In the \"no switching\" strategy, the\npopulation maximises its instantaneous growth rate, regardless of catastrophes.\nIn the \"switching\" strategy, the microbial switching rate is tuned to minimise\nthe environmental response.

Statistical descriptors such as\nthe $n$-body distribution function $g_n$ is usually employed to characterize\nthe point configurations, among which the most extensively used is the pair\ndistribution function $g_2$. An intriguing inverse problem of practical\nimportance that has been receiving considerable attention is the degree to\nwhich a point configuration can be reconstructed from the pair distribution\nfunction of a target configuration. Although it is known that the pair-distance\ninformation contained in $g_2$ is in general insufficient to uniquely determine\na point configuration, this concept does not seem to be widely appreciated and\ngeneral claims of uniqueness of the reconstructions using pair information have\nbeen made based on numerical studies. In this paper, we introduce the idea of\nthe distance space, called the $\\mathbb{D}$ space. The pair distances of a\nspecific point configuration are then represented by a single point in the\n$\\mathbb{D}$ space. We derive the conditions on the pair distances that can be\nassociated with a point configuration, which are equivalent to the\nrealizability conditions of the pair distribution function $g_2$.

By explicitly constructing a variety of degenerate point configurations\nusing the $\\mathbb{D}$ space, we show that pair information is indeed\ninsufficient to uniquely determine the configuration in general.

In this situation we find that the absorption probability is\nboth better than analogous coherent light (due to frequency entanglement) and\nhighly dependent on the optical setup. We show that the poor production rates\nof quantum states of light may be partially mitigated by adjusting the spectral\nparameters to improve their two-photon absorption rates. This work has\napplication to quantum imaging, particularly quantum lithography, where the\nN-photon absorbing process in the lithographic resist must be optimized for\npractical applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Aug 2009 18:37:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-11"}

Consideration of mean\nfield magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in these disks shows that magnetic effects\nproduce subkeplerian rotation curves and truncate the inner disk. This letter\nexplores the ramifications of these predicted disk properties for the migration\nof extrasolar planets. Subkeplerian flow in gaseous disks drives a new\nmigration mechanism for embedded planets and modifies the gap opening processes\nfor larger planets. This subkeplerian migration mechanism dominates over Type I\nmigration for sufficiently small planets (m_P < 1 M_\\earth) and/or close orbits\n(r < 1 AU). Although the inclusion of subkeplerian torques shortens the total\nmigration time by only a moderate amount, the mass accreted by migrating\nplanetary cores is significantly reduced. Truncation of the inner disk edge\n(for typical system parameters) naturally explains final planetary orbits with\nperiods P=4 days. Planets with shorter periods P=2 days can be explained by\nmigration during FU-Ori outbursts, when the mass accretion rate is high and the\ndisk edge moves inward. Finally, the midplane density is greatly increased at\nthe inner truncation point of the disk (the X-point); this enhancement, in\nconjunction with continuing flow of gas and solids through the region, supports\nthe in situ formation of giant planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Aug 2009 19:59:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

We investigate the predictions of four currently favoured\nsemi-analytical galaxy formation models applied to the Millennium simulation\nfor the mass function of cold neutral gas (atomic and molecular) in galaxies as\na function of redshift, and we use these predictions to construct number counts\nfor the next generation of all-sky neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) surveys.\nDespite the different implementations of the physical ingredients of galaxy\nformation, we find that the model predictions are broadly consistent with one\nanother; the key differences reflect how the models treat AGN feedback and how\nthe timescale for star formation evolves with redshift.

Star formation then resumed and has\nproceeded until the current time at an average rate of roughly 0.2 solar\nmasses/yr, with temporal variations at the factor-of-two level.

Currently, data pre-processing\nsuch as dimension reduction input values and pre-training are the contributing\nfactors in developing efficient techniques for reducing training time with high\naccuracy and initialization of the weights is the important issue which is\nrandom and creates paradox, and leads to low accuracy with high training time.\nOne good data preprocessing technique for accelerating BPN classification is\ndimension reduction technique but it has problem of missing data. In this\npaper, we study current pre-training techniques and new preprocessing technique\ncalled Potential Weight Linear Analysis (PWLA) which combines normalization,\ndimension reduction input values and pre-training. In PWLA, the first data\npreprocessing is performed for generating normalized input values and then\napplying them by pre-training technique in order to obtain the potential\nweights. After these phases, dimension of input values matrix will be reduced\nby using real potential weights.

The X-ray\ncounterparts to hot, massive stars have been searched for in these catalogs.\nResults : About 300 OB stars were detected with XMM. Half of them were bright\nenough for a spectral analysis to be possible, and we make available the\ndetailed spectral properties that were derived. The X-ray spectra of O stars\nare represented well by low (<1keV) temperature components and seem to indicate\nthat an absorption column is present in addition to the interstellar\ncontribution. The X-ray fluxes are well correlated with the bolometric fluxes,\nwith a scatter comparable to that of the RASS studies and thus larger than\nfound previously with XMM for some individual clusters. These results contrast\nwith those of B stars that exhibit a large scatter in the L_X-L_BOL relation,\nno additional absorption being found, and the fits indicate a plasma at higher\ntemperatures. Variability (either within one exposure or between multiple\nexposures) was also investigated whenever possible: short-term variations are\nfar more rare than long-term ones (the former affects a few percent of the\nsample, while the latter concerns between one third and two thirds of the\nsources).

MNRAS 376, 1099 (2007)","categories":"astro-ph.IM","license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","abstract":"  One of the problems of producing spectrographs for Extremely Large Telescopes\n(ELTs) is that the beam size is required to scale with telescope aperture if\nall other parameters are held constant, leading to enormous size and implied\ncost. This is a particular problem for image sizes much larger than the\ndiffraction limit, as is likely to be the case if Adaptive Optics systems are\nnot initially able to deliver highly corrected images over the full field of\nthe instrument or if signal/noise considerations require large spatial samples.\nIn this case, there is a potential advantage in image slicing to reduce the\neffective slitwidth and hence the beam size. However, this implies larger\ndetectors and oversizing of the optics which may cancel out the advantage. By\nthe means of a toy model of a spectrograph whose dimensions are calibrated\nusing existing instruments, the size and relative cost of spectrographs for\nELTs have been estimated. Using a range of scaling laws derived from the\nreference instruments, it is possible to estimate the uncertainties in the\npredictions and to explore the consequences of different design strategies. The\nmodel predicts major cost savings (2 - 100x) by slicing with factors of 5-20\ndepending on the type of spectrograph. The predictions suggest that it is\nbetter to accommodate the multiplicity of slices within a single spectrograph\nrather than distribute them among smaller, cheaper replicas in a parallel\narchitecture, but the replication option provides an attractive upgrade path to\nintegral field spectroscopy (IFS) as the input image quality is improved...\n[Full abstract in text]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Aug 2009 08:49:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-12"}

In the\nS-breaking, s-particles get their masses and form s-galaxies etc., while\nv-fermions and v-gauge bosons are still massless and form v-SU(5) singlets.\nThere is no interaction among the v-SU(5) color-single states except\ngravitation so that they distribute loosely in space, cannot be observed and\ncause space to expand with an acceleration. When temperature increases to the\ncritical temperature because space contracts, masses of all particles are zero\nso that s-particles and v-particles transform from one to another and the\ngravitational mass density becomes negative. Consequently, space stop to\ncontract and inflation must occur. After reheating, space first expands with a\ndeceleration and then expands with an acceleration up to now. There is no\nspace-time singularity. There are the critical temperature, the highest\ntemperature and the least scale in the universe. A formula describing\ndistance-redshift is obtained.
