An agent drives forward at a\nconstant velocity and uses the sensor to turn right when it is too close to an\nobject and left when it is too far away.\n  For a flat wall the agent stays a fixed distance from the wall and travels\nalong it, regardless of the sensor's capabilities. But, if the wall represents\na periodic function, the agent drives on a periodic path when the sensor has a\nnarrow field of view. The agent's trajectory transitions to chaos when the\nsensor's field of view is increased.

Viscous hydrodynamics provides a tool that\ncan attack this problem and which may work in regions where ideal hydrodynamics\nbegins to fail.\n  This thesis focuses on viscous hydrodynamics for relativistic heavy ion\ncollisions. We first review the 2nd order viscous equations obtained from\ndifferent approaches, and then report on the work of the Ohio State University\ngroup on setting up the equations for causal viscous hydrodynamics in 2+1\ndimensions and solving them numerically for central and noncentral Cu+Cu and\nAu+Au collisions at RHIC energies and above. We discuss shear and bulk viscous\neffects on the hydrodynamic evolution of entropy density, temperature,\ncollective flow, and flow anisotropies, and on the hadron multiplicity, single\nparticle spectra and elliptic flow. Viscous entropy production and its\ninfluence on the centrality dependence of hadron multiplicities and the\nmultiplicity scaling of eccentricity-scaled elliptic flow are studied in\nviscous hydrodynamics and compared with experimental data. The dynamical\neffects of using different versions of the Israel-Stewart second order\nformalism for causal viscous fluid dynamics are discussed, resolving some of\nthe apparent discrepancies between early results reported by different groups.\nFinally, we assess the present status of constraining the shear viscosity to\nentropy ratio of the hot and dense matter created at RHIC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2009 19:41:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-26"}

The ratio of direct-photon to pion production can be about\n20-10 (at \\eta=7-8). Therefore, direct photon production at forward rapidities\nshould provide a rather clean probe. We calculate the rapidity dependence of\nthe invariant cross-section and find some peculiar enhancement at forward\nrapidities which is more pronounced for direct photon production. We show that\nthis peak is further enhanced by saturation effects. We provide predictions for\nthe nuclear modification factor R_{pA} for pions and direct photon production\nin pA collisions at LHC energy at midrapidity. We show within various\nsaturation models that the pion Cronin enhancement at RHIC is replaced by a\nmoderate suppression at LHC energy at midrapidity due to gluon shadowing\neffects. Cronin enhancement of direct photons can survive at LHC energy within\nmodels with a larger saturation scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2009 22:36:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2010 20:46:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-23"}

This extension provides an interesting attempt to answer the question\nof family replication in the sense that models for the electroweak interaction\ncan be constructed so that anomaly cancellation is achieved by an interplay\nbetween generations, all of them under the condition that the number of\nfamilies must be divisible by the number of colours of SU(3)_c. This method of\nanomaly cancellation requires a family of quarks transforming differently from\nthe other two, thus leading to tree-level flavour changing neutral currents\n(FCNC) transmitted by the two extra neutral gauge bosons $Z'$ and $Z''$\npredicted by the model. In a version of the 3-4-1 extension, which does not\ncontain particles with exotic electric charges, we study the fermion mass\nspectrum and some aspects of the phenomenology of the neutral gauge boson\nsector. In particular, we impose limits on the $Z-Z'$ mixing angle and on the\nmass scale of the corresponding physical new neutral gauge boson $Z_2$, and\nestablish a lower bound on the mass of the additional new neutral gauge boson\n$Z'' \\equiv Z_3$. For the analysis we use updated precision electroweak data at\nthe Z-pole from the CERN LEP and SLAC Linear Collider, and atomic parity\nviolation data. The mass scale of the additional new neutral gauge boson $Z_3$\nis constrained by using updated experimental inputs from neutral meson mixing\nin the analysis of the sources of FCNC in the model. The data constrain the\n$Z-Z'$ mixing angle to a very small value of O(0.001), and the lower bounds on\n$M_{Z_2}$ and on $M_{Z_3}$ are found to be of O(1 TeV) and of O(7 TeV),\nrepectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2009 22:30:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

We\nconsider the situation of converging, supersonic flows of warm neutral medium\nin the interstellar medium that generate a shocked slab of thermally unstable\ngas in which clouds form. We found, as speculated in paper I, that in the\nshocked slab magnetic pressure dominates thermal pressure and the thermal\ninstability grows in the isochorically cooling, thermally unstable slab that\nleads formation of HI clouds whose number density is typically n < 100 cm^-3,\neven if the angle between magnetic field and converging flows is small. We also\nfound that even if there is a large dispersion of magnetic field, evolution of\nthe shocked slab is essentially determined by the angle between the mean\nmagnetic field and converging flows. Thus, the direct formation of molecular\nclouds by piling up warm neutral medium does not seem a typical molecular cloud\nformation process, unless the direction of supersonic converging flows is\nbiased to the orientation of mean magnetic field by some mechanism. However,\nwhen the angle is small, the HI shell generated as a result of converging flows\nis massive and possibly evolves into molecular clouds, provided gas in the\nmassive HI shell is piled up again along the magnetic field line. We expect\nthat another subsequent shock wave can pile up again the gas of the massive\nshell and produce a larger cloud. We thus emphasize the importance of multiple\nepisodes of converging flows, as a typical formation process of molecular\nclouds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2009 23:04:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Overlapping clusters are useful in many sensor\nnetwork applications, including inter-cluster routing, node localization, and\ntime synchronization protocols.

KOCA aims at generating connected overlapping clusters that cover the\nentire sensor network with a specific average overlapping degree. Through\nanalysis and simulation experiments we show how to select the different values\nof the parameters to achieve the clustering process objectives. Moreover, the\nresults show that KOCA produces approximately equal-sized clusters, which\nallows distributing the load evenly over different clusters. In addition, KOCA\nis scalable; the clustering formation terminates in a constant time regardless\nof the network size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2009 01:43:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-09"}

Here we\nexplore the dynamics of the Brownian particle coupled to a supraohmic\nenvironment by considering the motion of a charged particle interacting with\nthe electromagnetic fluctuations at finite temperature. We also derive\nparticle's equation of motion, the Langevin equation, by minimizing the\ncorresponding stochastic effective action, which is obtained with the method of\nFeynman-Vernon influence functional. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem is\nestablished from first principles. The backreaction on the charge is known in\nterms of electromagnetic self-force given by a third-order time derivative of\nthe position, leading to the supraohmic dynamics. This self-force can be argued\nto be insignificant throughout the evolution when the charge barely moves. The\nstochastic force arising from the supraohmic environment is found to have both\npositive and negative correlations, and it drives the charge into a fluctuating\nmotion. Although positive force correlations give rise to the growth of the\nvelocity dispersion initially, its growth slows down when correlation turns\nnegative, and finally halts, thus leading to the saturation of the velocity\ndispersion. The saturation mechanism in a suparohmic environment is found to be\ndistinctly different from that in an ohmic environment.

Specifically, transitions to the fully occupied\n$1s_{1/2}$-shell yielded a limit of $4.2\\times10^{24}$ y for the process with\nthe emission of a $\\gamma$-quantum. Similarly limits of $3.1\\times10^{24}$ y\nfor $\\beta^-$ and $2.6\\times10^{24}$ y for $\\beta^+$ Pauli-forbidded transition\nof $^{12}$C $\\to$ $^{12}\\tilde{\\mathrm N}$($^{12}\\tilde{\\mathrm B}$) are\nreported. In the third work it was assumed that PEP is violated for neutrinos,\nand thus, neutrinos obey at least partly the Bose-Einstein statistics.\nConsequences of the violation of the exclusion principle for double beta decays\nwere considered. This violation strongly changes the rates of the decays and\nmodifies the energy and angular distributions of the emitted electrons. It was\nshown that pure bosonic neutrinos are excluded by the present experimental\ndata. In the case of partly bosonic neutrinos the analysis of the existing data\nallows one to put an upper bound for $sin^2\\chi < 0.6$. The sensitivity of\nfuture measurements is also evaluated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2009 11:35:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

The\nuncertainty affecting the photometric calibration of the survey dominates the\nsystematic uncertainty of the key measurement of the survey, namely the dark\nenergy equation of state. The photometric calibration of the SNLS requires\nobtaining a uniform response across the imager, calibrating the science field\nstars in each survey band (SDSS-like ugriz bands) with respect to standards\nwith known flux in the same bands, and binding the calibration to the UBVRI\nLandolt standards used to calibrate the nearby SNe from the literature\nnecessary to produce cosmological constraints.

The second component is pre-existing outer, more slowly expanding\ncircumbinary gas that represents ejecta from the secondary star or accretion\ndisk. We present measurements of the emission-line widths that show them to be\nsignificantly narrower than the broad P Cygni profiles that immediately precede\nthem. The emission profiles of novae in the nebular phase are distinctly\nrectangular, i.e., strongly suggestive of emission from a relatively thin,\nroughly spherical shell. We thus interpret novae spectral evolution in terms of\nthe collision between the two components of ejecta, which converts the early\nabsorption spectrum to an emission-line spectrum within weeks of the outburst.\nThe narrow emission widths require the outer circumbinary gas to be much more\nmassive than the white dwarf ejecta, thereby slowing the latter's expansion\nupon collision. The presence of a large reservoir of circumbinary gas at the\ntime of outburst is suggestive that novae outbursts may sometime be triggered\nby collapse of gas onto the white dwarf, as occurs for dwarf novae, rather than\nsteady mass transfer through the inner Lagrangian point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2009 13:07:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2010 04:23:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

It ends at a boundary whose location depends on resolution. This raises\nthe possibility that perturbations in the trumpet geometry could propagate down\nthe trumpet throat, reflect from the puncture boundary, and return to the black\nhole exterior with a resolution--dependent time delay. Such pathological\nbehavior is not observed. This is explained by the observation that some\nperturbative modes propagate in the conformal geometry, others propagate in the\nphysical geometry. The puncture boundary exists only in the physical geometry.\nThe modes that propagate in the physical geometry are always directed away from\nthe computational domain at the puncture boundary. The finite difference\nstencils ensure that these modes are advected through the boundary with no\ncoupling to the modes that propagate in the conformal geometry. These results\nare supported by numerical experiments with a code that evolves spherically\nsymmetric gravitational fields with standard Cartesian finite difference\nstencils. The code uses the Baumgarte--Shapiro--Shibata--Nakamura formulation\nof Einstein's equations with 1+log slicing and gamma--driver shift conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2009 13:17:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Oct 2009 14:29:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-05"}

It is assumed that all the relay nodes\nare equipped with finite impulse response (FIR) filters and use a\nfilter-and-forward (FF) strategy to compensate for the transmitter-to-relay and\nrelay-to-destination channels.\n  Three relevant half-duplex distributed beamforming problems are considered.\nThe first problem amounts to minimizing the total relay transmitted power\nsubject to the destination quality-of-service (QoS) constraint. In the second\nand third problems, the destination QoS is maximized subject to the total and\nindividual relay transmitted power constraints, respectively. For the first and\nsecond problems, closed-form solutions are obtained, whereas the third problem\nis solved using convex optimization. The latter convex optimization technique\ncan be also directly extended to the case when the individual and total power\nconstraints should be jointly taken into account. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that in the frequency selective fading case, the proposed FF\napproach provides substantial performance improvements as compared to the\ncommonly used amplify-and-forward (AF) relay beamforming strategy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2009 13:53:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

The essential step is the construction of\nan antilinear operator that we call {\\em comb} in reference to the {\\em\nhairy-ball theorem}. An appealing feature of this approach is that for qubits\n(or spins 1/2) the combs are automatically invariant under $SL(2,\\CC)$, which\nimplies that the obtained invariants are entanglement monotones by\nconstruction. By asking which property of a state determines whether or not it\nis detected by a polynomial $SL(2,\\CC)$ invariant we find that it is the\npresence of a {\\em balanced part} that persists under local unitary\ntransformations. We present a detailed analysis for the maximally entangled\nstates detected by such polynomial invariants, which leads to the concept of\n{\\em irreducibly balanced} states. The latter indicates a tight connection with\nSLOCC classifications of qubit entanglement. \\\\ Combs may also help to define\nmeasures for multipartite entanglement of higher-dimensional subsystems.\nHowever, for higher spins there are many independent combs such that it is\nnon-trivial to find an invariant one. By restricting the allowed local\noperations to rotations of the coordinate system (i.e. again to the\n$SL(2,\\CC)$) we manage to define a unique extension of the concurrence to\ngeneral half-integer spin with an analytic convex-roof expression for mixed\nstates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2009 13:37:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Apr 2010 16:23:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-12"}

An X-ray counterpart to J1819-1458 is known, and its\nproperties are similar to those of other middle-aged (0.1 Myr) neutron stars.\nWe have searched for X-ray emission with Chandra/ACIS at the positions of two\nRRATs with arcsecond (or better) localisation, J0847-4316 and J1846-0257.\nDespite deep searches (especially for J1847-0257) we did not detect any\nemission with 0.3-8 keV count-rate limits of 1 counts/ks and 0.068 counts/ks,\nrespectively, at 3sigma confidence. Assuming thermal emission similar to that\nseen from J1819-1458 (a blackbody with radius of approximately 20 km), we\nderive effective temperature limits of 77 eV and 91 eV for the nominal values\nof the distances and column densities to both sources, although both of those\nquantities are highly uncertain and correlated. If we instead fix the\ntemperature of the emission (a blackbody with kT=0.14 keV), we derive\nunabsorbed luminosity limits in the 0.3-8 keV range of 1e32 erg/s and 3e32\nerg/s. These limits are considerably below the luminosity of J1819-1458 (4e33\nerg/s), suggesting that RRATs J0847-4316 and J1846-0257 have cooled beyond the\npoint of visibility (plausible given the differences in characteristic age).\nHowever, as we have not detected X-ray emission, it may also be that the\nemission from RRATs J0847-4316 and J1846-0257 has a different character from\nthat of J1819-1458.

The\npiezoresistance is studied separately by exposing the films to the chemically\ninert gases such as nitrogen and argon. We observe that the character of the\npiezoresistive response is a function not only of the film thickness, but also\nof the pressure.

Nevertheless the approach is valid in a much\nlarger framework than $k\\cdot p$ theory, it is applicable to arbitrary systems\nof coupled partial differential equations (e.g. strain equations or Maxwell\nequations). For spinless problems (scalar equations), one can use a systematic\nSpatial Domain Reduction (SDR) technique which allows, for every irreducible\nrepresentation, to reduce the set of equations on a minimal domain with\nautomatic incorporation of the boundary conditions at the border, which are\nshown to be non-trivial in general. For a vectorial or spinorial set of\nfunctions, the SDR technique must be completed by the use of an optimal basis\nin vectorial or spinorial space (in a crystal we call it the Optimal Bloch\nfunction Basis - OBB). The advantages are numerous: sharper insights on the\nsymmetry properties of every eigenstate, minimal coupling schemes, analytically\nand computationally exploitable at the component function level, minimal\ncomputing domains. The formalism can be applied also as a postprocessing\noperation, offering all subsequent analytical and computationnal advantages of\nsymmetrization.

We have carried out a large\nscale study of this component in the nearby Virgo cluster. The diffuse light is\ntraced using planetary nebulae (PNe). The PNe are detected in the on-band image\ndue to their strong emission in the [OIII] 5007 line, but disappear in the\noff-band image. The contribution of Ly-alpha emitters at z=3.14 are corrected\nstatistically using blank field surveys.

Those fields located at smaller radii than 80 arcmin from the\ncluster center contain most of the detected diffuse light. In this central\nregion of the cluster, the ICL has a surface brightness in the range 28.8 - 30\nmag per sqarsec in the B band, it is not uniformly distributed, and represents\nabout 7% of the total galaxy light in this area. At distances larger than 80\narcmin the ICL is confined to single fields and individual sub-structures, e.g.\nin the Virgo sub-clump B, the M60/M59 group. For several fields at 2 and 3\ndegrees from the Virgo cluster center we set only upper limits. These results\nindicate that the ICL is not homogeneously distributed in the Virgo core, and\nit is concentrated in the high density regions of the Virgo cluster, e.g. the\ncluster core and other sub-structures. Outside these regions, the ICL is\nconfined within areas of 100 kpc in size, where tidal effects may be at work.\nThese observational results link the formation of the ICL with the formation\nhistory of the most luminous cluster galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2009 15:09:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

This requires new instrumentation\nwith the greatest achievable sensitivity, dynamic range, and field of view.\nReceiver noise is quickly approaching fundamental limits at most radio\nwavelengths, so significant gains in sensitivity can only be made by increasing\ncollecting area. Jointly, these requirements suggest using large arrays of\nsmaller antennas, or many moderate-size antennas equipped with multi-beam\narrays. The challenge is to develop receivers and wide bandwidth data transport\nsystems which are lower cost, more compact, more reliable, lower weight, and\nmore reproducible than the best current systems, with no compromise to\nperformance. This can be achieved with a greater degree of component\nintegration, extensive use of digital signal processing and transport, and\nreplacement of functions currently performed in bulky waveguide and coaxial\ncable components with digital arithmetic and thin optical fibers. In this white\npaper, we outline the complete redesign and re-optimization of receiver\narchitecture to take advantage of the latest advancements in commercial\ntechnology.

They are thought to be the birthplace of massive stars,\nyet remarkably little information exists on the properties of the population as\na whole (e.g. mass spectrum, spatial distribution). Genetic forward modelling\nis used along with the Two Micron All Sky Survey and the Besancon Galactic\nmodel to deduce the three dimensional distribution of interstellar extinction\ntowards previously identified IRDC candidates. This derived dust distribution\ncan then be used to determine the distance and mass of IRDCs, independently of\nkinematic models of the Milky Way. Along a line of sight that crosses an IRDC,\nthe extinction is seen to rise sharply at the distance of the cloud. Assuming a\ndust to gas ratio, the total mass of the cloud can be estimated. The method has\nbeen successfully applied to 1259 IRDCs, including over 1000 for which no\ndistance or mass estimate currently exists. The IRDCs are seen to lie\npreferentially along the spiral arms and in the molecular ring of the Milky\nWay, reinforcing the idea that they are the birthplace of massive stars. Also,\ntheir mass spectrum is seen to follow a power law with an index of -1.75 +/-\n0.06, steeper than giant molecular clouds in the inner Galaxy, but comparable\nto clumps in GMCs. This slope suggests that the IRDCs detected using the\npresent method are not gravitationally bound, but are rather the result of\ndensity fluctuations induced by turbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2009 15:26:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}
