In particular, we show that if one records an\nanisotropy signal produced by heavy nuclei of charge Z above an energy E_{thr},\none should record an even stronger (possibly much stronger) anisotropy at\nenergies >E_{thr}/Z due to the proton component that is expected to be\nassociated with the sources of the heavy nuclei. This conclusion remains robust\nwith respect to the parameters characterizing the sources and it does not\ndepend at all on the modelling of astrophysical magnetic fields. As a concrete\nexample, we apply this test to the most recent data of the Pierre Auger\nObservatory. Assuming that the anisotropy reported above 55EeV is not a\nstatistical accident, and that no significant anisotropy has been observed at\nenergies <10EeV, we show that the apparent clustering toward Cen A cannot be\nattributed to heavy nuclei. Similar conclusions are drawn regarding the\napparent excess correlation with nearby active galactic nuclei. We then discuss\na robust lower bound to the magnetic luminosity that a source must possess in\norder to be able to accelerate particles of charge Z up to 100EeV,\nL_B>10^{45}Z^{-2}erg/s. Using this bound in conjunction with the above\nconclusions, we argue that the current PAO data does not support the model of\ncosmic ray origin in active radio-quiet or even radio-loud galaxies. Finally,\nwe demonstrate that the apparent clustering in the direction of Cen A can be\nexplained by the contribution of the last few gamma-ray bursts or magnetars in\nthe host galaxy thanks to the scattering of the cosmic rays on the magnetized\nlobes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2009 18:06:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The second is that at a given redshift, the fraction of\nhost-galaxy light in the fiber increases with decreasing galaxy luminosity. We\nillustrate the latter effect using the Kormendy et al.

With allowance for the two effects, we obtain a black hole\nmass - bulge luminosity relationship for AGNs which has a scatter of only +/-\n0.23 dex in mass.

We locate the source of the water\nmaser outflow at the position of the compact mid-IR peak of source G (source\nG:IRS1). This IR source is not coincident with any identified compact radio\ncontinuum source, but is coincident with a hot molecular core, so we propose\nthat G:IRS1 is a hot core driving an outflow analogous to the wide-angle\nbipolar outflow in OMC-1. G:IRS1 is at the origin of a larger bipolar cavity\nand CO outflow. The water maser outflow is orthogonal to the bipolar CO cavity,\nso the masers probably reside near its waist in the cavity walls. Models of the\nIR emission require a massive protostar of 45Msun, 3e5Lsun, and an effective\nenvelope accretion rate of 1e-3Msun/yr. Feedback from the central star could\npotentially drive the H2O maser outflow, but it has insufficient radiative\nmomentum to have driven the large-scale CO outflow, requiring that this massive\nstar had an active accretion disk over the past 10^4 yr.

For\nwireless networks (and other networks), graphs are actually not the correct\nmodel of the communication; instead hyper-graphs better capture the\ncommunication over a wireless shared channel. Motivated by this example, we\nstudy in this paper random walks on hyper-graphs. First, we formalize the\nrandom walk process on hyper-graphs and generalize key notions from random\nwalks on graphs. We then give the novel definition of radio cover time, namely,\nthe expected time of a random walk to be heard (as opposed to visit) by all\nnodes. We then provide some basic bounds on the radio cover, in particular, we\nshow that while on graphs the radio cover time is O(mn), in hyper-graphs it is\nO(mnr) where n, m and r are the number of nodes, the number of edges and the\nrank of the hyper-graph, respectively. In addition, we define radio hitting\ntimes and give a polynomial algorithm to compute them. We conclude the paper\nwith results on specific hyper-graphs that model wireless networks in one and\ntwo dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2009 21:32:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-13"}

Second, we calculate them directly from\nthe bulk, taking into account the Gibbons-Hawking-York terms in the bulk\nEinstein-Hilbert action. As an application, we use the new boundary terms to\nderive Israel junction conditions for Pi across a sheet-like source. In\naddition, we calculate boundary terms and junction conditions for the galileons\nwhich generalize the DGP Pi-lagrangian, showing that the boundary term for the\nn-th order galileon is the (n-1)-th order galileon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2009 22:31:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2009 21:34:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-18"}

In this paper, according to the known\nconnections between MFPT, effective resistance, and the eigenvalues of graph\nLaplacian, we first study analytically the MFPT between all node pairs of a\nclass of growing treelike networks, which we term deterministic uniform\nrecursive trees (DURTs), since one of its particular cases is a deterministic\nversion of the famous uniform recursive tree. The interesting quantity is\ndetermined exactly through the recursive relation of the Laplacian spectra\nobtained from the special construction of DURTs. The analytical result shows\nthat the MFPT between all couples of nodes in DURTs varies as $N \\ln N$ for\nlarge networks with node number $N$. Second, we study trapping on a particular\nnetwork of DURTs, focusing on a special case with the immobile trap positioned\nat a node having largest degree. We determine exactly the average trapping time\n(ATT) that is defined as the average of FPT from all nodes to the trap. In\ncontrast to the scaling of the MFPT, the leading behavior of ATT is a linear\nfunction of $N$. Interestingly, we show that the behavior for ATT of the\ntrapping problem is related to the trapping location, which is in comparison\nwith the phenomenon of trapping on fractal T-graph although both networks\nexhibit treestructure. Finally, we believe that the methods could open the way\nto exactly calculate the MFPT and ATT in a wide range of deterministic media.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2009 00:14:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 30 Jan 2010 03:51:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-30"}

This work strongly supports the\nfundamental timelessness of Nature. However, the correct view that physics is\ndescribed by relations between variables does not address the second problem of\nhow time does emerge at the macroscopic scale on the ground of a timeless\nframework. In this work ordinary Hamiltonian dynamics is recast in a timeless\nformalism capable to provide a definition of parameter time on the basis of the\nonly generalized coordinates, together with the Hamiltonian invariance on\ntrajectories, and a variational principle. Next, by relaxing the assumption of\nperiodicity of real clocks to the only cyclicity in the phase space, the second\nproblem is addressed. Physical systems, if complex enough, can be separated in\na subsystem whose dynamics is described, and another cyclic subsystem which\nbehaves as a clock. The dynamics of the first is mapped in the states of the\nsecond cyclic subsystem which provides a discrete approximation of the\nparameter time. Useful clocks fulfill a stability prescription which guarantees\nthat dynamics is expressed by simple laws also in terms of metric time as\nnaturally happens for parameter time. The two ideas provide a unitary framework\ncapable to account the fundamental timelessness of Nature, and the experimental\nevidence of time evolution in macroscopic systems experienced by the observers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2009 01:37:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-05"}

Node cooperation\nand opportunistic scheduling scheme are two important techniques to improve the\nperformance in wireless scenarios. In the paper we consider such a problem how\nto efficiently combine opportunistic scheduling and cooperative modes in the\nRayleigh fading scenarios. To do so, we first compare the throughput of SRP\n(Spatial Reused Pattern) and AFP (Amplify Forwarding Pattern) in the\nhalf-duplex case with the assumption that channel side information is known to\nall and then come up with a new scheduling scheme. It will that that only\nswitching between SRP and AFP simply does little help to obtain an expected\nimprovement because SRP is always superior to AFP on average due to its\nefficient spatial reuse. To improve the throughput further, we put forward a\nnew processing strategy in which buffers are employed at both relays in SRP\nmode. By efficiently utilizing the links with relatively higher gains, the\nthroughput can be greatly improved at a cost of queuing delay. Furthermore, we\nshall quantitatively evaluate the queuing delay and the tradeoff between the\nthroughput and the additional queuing delay. Finally, to realize our developed\nstrategy and make sure it always run at stable status, we present two criteria\nand an algorithm on the selection and adjustment of the switching thresholds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2009 06:29:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-13"}

The emission could\noriginate from either truly diffuse processes or from unresolved point sources.\nAlthough the majority of the 271 point sources detected by EGRET (Energetic\nGamma Ray Experiment Telescope) are unidentified, of the identified sources,\nblazars are the dominant candidates. Therefore, unresolved blazars may be\nconsidered the main contributor to the EGRB, and many studies have been carried\nout to understand their distribution, evolution and contribution to the EGRB.\nConsidering that gamma-ray emission comes mostly from jets of blazars and that\nthe jet emission decreases rapidly with increasing jet to line-of-sight angle,\nit is not surprising that EGRET was not able to detect many large inclination\nangle active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Though Fermi could only detect a few large\ninclination angle AGNs in the first three months' survey, it is expected to\ndetect many such sources in the near future. Since non-blazar AGNs are expected\nto have higher density as compared to blazars, these could also contribute\nsignificantly to the EGRB.

Suppose that a number of institutes are hiring\nfaculty members from a pool of applicants. Both institutes and applicants have\npreferences over the other side. An institute classifies the applicants based\non their research areas (or any other criterion), and, for each class, it sets\na lower bound and an upper bound on the number of applicants it would hire in\nthat class. The objective is to find a stable matching from which no group of\nparticipants has reason to deviate. Moreover, the matching should respect the\nupper/lower bounds of the classes.\n  In the first part of the paper, we study classified stable matching problems\nwhose classifications belong to a fixed set of ``order types.'' We show that if\nthe set consists entirely of downward forests, there is a polynomial-time\nalgorithm; otherwise, it is NP-complete to decide the existence of a stable\nmatching.\n  In the second part, we investigate the problem using a polyhedral approach.\nSuppose that all classifications are laminar families and there is no lower\nbound. We propose a set of linear inequalities to describe stable matching\npolytope and prove that it is integral. This integrality allows us to find\nvarious optimal stable matchings using Ellipsoid algorithm. A further\nramification of our result is the description of the stable matching polytope\nfor the many-to-many (unclassified) stable matching problem.

A physical system, that is in an entangled state\ndisplays an intricate correlation between its subsystems. There are also some\ncomposite quantum states (classically correlated states or separable states)\nthat are not entangled. It is generally claimed, often without a rigorous proof\nto support, that these intricate correlations of an entangled state cannot\noccur in a classical system. This expository article, provides an elementary\nproof that entangled states cannot arise in the setting of classical mechanics.\nIn addition, a detailed description of the origin of entanglement in quantum\nsystems is included. The mathematical concepts that are necessary for this\npurpose are presented. The absence of entanglement in the classical setting is\ndue to the fact that every pure classical state of a composite system is a\nproduct state, that is, a tensor product of two pure states of the subsystems.\nIn contrast, there are pure composite quantum states that cannot be expressed\nin the form of a product state or even by a convex sum of product states.\nRoughly speaking, this is because classical states are positive valued\nfunctions on the phase-space while quantum states are positive linear\noperators. The structure of the tensor product between two commutative spaces\nof scalar valued functions is drastically different from that of the tensor\nproduct between two non-commutative spaces of linear operators. In other words,\nentanglement is a non-commutative phenomenon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2009 11:33:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-13"}

The effect is due\nto the long-range nature of the Coulomb interaction. A tiny surface\nconcentration of defects about a fraction of one per cent is sufficient to\nexplain the line broadening observed in Sr$_2$CuO$_2$Cl$_2$, La$_2$CuO$_{4}$,\nand Ca$_{2}$CuO$_{2}$Cl$_{2}$.

Most of the existing papers devoted to minimax properties assume that the\nsupport of the underlying density is bounded and known. But this assumption may\nbe very difficult to handle in practice. In this work, we show that, exactly as\na curse of dimensionality exists when the data lie in $\\R^d$, there exists a\ncurse of support as well when the support of the density is infinite. As for\nthe dimensionality problem where the rates of convergence deteriorate when the\ndimension grows, the minimax rates of convergence may deteriorate as well when\nthe support becomes infinite. This problem is not purely theoretical since the\nsimulations show that the support-dependent methods are really affected in\npractice by the size of the density support, or by the weight of the density\ntail. We propose a method based on a biorthogonal wavelet thresholding rule\nthat is adaptive with respect to the nature of the support and the regularity\nof the signal, but that is also robust in practice to this curse of support.\nThe threshold, that is proposed here, is very accurately calibrated so that the\ngap between optimal theoretical and practical tuning parameters is almost\nfilled.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2009 12:25:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-13"}

In this paper, we argue that Phi is proportional to the\nelectronegativity (Chi) of metallic elements and that N^(1/3) is the valence\neffective on a linear bond. We show that, with the above hypothesis, Chi can be\nderived in the absolute sense, following Gordy, as the electrostatic potential\ndue to the effective charge of the nucleus of an atom in a metal, felt at the\nmid-point of a bond to the nearest atom. The exponent 1/3 has its origin in the\nhigh ligancy and resonance in metals. An excellent agreement with the\nhypothesis is observed for the hypoelectronic elements, while the buffer and\nhyperelectronic elements show interesting variations. It is argued that the\nunlike atom pair bond energies, which are correlated to the distribution of\nbinary systems on the map constructed using the magnitudes of parameters del\nPhi and del N of Miedema, originate from the scatter in the distribution of\nelements in the electronegativity versus N^(1/3)/R graph.

Only based on\nthe raw data of the jet components (right ascension and declination offsets\nfrom the core), the cross-entropy method searches for the precession model\nparameters that better represent the data. In this work we present a large\nnumber of tests to validate this technique, using synthetic precessing jets\nbuilt from a given set of precession parameters. Aiming to recover these\nparameters, we applied the cross-entropy method to our precession model,\nvarying exhaustively the quantities associated to the method. Our results have\nshown that even in the most challenging tests, the cross-entropy method was\nable to find the correct parameters within 1%-level. Even for a non-precessing\njet, our optimization method could point out successfully the lack of\nprecession.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2009 13:23:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

For quantum wires with\nspin-conserving boundary conditions, we find a crossover from weak anti- to\nweak localization as the wire width W is reduced using exact diagonalization of\nthe Cooperon equation. This crossover is due to the dimensional dependence of\nthe spin relaxation rate of conduction electrons, which becomes diminished,\nwhen the wire width is smaller than the bulk spin precession length $L_{SO}$.\nWe thus confirm previous results for small wire width, $W/L_{SO}<= 1$\n[PRL98,176808(2007)], where only the transverse 0-modes of the Cooperon\nequation had been taken into account. We find that spin helix solutions become\nstable for arbitrary ratios of linear Rashba and Dresselhaus coupling in narrow\nwires. For wider wires, the spin relaxation rate is found to be not monotonous\nas function of wire width: it becomes first enhanced for W on the order of the\nbulk $L_{SO}$ before it becomes diminished for smaller wire widths. In\naddition, we find that the spin relaxation is smallest at the edge of the wire\nfor wide wires. The effect of the Zeeman coupling to the magnetic field\nperpendicular to the 2D electron system is studied and found that it shifts the\ncrossover from weak anti- to weak localization to larger wire widths $W_c$.\nWhen the transverse confinement potential of the quantum wire is smooth\n(adiabatic), the spin relaxation rate is found to be enhanced as W is reduced.\nWe find that only a spin polarized state retains a finite spin relaxation rate\nin such narrow wires. Thus, we conclude that the injection of polarized spins\ninto nonmagnetic quantum wires should be favorable in wires with smooth\nconfinement potential. Finally, in wires with tubular shape, corresponding to\ntransverse periodic boundary conditions, we find no reduction of the spin\nrelaxation rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2009 13:32:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2010 10:52:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-25"}

The consideration of\narbitrary coordinate systems for the representation of both, the points in the\nlaboratory, and the material points (comoving coordinates), allows to develop a\nsimple, old fashioned theory, where only measurable quantities -like the Cauchy\nstress- need be introduced. The theory accounts for the possibility of\nasymmetric stress (Cosserat elastic media), but, contrary to usual developments\nof the theory, the basic variable is not a micro-rotation, but the more\nfundamental micro-rotation velocity. The deformation tensor here introduced is\nthe proper tensorial equivalent of the poorly defined deformation \"tensors\" of\nthe usual theory. It is related to the deformation velocity tensor via the\nmatricant. The strain is the logarithm of the deformation tensor.

Mid-infrared observations have revealed the nature of some of the\nmolecules in the MOLsphere, some being the precursor of dust. Aims: Betelgeuse\nis an excellent candidate to understand the process of mass loss in red\nsupergiants. Using diffraction-limited adaptive optics (AO) in the\nnear-infrared, we probe the photosphere and close environment of Betelgeuse to\nstudy the wavelength dependence of its extension, and to search for\nasymmetries. Methods: We obtained AO images with the VLT/NACO instrument,\ntaking advantage of the \"cube\" mode of the CONICA camera to record separately a\nlarge number of short-exposure frames. This allowed us to adopt a \"lucky\nimaging\" approach for the data reduction, and obtain diffraction-limited images\nover the spectral range 1.04-2.17 $\\mu$m in 10 narrow-band filters. Results: In\nall filters, the photosphere of Betelgeuse appears partly resolved. We identify\nan asymmetric envelope around the star, with in particular a relatively bright\n\"plume\" extending in the southwestern quadrant up to a radius of approximately\nsix times the photosphere. The CN molecule provides an excellent match to the\n1.09 mic bandhead in absorption in front of the stellar photosphere, but the\nemission spectrum of the plume is more difficult to interpret. Conclusions: Our\nAO images show that the envelope surrounding Betelgeuse has a complex and\nirregular structure. We propose that the southwestern plume is linked either to\nthe presence of a convective hot spot on the photosphere, or to the rotation of\nthe star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2009 15:20:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

This versatility arises\nfrom its almost unique ability to remodel under applied loads into anisotropic\nand inhomogeneous structures. To explore the origins of this property, we\ndevelop a set of analysis tools and a novel experimental setup that probes the\nmechanical response of fibrous networks in a geometry that mimics a typical\ndeformation profile imposed by cells in vivo. We observe strong fiber alignment\nand densification as a function of applied strain for both uncrosslinked and\ncrosslinked collagenous networks. This alignment is found to be irreversibly\nimprinted in uncrosslinked collagen networks, suggesting a simple mechanism for\ntissue organization at the microscale. However, crosslinked networks display\nsimilar fiber alignment and the same geometrical properties as uncrosslinked\ngels, but with full reversibility. Plasticity is therefore not required to\nalign fibers. On the contrary, our data show that this effect is part of the\nfundamental non-linear properties of fibrous biological networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2009 15:56:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-13"}

The latter can be achieved by subjecting the system to changes in\nthe length scale at intermittent times.

Many growing tissues (leaves, flowers or marine invertebrates)\nattain complicated configurations during their free growth. Our study departs\nfrom the 3d incompatible elasticity theory, conjectured to explain the\nmechanism for the spontaneous formation of non-Euclidean metrics.\n  Recall that a smooth Riemannian metric on a simply connected domain can be\nrealized as the pull-back metric of an orientation preserving deformation if\nand only if the associated Riemann curvature tensor vanishes identically. When\nthis condition fails, one seeks a deformation yielding the closest metric\nrealization. We set up a variational formulation of this problem by introducing\nthe non-Euclidean version of the nonlinear elasticity functional, and establish\nits $\\Gamma$-convergence under the proper scaling. As a corollary, we obtain\nnew necessary and sufficient conditions for existence of a $W^{2,2}$ isometric\nimmersion of a given 2d metric into $\\mathbb R^3$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2009 15:59:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-13"}
