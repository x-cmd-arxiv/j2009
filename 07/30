In June 2004, we targeted the cluster during a\n10 day multi-site campaign, which involved the MPG/ESO 2.2m telescope with its\nwide-field imager and the Anglo-Australian 3.9m telescope, equipped with the\nIRIS2 near-infrared imager.

We have refined the cluster's fundamental parameters, deriving\n(V_0-M_v)=11.15, E(B - V)=0.15, E(V - I)=0.25, E(V - J)=0.50, and E(V -\nH)=0.55.

It is therefore useful to consider the mutual information that\nthese data sets contain. In this paper we present a cross-correlation study\nbetween the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (kSZ) -- produced by the\nscattering of CMB photons off free electrons produced during the reionization\nprocess -- and the cosmological 21cm signal -- which reflects the neutral\nhydrogen content of the Universe, as a function of redshift. The study is\ncarried out using a simulated reionization history in 100Mpc/h scale N-body\nsimulations with radiative transfer. In essence we find that the two probes\nanti-correlate. The significance of the anti-correlation signal depends on the\nextent of the reionization process, wherein extended histories result in a much\nstronger signal compared to instantaneous cases. Unfortunately however, once\nthe primary CMB fluctuations are included into our simulation they serve as a\nsource of large correlated noise that renders the cross-correlation signal\ninsignificant, regardless of the reionization scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2009 17:12:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

An analysis of the various derivations extant in the literature\nleads me to formulate an asymptotic expansion in which the metric is expanded\nwhile a representative worldline is held fixed; I discuss the utility of this\nexpansion for both exact point particles and asymptotically small bodies,\ncontrasting it with a regular expansion in which both the metric and the\nworldline are expanded. Based on these preliminary analyses, I present a\ngeneral method of deriving self-consistent equations of motion for arbitrarily\nstructured (sufficiently compact) small bodies. My method utilizes two\nexpansions: an inner expansion that keeps the size of the body fixed, and an\nouter expansion that lets the body shrink while holding its worldline fixed. By\nimposing the Lorenz gauge, I express the global solution to the Einstein\nequation in the outer expansion in terms of an integral over a worldtube of\nsmall radius surrounding the body. Appropriate boundary data on the tube are\ndetermined from a local-in-space expansion in a buffer region where both the\ninner and outer expansions are valid. This buffer-region expansion also results\nin an expression for the self-force in terms of irreducible pieces of the\nmetric perturbation on the worldline. Based on the global solution, these\npieces of the perturbation can be written in terms of a tail integral over the\nbody's past history. This approach can be applied at any order to obtain a\nself-consistent approximation that is valid on long timescales, both near and\nfar from the small body.

It is however still unclear how BHs\nhave grown, and whether they have co-evolved with their hosts. In this Review I\ndiscuss how, in ways independent of specific models, constraints on the growth\nhistory of BHs and their host galaxies have been set by matching the statistics\nof local BHs to the emissivity, number density, and clustering properties of\nAGNs at different cosmological epochs.

The low-energy electronic states of graphene have two\nnon-equivalent massless Dirac spectrum. The relative distance between these two\nDirac points in the momentum space and edge states due to the existence of the\nzigzag type graphene edges are decisive to the electronic and transport\nproperties of graphene nanoribbons. In graphene nanoribbons with zigzag edges,\ntwo valleys related to each Dirac spectrum are well separated in momentum\nspace. The propagating modes in each valley contain a single chiral mode\noriginating from a partially flat band at band center. This feature gives rise\nto a perfectly conducting channel in the disordered system, if the impurity\nscattering does not connect the two valleys, i.e. for long-range impurity\npotentials. On the other hand, the low-energy spectrum of graphene nanoribbons\nwith armchair edges is described as the superposition of two non-equivalent\nDirac points of graphene. In spite of the lack of well-separated two valley\nstructures, the single-channel transport subjected to long-ranged impurities is\nnearly perfectly conducting, where the backward scattering matrix elements in\nthe lowest order vanish as a manifestation of internal phase structures of the\nwavefunction. Symmetry considerations lead to the classification of disordered\nzigzag ribbons into the unitary class for long-range impurities, and the\northogonal class for short-range impurities. However, no such crossover occurs\nin armchair nanoribbons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2009 02:44:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-30"}

The method is much faster than direct\nnumerical integration over systematic `nuisance' parameters, and is not\nrestricted to simple, idealized cases as is analytic marginalization. It does\nnot assume the data are normally distributed, and does not require Gaussian\npriors on the specific systematic uncertainties.

The method\ncan be generalized and used to propagate any systematic uncertainties for which\na set of templates is available.

This embedding represents any probability\nmeasure as a mean element in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). A\npseudometric on the space of probability measures can be defined as the\ndistance between distribution embeddings: we denote this as $\\gamma_k$, indexed\nby the kernel function $k$ that defines the inner product in the RKHS.\n  We present three theoretical properties of $\\gamma_k$. First, we consider the\nquestion of determining the conditions on the kernel $k$ for which $\\gamma_k$\nis a metric: such $k$ are denoted {\\em characteristic kernels}. Unlike\npseudometrics, a metric is zero only when two distributions coincide, thus\nensuring the RKHS embedding maps all distributions uniquely (i.e., the\nembedding is injective). While previously published conditions may apply only\nin restricted circumstances (e.g. on compact domains), and are difficult to\ncheck, our conditions are straightforward and intuitive: bounded continuous\nstrictly positive definite kernels are characteristic. Alternatively, if a\nbounded continuous kernel is translation-invariant on $\\bb{R}^d$, then it is\ncharacteristic if and only if the support of its Fourier transform is the\nentire $\\bb{R}^d$. Second, we show that there exist distinct distributions that\nare arbitrarily close in $\\gamma_k$. Third, to understand the nature of the\ntopology induced by $\\gamma_k$, we relate $\\gamma_k$ to other popular metrics\non probability measures, and present conditions on the kernel $k$ under which\n$\\gamma_k$ metrizes the weak topology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2009 11:20:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 2009 20:31:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 30 Jan 2010 02:42:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-30"}

In the second one objective\nboundary competence level is decreased for estimation error. Similarly,\nanti-Peter principle holds two sub-principles too. All this implies that\nparadoxical situations that follow from Peter and anti-Peter principle can be\nsimply removed by decrease of the error of hierarchical (social) control. Also\nwe discuss cases by Peter principle when error of the boundary competence level\nby estimation grows up.

In\nparticular, models of social and financial cascades, as well as the fiber\nbundle model, the voter model, and models of epidemic spreading are recovered\nas special cases. To unify their description, we define the net fragility of a\nnode, which is the difference between its fragility and the threshold that\ndetermines its failure. Nodes fail if their net fragility grows above zero and\ntheir failure increases the fragility of neighbouring nodes, thus possibly\ntriggering a cascade. In this framework, we identify three classes depending on\nthe way the fragility of a node is increased by the failure of a neighbour. At\nthe microscopic level, we illustrate with specific examples how the failure\nspreading pattern varies with the node triggering the cascade, depending on its\nposition in the network and its degree. At the macroscopic level, systemic risk\nis measured as the final fraction of failed nodes, $X^\\ast$, and for each of\nthe three classes we derive a recursive equation to compute its value. The\nphase diagram of $X^\\ast$ as a function of the initial conditions, thus allows\nfor a prediction of the systemic risk as well as a comparison of the three\ndifferent model classes. We could identify which model class lead to a\nfirst-order phase transition in systemic risk, i.e. situations where small\nchanges in the initial conditions may lead to a global failure. Eventually, we\ngeneralize our framework to encompass stochastic contagion models. This\nindicates the potential for further generalizations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2009 15:45:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2010 16:46:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

These invariants can be seen as\n\"slow entropies\", they describe the polynomial growth rate of the number of\nballs (for the usual \"dynamical\" distances) of coverings of the ambient space.\nWe then define a new class of integrable systems, which we call decomposable\nsystems, for which one can prove that the weak complexity index is smaller than\nthe number of degrees of freedom. Hamiltonian systems integrable by means of\nnon-degenerate integrals (in Eliasson-Williamson sense), subjected to natural\nadditional assumptions, are the main examples of decomposable systems. We\nfinally give explicit examples of computation of the complexity index, for\nMorse Hamiltonian systems on surfaces and for two-dimensional gradient systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2009 15:31:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-31"}

Sub-micro-arc-second angular\nresolution, necessary to achieve objectives such as imaging the regions around\nthe event horizon of a super-massive black hole at the center of an active\ngalaxy, can be achieved if beams from parts of the incoming wavefront separated\nby 100s of meters can be stably and accurately brought together at small\nangles. One way of achieving this is by using grazing incidence mirrors. We\nhere investigate an alternative approach in which the beams are recombined by\noptical elements working in transmission. It is shown that the use of\ndiffractive elements is a particularly attractive option. We report\nexperimental results from a simple 2-beam interferometer using a low-cost\ncommercially available profiled film as the diffractive elements. A\nrotationally symmetric filled (or mostly filled) aperture variant of such an\ninterferometer, equivalent to an X-ray axicon, is shown to offer a much wider\nbandpass than either a Phase Fresnel Lens (PFL) or a PFL with a refractive lens\nin an achromatic pair. Simulations of an example system are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2009 15:34:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-31"}

Among the most interesting phenomena of flavor\nphysics is the violation of the CP symmetry that has been subtle and difficult\nto explore.
