However, the emphasis is on\nstarting with a constant coefficient equation as a model, which then\nuniversally determines an equation on every riemannian manifold which is\nequipped with a topological reduction of the structure group to the invariance\ngroup of the model. For example, this covers all branches of the homogeneous\ncomplex Monge-Ampere equation on an almost complex hermitian manifold X.\n  In general, for an equation F on a manifold X and a smooth domain D in X, we\ngive geometric conditions which imply that the Dirichlet problem on D is\nuniquely solvable for all continuous boundary functions. We begin by\nintroducing a weakened form of comparison which has the advantage that local\nimplies global. We then associate to F two natural \"conical subequations\": a\nmonotonicity subequation M and the asymptotic interior of F. If X carries a\nglobal M-subharmonic function, then weak comparison implies full comparison.\nThe asymptotic interior of F is used to formulate boundary convexity and\nprovide barriers.

However, the standard PCA suffers from the fact that the principal\ncomponents (PCs) are usually linear combinations of all the original variables,\nand it is thus often difficult to interpret the PCs. To alleviate this\ndrawback, various sparse PCA approaches were proposed in literature [15, 6, 17,\n28, 8, 25, 18, 7, 16]. Despite success in achieving sparsity, some important\nproperties enjoyed by the standard PCA are lost in these methods such as\nuncorrelation of PCs and orthogonality of loading vectors. Also, the total\nexplained variance that they attempt to maximize can be too optimistic. In this\npaper we propose a new formulation for sparse PCA, aiming at finding sparse and\nnearly uncorrelated PCs with orthogonal loading vectors while explaining as\nmuch of the total variance as possible. We also develop a novel augmented\nLagrangian method for solving a class of nonsmooth constrained optimization\nproblems, which is well suited for our formulation of sparse PCA. We show that\nit converges to a feasible point, and moreover under some regularity\nassumptions, it converges to a stationary point. Additionally, we propose two\nnonmonotone gradient methods for solving the augmented Lagrangian subproblems,\nand establish their global and local convergence. Finally, we compare our\nsparse PCA approach with several existing methods on synthetic, random, and\nreal data, respectively. The computational results demonstrate that the sparse\nPCs produced by our approach substantially outperform those by other methods in\nterms of total explained variance, correlation of PCs, and orthogonality of\nloading vectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2009 00:45:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-14"}

The central problem in fabricating bipedal\nnanomotors is how the motor as a whole can gain the synergic capacity of\ndirectional track-walking, given the fact that each pedal component alone often\nis incapable of any directional drift. Implemented bipedal motors to date solve\nthis thermodynamically intricate problem by an intuitive strategy that requires\na hetero-pedal motor, multiple anchorage species for the track, and multiple\nreagent species for motor operation. Here we presented a detailed molecular\nmechanism by which motor-level directionality arises from a homo-pedal motor\nalong a minimally heterogeneous track. Optimally, the operation may be reduced\nto a random supply of a single species of reagents to allow the motor's\nautonomous functioning. The mechanism suggests a distinct class of fabrication\ntargets of drastically reduced system requirements. Intriguingly, a defective\nform of the mechanism falls into the realm of the well known Brownian motor\nmechanism, yet distinct features emerge from the normal working of the\nmechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2009 02:00:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

We\ninvestigate the 5-35 um Spitzer IRS spectra of a sample of 13 group I sources\nand 20 group II sources. We focus on the continuum emission to study the\nunderlying disk geometry. We have determined the [30/13.5] and [13.5/7]\ncontinuum flux ratios. The 7-um flux excess with respect to the stellar\nphotosphere is measured, as a marker for the strength of the near-IR emission\nproduced by the inner disk. We have compared our data to self-consistent\npassive-disk model spectra, for which the same quantities were derived. We\nconfirm the literature result that the difference in continuum emission between\ngroup I and II sources can largely be explained by a different amount of small\ndust grains. However, we report a strong correlation between the [30/13.5] and\n[13.5/7] flux ratios for Meeus group II sources. Moreover, the [30/13.5] flux\nratio decreases with increasing 7-um excess for all targets in the sample. To\nexplain these correlations with the models, we need to introduce an artificial\nscaling factor for the inner disk height. In roughly 50% of the Herbig Ae/Be\nstars in our sample, the inner disk must be inflated by a factor 2 to 3 beyond\nwhat hydrostatic calculations predict. The total disk mass in small dust grains\ndetermines the degree of flaring. We conclude, however, that for any given disk\nmass in small dust grains, the shadowing of the outer (tens of AU) disk is\ndetermined by the scale height of the inner disk (1 AU). The inner disk\npartially obscures the outer disk, reducing the disk surface temperature.

We compare the dynamical behaviour of flux\ntubes in a fully convective shell possessing self-consistently generated mean\nflows such as meridional circulation and differential rotation, with reference\ncalculations done in a quiet isentropic zone.

Further, when the tube is sufficiently strong with respect\nto the equipartition field, it rises almost radially independently of the\ninitial latitude (either low or high). By contrast, weaker field cases indicate\nthat downflows and upflows control the rising velocity of particular regions of\nthe rope and could in principle favour the emergence of flux through Omega-loop\nstructures. For these latter cases, we focus on the orientation of bipolar\npatches and find that sufficiently arched structures are able to create bipolar\nregions with a predominantly East-West orientation.

In the Sun an enhancement of the elements\nwith low first ionization potential (FIP) is observed in the corona with\nrespect to the photosphere. Stars with high levels of activity seem to show a\ndepletion of elements with low FIP when compared to solar standard values;\nhowever the few cases of active stars in which photospheric values are\navailable for comparison lead to confusing results, and an enlargement of the\nsample is mandatory for solving this longstanding problem. Aims: We calculate\nin this paper the photospheric and coronal abundances of two well known active\nbinary systems, AR Psc and AY Cet, to get further insight into the\ncomplications of coronal abundances. Methods: Coronal abundances of 9 elements\nwere calculated by means of the reconstruction of a detailed emission measure\ndistribution, using a line-based method that considers the lines from different\nelements separately. Photospheric abundances of 8 elements were calculated\nusing high-resolution optical spectra of the stars. Results: The results once\nagain show a lack of any FIP-related effect in the coronal abundances of the\nstars. The presence of metal abundance depletion (MAD) or inverse FIP effects\nin some stars could stem from a mistaken comparison to solar photospheric\nvalues, or from a deficient calculation of photospheric abundances in\nfast-rotating stars. Conclusions: The lack of FIP fractionation seems to\nconfirm that Alfven waves combined with pondermotive forces are dominant in the\ncorona of active stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2009 12:44:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 2009 07:31:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-12"}

We show numerically and derive analytically that a\nclosed-shell ansatz, the usual ingredient of mean-field methods, does not\nproperly describe the step-like electron transfer characteristic in weakly\ncoupled systems. With the multideterminant results as a benchmark, we have\nevaluated the performance of common ab initio mean field techniques, such as\nHartree Fock (HF) and Density Functional Theory (DFT) with local and hybrid\nexchange correlation functionals, with a special focus on spin-polarization\neffects. For HF and hybrid DFT, a qualitatively correct open-shell solution\nwith distinct steps in the electron transfer behaviour can be obtained with a\nspin-unrestricted (i.e., spin-polarized) ansatz though this solution differs\nquantitatively from the multideterminant reference. We also discuss the\nrelationship between the electronic eigenvalue gap and the onset of charge\ntransfer for both HF and DFT and relate our findings to recently proposed\npractical schemes for calculating the addition energies in the Coulomb blockade\nregime for single molecule junctions from closed-shell DFT within the local\ndensity approximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2009 13:49:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

It can be mapped on the\nphysical model of directed polymers in random media. We consider the\nfinite-temperature version of local sequence alignment for proteins and study\nthe transition between the linear phase and the biologically relevant\nlogarithmic phase, where the free-energy grows linearly or logarithmically with\nthe sequence length. By means of numerical simulations and finite-size scaling\nanalysis we determine the phase diagram in the plane that is spanned by the gap\ncosts and the temperature. We use the most frequently used parameter set for\nprotein alignment. The critical exponents that describe the parameter driven\ntransition are found to be explicitly temperature dependent.\n  Furthermore, we study the shape of the (free-) energy distribution close to\nthe transition by rare-event simulations down to probabilities of the order\n$10^{-64}$. It is well known that, in the logarithmic region, the optimal score\ndistribution (T=0) is described by a modified Gumbel distribution. We confirm\nthat this also applies for the free-energy distribution ($T>0$). However, in\nthe linear phase, the distribution crosses over to a modified Gaussian\ndistribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2009 15:15:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}
