We examine the potential\nfor the CERN Large Hadron Collider to distinguish models with parity stabilized\ndark matter from models in which the dark matter is stabilized by other\nsymmetries. In this letter, we focus on signatures involving long-lived\nparticles and large amounts of missing transverse energy. To illustrate these\nsignatures, we consider three models from the literature which are\nrepresentative of a more general class of models with non-traditional\nstabilization symmetries. The most optimistic scenario can observe the proposed\nsignature with a minimum of 10 inverse fb of integrated luminosity at design\ncenter of mass energy. It will probably take considerable longer to validate\nthe stabilizing symmetry is not a simple parity. In all, we emphasize that the\nunderlying symmetry that stabilizes weakly interacting dark matter has\ntremendous implications for the LHC and our understanding of the nature of dark\nmatter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2009 19:15:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-29"}

The\nproposed $hp$-DG methods are defined using a sesquilinear form which is not\nonly mesh-dependent but also degree-dependent. In addition, the sesquilinear\nform contains penalty terms which not only penalize the jumps of the function\nvalues across the element edges but also the jumps of the first order\ntangential derivatives as well as jumps of all normal derivatives up to order\n$p$. Furthermore, to ensure the stability, the penalty parameters are taken as\ncomplex numbers with positive imaginary parts. It is proved that the proposed\n$hp$-discontinuous Galerkin methods are absolutely stable (hence, well-posed).\nFor each fixed wave number $k$, sub-optimal order error estimates in the broken\n$H^1$-norm and the $L^2$-norm are derived without any mesh constraint. The\nerror estimates and the stability estimates are improved to optimal order under\nthe mesh condition $k^3h^2p^{-1}\\le C_0$ by utilizing these stability and error\nestimates and using a stability-error iterative procedure To overcome the\ndifficulty caused by strong indefiniteness of the Helmholtz problems in the\nstability analysis for numerical solutions, our main ideas for stability\nanalysis are to make use of a local version of the Rellich identity (for the\nLaplacian) and to mimic the stability analysis for the PDE solutions given in\n\\cite{cummings00,Cummings_Feng06,hetmaniuk07}, which enable us to derive\nstability estimates and error bounds with explicit dependence on the mesh size\n$h$, the polynomial degree $p$, the wave number $k$, as well as all the penalty\nparameters for the numerical solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2009 16:23:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-21"}

In most models, the dark matter interacts\nweakly, but the possibility of a dark matter particle with a large cross\nsection for elastic scattering with itself has been proposed in several\ncontexts. I study the consequences of such dark matter self-interactions for\nthe high-energy neutrino flux from annihilation within the Sun. The\nself-interaction may allow dark matter in the halo to be captured within the\nSun by scattering off of previously-captured dark matter within the Sun. This\neffect is not negligible in acceptable and accessible regions of parameter\nspace. Enhancements in the predicted high-energy neutrino flux from the Sun of\ntens to hundreds of percent can be realized in broad regions of parameter\nspace. Enhancements as large as factors of several hundred may be realized in\nextreme regions of the viable parameter space. Large enhancements require the\ndark matter annihilation cross section to be relatively small, sigma*v <~\n10^-27 cm^3/s. This phenomenology is interesting. First, self-capture is\nnegligible for the Earth, so dark matter self-interactions break the\ncorrespondence between the solar and terrestrial neutrino signals. Likewise,\nthe correspondence between indirect and direct detection limits on scattering\ncross sections on nuclei is broken by the self-interaction. These broken\ncorrespondences may evince strong dark matter self-interactions. In some cases,\nself-capture can lead to observable indirect signals in regions of parameter\nspace where limits on dark matter-nucleon cross sections from direct detection\nwould indicate that no such signal should be observable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2009 19:56:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2009 11:51:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

We present a sample of 77 optical afterglows (OAs) of Swift\ndetected GRBs for which spectroscopic follow-up observations have been secured.\nWe provide linelists and equivalent widths for all detected lines redward of\nLy-alpha. We discuss to what extent the current sample of Swift bursts with OA\nspectroscopy is a biased subsample of all Swift detected GRBs. For that purpose\nwe define an X-ray selected sample of Swift bursts with optimal conditions for\nground-based follow up from the period March 2005 to September 2008; 146 bursts\nfulfill our sample criteria. We derive the redshift distribution for this\nsample and conclude that less than 19% of Swift bursts are at z>7. We compare\nthe high energy properties for three sub-samples of bursts in the sample: i)\nbursts with redshifts measured from OA spectroscopy, ii) bursts with detected\nOA, but no OA-based redshift, and iii) bursts with no detection of the OA. The\nbursts in group i) have significantly less excess X-ray absorption than bursts\nin the other two groups. In addition, the fraction of dark bursts is 14% in\ngroup i), 38% in group ii) and > 39% in group iii). From this we conclude that\nthe sample of GRBs with OA spectroscopy is not representative for all Swift\nbursts, most likely due to a bias against the most dusty sight-lines. Finally,\nwe characterize GRB absorption systems as a class and compare them to QSO\nabsorption systems, in particular DLAs. On average GRB absorbers are\ncharacterized by significantly stronger EWs for HI as well as for both low and\nhigh ionization metal lines than what is seen in intervening QSO absorbers.\nBased on the z>2 bursts in the sample we place a 95% confidence upper limit of\n7.5% on the mean escape fraction of ionizing photons from star-forming\ngalaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2009 19:13:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2009 13:48:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-01"}

We estimate the\ncontamination of the stellar continuum from scattered quasar light based on the\nstrength of broad H-beta, and provide an empirical calibration of the\ncontamination as a function of L_[O III]; the scattered light fraction is ~ 30%\nof L_5100 for objects with L_[O III] = 10^9.5 L_sun. Population synthesis\nindicates that young post-starburst populations (< 0.1 Gyr) are prevalent in\nluminous type 2 quasars, in addition to a relatively old population (> 1 Gyr)\nwhich dominates the stellar mass. Broad emission complexes around He II 4686 A\nwith luminosities up to 10^8.3 L_sun are unambiguously detected in three out of\nthe nine targets, indicative of Wolf-Rayet populations. Population synthesis\nshows that ~ 5-Myr post-starburst populations contribute substantially to the\nluminosities (> 50% of L_5100) of all three objects with Wolf-Rayet detections.\nWe find two objects with double cores and four with close companions. Our\nresults may suggest that luminous type 2 quasars trace an early stage of galaxy\ninteraction, perhaps responsible for both the quasar and the starburst\nactivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2009 02:05:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

This medium is seen not only around the Milky Way, but other\nspiral galaxies and it is related to the star formation rate, so it is likely\nproduced by the activity in the disk through a galactic fountain. More extended\nexamples of halo gas are seen, such as the HVC around the Milky Way and around\nM31. This gas is typically 10-20 kpc from the galaxy and is not seen beyond 50\nkpc. This gas is most likely being accreted. A hot dilute halo (1E6 K) is\npresent with a similar size, although its size is poorly determined.

We have confirmed that there is a correlation between the X-ray\nluminosity corresponding to the hard-to-soft transition and the X-ray\nluminosity of the following soft state. This correlation holds over a\nluminosity range spanning by two orders of magnitude, with no indication of a\nflux saturation or cut-off. We have also found that the transition luminosity\ncorrelates with the rate of increase in the X-ray luminosity during the rising\nphase of an outburst or flare, implying that the origin of the variation of the\ntransition luminosity is associated with non-stationary accretion in both\ntransient sources and persistent sources. The correlation between the\nluminosity corresponding to the end of the soft-to-hard transition and the peak\nluminosity of the preceding soft state is found insignificant. The results\nsuggest that the hysteresis effect of spectral state transitions is primarily\ndriven by non-stationary accretion when the mass accretion rate increases\nrather than the mass accretion rate decreases. Our results also imply that\nGalactic X-ray binaries can reach more luminous hard states during outbursts of\nhigher luminosities and of similar rise time scales as those observed. Based on\nthe correlations, we speculate that bright hard state beyond the Eddington\nluminosity will be observed in Galactic binaries in the next century.

We analyzed all\navailable observations carried out by RXTE on IGR J17473-2721 during its later\noutburst and as well all the available SWIFT/BAT data. The flux of the latter\noutburst rose in ~ one month and then kept roughly constant for the following ~\ntwo months. During this time period, the source was in a low/hard state. The\nsource moved to a high/soft state within the following three days, accompanied\nby the occurrence of an additional outburst at soft X-rays and the end of the\npreceding outburst in hard X-rays. During the decay of this soft outburst, the\nsource went back to a low/hard state within 6 days, with a luminosity 4 times\nlower than the first transition. This shows a full cycle of the hysteresis in\ntransition between the hard and the soft states. The fact that the flux\nremained roughly constant for ~ two months at times prior to the spectral\ntransition to a high/soft state might be regarded as the result of balancing\nthe evaporation of the inner disk and the inward accretion flow, in a model in\nwhich the state transition is determined by the mass flow rate. Such a balance\nmight be broken via an additional mass flow accreting onto the inner disk,\nwhich lightens the extra soft outburst and causes the state transition.\nHowever, the possibility of an origin of the emission from the jet during this\ntime period cannot be excluded.

It is a\ndensely populated clump of stars with an almost vertical structure in the\nF435W-(F435W-F625W) plane, that we termed \"blue clump\". A comparison with\ntheoretical models leads to the conclusion that this feature must necessarily\nharbor either hot flasher stars, or canonical He-rich stars --progeny of the\nblue Main Sequence sub population observed in this cluster-- or a mixture of\nboth types, plus possibly a component from the normal-He population hosted by\nthe cluster. A strong constraint coming from theory is that the mass of the\nobjects in the \"blue clump\" has to be very finely tuned, with a spread of at\nmost only $\\sim$0.03Mo. By comparing observed and theoretical star counts along\nboth the H- and He-burning stages we then find that at least 15% of the\nexpected He-rich Horizontal Branch stars are missing from the color-magnitude\ndiagram. This missing population could be the progeny of red giants that failed\nto ignite central He-burning and have produced He-core White Dwarfs. Our\nconclusion supports the scenario recently suggested by Calamida et al. (2008)\nfor explaining the observed ratio of White Dwarfs to Main Sequence stars in\nomega Centauri.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2009 06:25:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

In this paper we discuss the main difficulties of time domain\nsolvers, namely FDTD and FVTD and we compare various frequency domain solvers,\nnamely the commercial FEM packages JCMsuite, Comsol, HFSS,and Microwave Studio\nwith the semi-analytic MMP code that may be used as a reference due to its fast\nconvergence and high accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2009 08:02:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2010 13:08:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-12"}

Comparison with photoionization\nmodels indicates that bolometric luminosity (Lbol) estimates based on L(oiii\n5007A) severely underestimate Lbol in low ionization sources such as LINERs. An\nalternative method based on L(hb) is less sensitive to ionization level and a\nnovel method, based on a combination of L(oiii 5007A) and L(oi 6300A), is\nerhaps the best. Using this method I show that low ionization AGN are accreting\nfaster than assumed until now. Significant related other findings are: 1. Any\ntype-II AGN property related to the black hole (BH) mass is more reliably\nobtained by removing blue galaxies from the sample. 2. Seyfert 2s and LINER 2s\nform a continuous sequence of L/Ledd with no indication for a change in\naccretion mechanism, or mode of mass supply. There are very few, if any, LINERs\nin all type-I samples which results in a much arrower L/Ledd distribution\ncompared with type-II samples. 3. There is a strong correlation between SF\nluminosity, Lsf, and Lbol over more than five orders of magnitude in\nluminosity. This leads to a simple relationship between bulge and BH growth\nrates, g(bulge)/g(BH) propto Lbol^(-0.2), where g(bulge)/g(BH) = 115 for\nLbol=10^42 erg/sec. Seyfert 2s and LINER 2s follow the same Lsf-Lbol\ncorrelation for all sources with a stellar age indicator, D4000, smaller than\n1.8.

This is despite\nthe fact that for low densities the system is expected to be well modeled by\nthe Hubbard model, which is predicted to have a ferromagnetic ground state at\nT=0 on 2- or 3-dimensional bipartite lattices in the limit of strong\ncorrelation near half-filling. We examine the impurity band formed by\nhydrogenic centers in semiconductors at low densities, and show that it is\ndescribed by a generalized Hubbard model which has, in addition to strong\nelectron-electron interaction and disorder, an intrinsic electron-hole\nasymmetry. With the help of mean field methods as well as exact diagonalization\nof clusters around half filling, we can establish the existence of a\nferromagnetic ground state, at least on the nanoscale, which is more robust\nthan that found in the standard Hubbard model.
