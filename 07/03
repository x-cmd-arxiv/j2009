Furthermore, the spectrum shows strong, broad\nemission features at 8 and 12 micron that are observed in Galactic carbon-rich\nproto-planetary nebulae. Combining these data with published optical and\nnear-IR photometry obtained at the same epoch, we find that the mid-IR excess\ntraced by the Spitzer spectrum accounts for ~20% of the total energy output.\nThis component can be well explained by emission from ~3x10^-4 Msun of\npre-existing progenitor dust at temperature ~400 K. The spectral energy\ndistribution of the transient also shows a near-IR excess that can be explained\nby emission from newly-formed dust in the ejecta. Alternatively, both the\nnear-IR and mid-IR excesses can together be explained by a single pre-existing\ngeometrically thick dust shell. In light of the new observations obtained with\nSpitzer, we revisit the analysis of the optical spectra and kinematics, which\nwere compared to the massive yellow-hypergiant IRC+10420 in previous studies.\nWe show that proto-planetary nebulae share many properties with the NGC 300\ntransient and SN 2008S. We conclude that even though the explosion of a massive\nstar (> 10 Msun) cannot be ruled out, an explosive event on a massive (6-10\nMsun) carbon-rich AGB/super-AGB or post-AGB star is consistent with all\nobservations of the transients and their progenitors presented thus far.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2009 17:33:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2009 03:31:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2009 16:42:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-02"}

We detect the average SZE at a very high significance\nlevel. The average cluster signal is spatially resolved in the W band. This\nmean signal is compared with the expected signal from the same clusters\ncalculated on the basis of archival ROSAT data. From the comparison we conclude\nthat the observed SZE seems to be less than the expected signal derived from\nX-ray measurements when a standard beta-model is assumed for the gas\ndistribution. This conclusion is model dependent. Our predictions depend mostly\non the assumptions made about the core radius of clusters and the slope of the\ngas density profile. Models with steeper profiles are able to simultaneously\nfit both X-ray and WMAP data better than a beta-model. However, the agreement\nis not perfect and we find that it is still difficult to make the X-ray and SZE\nresults agree. A model assuming point source contamination in SZE clusters\nrenders a better fit to the one-dimensional SZE profiles thus suggesting that\ncontamination from point sources could be contributing to a diminution of the\nSZE signal. Selecting a model that better fits both X-ray and WMAP data away\nfrom the very central region, we estimate the level of contamination and find\nthat on average, the point source contamination is on the level of 16 mJy (at\n41 GHz), 26 mJy (at 61 GHz) and 18 mJy (at 94 GHz). These estimated fluxes are\nmarginally consistent with the estimated contamination derived from radio and\ninfrared surveys thus suggesting that the combination of a steeper gas profile\nand the contribution from point sources allows us to consistently explain the\nX-ray emission and SZE in galaxy clusters as measured by ROSAT and WMAP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2009 16:21:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-29"}

In the disruption regime, we derive\nthe criteria for catastrophic disruption (when half the total colliding mass is\nlost), the transition energy between accretion and erosion, and a scaling law\nfor the change in bulk composition (iron-to-silicate ratio) resulting from\ncollisional stripping of a mantle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2009 16:06:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-22"}

We attempt here to overcome the spatial\nresolution limitations of conventional thermal infrared imaging. We employed\nmid-infrared interferometry using the MIDI instrument on the ESO/VLTI facility\nto investigate M8E-IR, a well-known massive young stellar object suspected of\ncontaining a circumstellar disk. Spectrally dispersed visibilities in the 8-13\nmicron range were obtained at seven interferometric baselines. We resolve the\nmid-infrared emission of M8E-IR and find typical sizes of the emission regions\nof the order of 30 milli-arcseconds (~45 AU). Radiative transfer simulations\nhave been performed to interpret the data. The fitting of the spectral energy\ndistribution, in combination with the measured visibilities, does not provide\nevidence for an extended circumstellar disk with sizes > 100 AU but requires\nthe presence of an extended envelope. The data are not able to constrain the\npresence of a small-scale disk in addition to an envelope.

Towards this\nstar, the silicate band is seen in emission. This emission feature is used to\nmodel the dust content of the circumstellar disc. Clear signs of dust\nprocessing are found. Towards T Tau S, the silicate band is seen in absorption.\nThis absorption is strongly pronounced towards the infrared companion T Tau Sa\nas can be seen from the first individual N-band spectra for the two southern\ncomponents. Our fits support the previous suggestion that an almost edge-on\ndisc is present around T Tau Sa. This disc is thus misaligned with respect to\nthe circumstellar disc around T Tau N. The interferometric data indicate that\nthe disc around T Tau Sa is oriented in the north-south direction, which\nfavours this source as launching site for the east-western jet. We further\ndetermine from the interferometric data the relative positions of the\ncomponents of the southern binary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2009 19:02:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

For this we suggest to consider the viewpoint that\nspatio-temporal relations between objects are emergent and that they are but a\nresult of complex interactions of objects. Such an approach is a natural\ncontinuation of the revision of the notions of space and time started by the\ngeneral theory of relativity. It leads to a possible extension of the structure\nof the classical mechanics. Namely, the result of the objects interactions can\nbe wider than the spatio-temporal relations. In this case interactions form a\ngeneralized space (\"Field-Space\") wider than its spatio-temporal section (while\nthe known interactions are embedded within that section). The study of such\nhypothesis demands constructing a theory, not relying on space and time as\nprimitive notions. As primary elements of such a theory we consider objects and\npurely informational connections between them, not expressed in spatio-temporal\nterms. Following the logic of this theory, the world constitutes a complex\ninformation web. The Web is in the state of a constant flux (of a more general\ncategory than the one of the quantum fields) - an incessant change of\nconnections, the complex order of which comprises the order of chaos. Reminding\nthe space build-up from the Regge skeleton, the Web builds a unified\nField-Space of pure information, manifested in space as energy distribution. We\ndescribe the emergence of spatio-temporal laws from the viewpoint of purely\ninformational physics.

This alignment could reduce the flavor violating effects to levels\nwhich allow for a Kaluza-Klein scale as low as 2-3 TeV, making the model\nobservable at the LHC. However, the up-type Yukawa couplings on the IR brane,\nwhich are bounded from below by recent bounds on CP violation in the D system,\ninduce flavor misalignment radiatively. Off-diagonal down-type Yukawa couplings\nand kinetic mixings for the down quarks are both consequences of this effect.\nThese radiative Yukawa corrections can be reduced by raising the flavon VEV on\nthe IR brane (at the price of some moderate tuning), or by extending the Higgs\nsector. The flavor changing effects from the radiatively induced Yukawa mixing\nterms are at around the current upper experimental bounds.

Taking O to be an octant of S^2, we compute the\ninfimum Dirichlet energy, Ecal(H), for continuous maps satisfying tangent\nboundary conditions of arbitrary homotopy type H. The expression for Ecal(H)\ninvolves a topological invariant - the spelling length - associated with the\n(nonabelian) fundamental group of the n-times punctured two-sphere, pi_1(S^2 -\n{s_1,..., s_n},*). The lower bound for Ecal(H) is obtained from combinatorial\ngroup theory arguments, while the upper bound is obtained by constructing\nexplicit representatives which, on all but an arbitrarily small subset of O,\nare alternatively locally conformal or anticonformal. For conformal and\nanticonformal classes (classes containing wholly conformal and anticonformal\nrepresentatives respectively), the expression for Ecal(H) reduces to a previous\nresult involving the degrees of a set of regular values s_1,..., s_n in the\ntarget S^2 space. These degrees may be viewed as invariants associated with the\nabelianization of \\pi_1(S^2 - {s_1,..., s_n}, *). For nonconformal classes,\nhowever, Ecal(H) may be strictly greater than the abelian bound. This stems\nfrom the fact that, for nonconformal maps, the number of preimages of certain\nregular values may necessarily be strictly greater than the absolute value of\ntheir degrees.\n  This work is motivated by the theoretical modelling of nematic liquid\ncrystals in confined polyhedral geometries.

We have obtained that the structural parameters of E/S0 galaxies are\nsimilar to those showed by galaxies in low redshift clusters. However, the disc\nscales are different. In particular, the scales of the discs of galaxies at\nmedium redshift clusters are statistically different than those located in\nsimilar galaxies in the Coma cluster. But, the scales of the discs of galaxies\nin medium redshift clusters are similar to nearby field galaxies.\n  Conclusions: The results suggest that the evolution of the disc component of\ngalaxies in clusters is faster than in field ones. Mechanisms like galaxy\nharassment showing timescales of $\\sim 1$Gyr could be the responsible of this\ndisc scale evolution. This indicates that spiral galaxies in clusters have\nsuffered a strong evolution in the last 2.5 Gyr or that Coma is in some way\nanomalous.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2009 20:09:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The effective\ninteraction depends on the strength of the confinement enforcing the 1D motion\nof atoms; interaction may be further enhanced by superimposing an optical\nlattice on the trap potential. In the compressible state, we find that the\nsmooth variation of the gas density around the trap center leads to softening\nof the singular behavior of S(q,omega) at Lieb-1 mode compared to the behavior\npredicted for homogeneous 1D systems. Nevertheless, the density-averaged\nresponse remains a non-analytic function of q and omega at Lieb-1 mode in the\nlimit of weak trap confinement. The exponent of the power-law non-analyticity\nis modified due to the inhomogeneity in a universal way, and thus, bears\nunambiguously the information about the (homogeneous) Lieb-Liniger model.

Recent studies suggest that it may also play a vital role in enabling\nthe evolution of species. Increasing robustness, so is proposed, can lead to\nthe emergence of evolvability if evolution proceeds over a neutral network that\nextends far throughout the fitness landscape. Here, we show that the design\nprinciples used to achieve robustness dramatically influence whether robustness\nleads to evolvability. In simulation experiments, we find that purely redundant\nsystems have remarkably low evolvability while degenerate, i.e. partially\nredundant, systems tend to be orders of magnitude more evolvable. Surprisingly,\nthe magnitude of observed variation in evolvability can neither be explained by\ndifferences in the size nor the topology of the neutral networks. This suggests\nthat degeneracy, a ubiquitous characteristic in biological systems, may be an\nimportant enabler of natural evolution.

A well-known example is the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)\ncascade, where in each layer of the cascade a protein is phosphorylated at two\nsites. It has long been known that the response of a MAPK pathway strongly\ndepends on whether the enzymes that modify the protein act processively or\ndistributively: distributive mechanism, in which the enzyme molecules have to\nrelease the substrate molecules in between the modification of the two sites,\ncan generate an ultrasensitive response and lead to hysteresis and bistability.\nWe study by Green's Function Reaction Dynamics, a stochastic scheme that makes\nit possible to simulate biochemical networks at the particle level and in time\nand space, a dual phosphorylation cycle in which the enzymes act according to a\ndistributive mechanism. We find that the response of this network can differ\ndramatically from that predicted by a mean-field analysis based on the chemical\nrate equations. In particular, rapid rebindings of the enzyme molecules to the\nsubstrate molecules after modification of the first site can markedly speed up\nthe response, and lead to loss of ultrasensitivity and bistability. In essence,\nrapid enzyme-substrate rebindings can turn a distributive mechanism into a\nprocessive mechanism. We argue that slow ADP release by the enzymes can protect\nthe system against these rapid rebindings, thus enabling ultrasensitivity and\nbistability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jul 2009 15:36:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The other one is two-dimensional\ngeneral relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) code. I have performed\nnumerical simulations of collapsars using these codes and realistic progenitor\nmodels. In the Newtonian code, it is found that neutrino heating processes are\nnot efficient enough to launch a jet in this study.

However, since the ratio of total energy relative to the rest-mass\nenergy in the jet is not as high as several hundred, we conclude that the jets\nseen in this study are not GRB jets. In the GRMHD simulation, it is shown that\na jet is launched from the center of the progenitor. We also find that the mass\naccretion rate after the launch of the jet shows rapid time variability that\nresembles to a typical time profile of a GRB. We find that the energy flux per\nunit rest-mass flux is as high as 10^2 at the bottom of the jet. Thus we\nconclude that the bulk Lorentz factor of the jet can be potentially high when\nit propagates outward.

Among various scenarios proposed\nto explain the nature of the outburst, the most promising is a stellar merger\nevent. The results of spectroscopic observations of the object obtained in\nOctober 2005 with the Keck/HIRES instrument, presented in detail in Paper I,\nare analysed and discussed. Our analysis of the molecular bands and the P-Cyg\nprofiles of atomic lines shows that the object loses matter with a velocity of\nup to 215 km/s and a rate of 10^{-6} - 10^{-5} M_sun/yr. In the profiles of\nsome atomic lines, we have also found evidence of matter infall. A narrow\nabsorption component, which is particularly strong in some P-Cyg profiles, may\nindicate that a jet-like outflow has also been formed. We show that the\nobserved emission in the [Fe II] lines and an eclipse-like event observed in\nNovember/December 2006 was probably caused by interactions of the expanding\nmatter, ejected by V838 Mon in 2002, with radiation from the B3V companion. In\nparticular, the observed profiles of the [Fe II] lines can be easily modelled\nin this scenario and allow us to estimate parameters of the system, such as the\nposition of the B3V companion relative to V838 Mon and the line of sight,\ndensity in the outflowing matter, and mass lost in the 2002 eruption. The\nobserved appearance of strong H-alpha emission, just before and during the\neclipse-like event, can be interpreted as a result of the accretion of the\noutflowing matter onto the B3V companion: the accreted matter, shocked above\nthe stellar surface, can be a source of extreme-UV and soft X-ray radiation\ncapable of ionizing and exciting H in the outflow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jul 2009 09:40:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

First, we propose a general collective inference framework\nthat biases data instances to agree on a set of {\\em properties} of their\nlabelings. Agreement is encouraged through symmetric clique potentials. We show\nthat rich properties leads to bigger gains, and present a systematic inference\nprocedure for a large class of such properties.

Our second\nmajor contribution consists of algorithms for computing outgoing messages from\nclique clusters with symmetric clique potentials.

Several issues need to be considered such as the existence of\nmultiple competing objectives and the complexity of the operating environment.\nA particular challenge is posed by the various types of uncertainty that the\nfuture might hold. It is uncertain what future events might be encountered; how\nfleet design decisions will influence and shape the future; and how present and\nfuture decision makers will act based on available information, their personal\nbiases regarding the importance of different objectives, and their economic\npreferences. In order to assist strategic decision-making, an analysis of\nfuture fleet options needs to account for conditions in which these different\nclasses of uncertainty are exposed. It is important to understand what\nassumptions a particular fleet is robust to, what the fleet can readily adapt\nto, and what conditions present clear risks to the fleet. We call this the\nanalysis of a fleet's strategic positioning. This paper introduces how\nstrategic positioning can be evaluated using computer simulations. Our main aim\nis to introduce a framework for capturing information that can be useful to a\ndecision maker and for defining the concepts of robustness and adaptiveness in\nthe context of future fleet design.

Proposed changes to a fleet are then analysed\nbased on their influence on the fleet's robustness, adaptiveness, and risk to\ndifferent scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jul 2009 11:23:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-06"}

At\npresent, cloud activity mainly occurs in the southern (summer) hemisphere,\narising near the pole and at mid-latitudes from cumulus updrafts triggered by\nsurface heating and/or local methane sources, and at the north (winter) pole,\nresulting from the subsidence and condensation of ethane-rich air into the\ncolder troposphere. General circulation models predict that this distribution\nshould change with the seasons on a 15-year timescale, and that clouds should\ndevelop under certain circumstances at temperate latitudes (~40\\degree) in the\nwinter hemisphere. The models, however, have hitherto been poorly constrained\nand their long-term predictions have not yet been observationally verified.\nHere we report that the global spatial cloud coverage on Titan is in general\nagreement with the models, confirming that cloud activity is mainly controlled\nby the global circulation. The non-detection of clouds at latitude ~40\\degree N\nand the persistence of the southern clouds while the southern summer is ending\nare, however, both contrary to predictions.

Analysis of the data reveals a spectrum of solar-like acoustic\noscillations. However, the faintness of the target (m_v=7.65) means the\nsignal-to-noise (S/N) in the acoustic modes is quite low, and this low S/N\nleads to complications in the analysis. Aims: To extract global variables of\nthe star as well as key parameters of the p modes observed in the power\nspectrum of the lightcurve. Methods: The power spectrum of the lightcurve, a\nwavelet transform and spot fitting have been used to obtain the average\nrotation rate of the star and its inclination angle.

We\ncollected dielectric constant values for the Cassini radar wavelength ($\\sim\n2.2$ cm) for materials of interest for Titan: liquid methane, liquid mixture of\nmethane-ethane, water ice and light hydrocarbon ices. Due to the lack of\npermittivity values for Titan's haze particles in the microwave range, we\nperformed dielectric constant ($\\varepsilon_r$) measurements around 2.2 cm on\ntholins synthesized in laboratory.

In the light of possible magnetoelectric coupling in\nthese doped ceramics, the dielectric measurements were also carried out in\nexternal magnetic fields up to 7 T, showing a minor but significant dependence\nof the dielectric constant on the applied magnetic field.

For the second one, we also briefly investigate the\ntemperature dependence of elastic constants in rod-like regime and in the\nvicinity of the Landau point and comment on the smectic phases. In every case\nwe take into account rigid molecules. We find that the Landau points acquired\nfrom the square root rule for hard biaxial ellipsoids retain its significance,\nand provide qualitatively correct estimations of Landau points positions for\nGay-Berne biaxial ellipsoids. In case of the bent-core model molecules build\nfrom uniaxial and biaxial Gay-Berne ellipsoids we find that the dipole-dipole\ninteraction and degree of arms biaxiality change the stability of the biaxial\nnematic phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jul 2009 15:21:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-07"}
