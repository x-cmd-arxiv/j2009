The theory explicitly breaks Lorentz\ninvariance, which introduces an apparent extra scalar degree of freedom. In\nthis note, we show that the low energy limit of (non-projectible)\nHorava-Lifshitz gravity is uniquely given by the quadratic cuscuton model: a\ncovariant scalar field theory with an infinite speed of sound and a quadratic\npotential, which is minimally coupled to Einstein gravity. This implies that\nthe extra scalar is non-dynamical to all orders in perturbation theory. Using\ncurrent cosmological constraints on the quadratic cuscuton model, we can\nconstrain the low energy Lorentz breaking parameter of Horava-Lifshitz theory\n(which leads to a running of Planck mass on the Hubble scale) to |lambda-1| <\n0.014 (at 95% confidence level). We also point out that, with reasonable\nboundary conditions, the spatial hypersurfaces in this theory are constant mean\ncurvature (CMC) or uniform expansion surfaces at low energies, and introduce\ngeometrical symmetries that can protect the non-dynamical nature of these\ntheories from quantum corrections. We also notice that the theory with lambda <\n1 might suffer from a non-perturbative UV instability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2009 19:46:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2009 15:59:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-05"}

The structure of the electron pockets is clarified by studying high\ndoping contents, where they are enlarged. They are found to be essentially\ncircular and two dimensional. From the size of the pockets, we deduce the\nnumber of holes and electrons present at the various dopings. We find that the\nnet number of carriers is in good agreement with the bulk stoichiometry, but\nthat the number of each species (holes and electrons) is smaller than predicted\nby theory. Finally, we discuss the quality of nesting in the different regions\nof the phase diagram. The presence of the third hole pocket significantly\nweakens the nesting at x=0, so that it may not be a crucial ingredient in the\nformation of the Spin Density Wave. On the other hand, superconductivity seems\nto be favored by the coexistence of two-dimensional hole and electron pockets\nof similar sizes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2009 17:11:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

For Gaussian channels with secrecy constraints, however, efforts to\ndate rely on random codes. In this work, we advocate that structured codes are\nuseful for providing secrecy, and show how to compute the secrecy rate when\nstructured codes are used. In particular, we solve the problem of bounding\nequivocation rates with one important class of structured codes, i.e., nested\nlattice codes. Having established this result, we next demonstrate the use of\nstructured codes for secrecy in two-user Gaussian channels. In particular, with\nstructured codes, we prove that a positive secure degree of freedom is\nachievable for a large class of fully connected Gaussian channels as long as\nthe channel is not degraded. By way of this, for these channels, we establish\nthat structured codes outperform Gaussian random codes at high SNR. This class\nof channels include the two-user multiple access wiretap channel, the two-user\ninterference channel with confidential messages and the two-user interference\nwiretap channel. A notable consequence of this result is that, unlike the case\nwith Gaussian random codes, using structured codes for both transmission and\ncooperative jamming, it is possible to achieve an arbitrary large secrecy rate\ngiven enough power.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2009 18:28:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-31"}

Assuming\nthe Higgs is a fundamental scalar, we find: 1) the coefficient of O_H is\npositive except when there are triplet scalars, resulting in a reduction in the\nHiggs on-shell coupling from their standard model (SM) expectations if no other\noperators contribute, 2) the linear combination of O_H and O_y controlling the\noverall Higgs coupling to fermion is always reduced, 3) the sign of O_g induced\nby a new colored fermion is such that it interferes destructively with the SM\ntop contribution in the gluon fusion production of the Higgs, if the new\nfermion cancels the top quadratic divergence in the Higgs mass, and 4) the\ncorrelation between naturalness and the sign of O_gamma is similar to that of\nO_g, when there is a new set of heavy electroweak gauge bosons.

We find that the\ncompanion source is a luminous galaxy, the light profile of which suggests the\npresence of an unresolved, faint nucleus (either an obscured AGN or a compact\nstellar bulge). The study of the environment around the quasar indicates the\noccurrence of a significant over-density of galaxies with a redshift compatible\nwith z~0.4.

We investigate the total MF and the\ncontribution of ETGs and LTGs, defined by different criteria (SED, morphology\nor star formation). We unveil a galaxy bimodality in the global MF, better\nrepresented by 2 Schechter functions dominated by ETGs and LTGs, respectively.\nFor the global population we confirm that low-mass galaxies number density\nincreases later and faster than for massive galaxies. We find that the MF\nevolution at intermediate-low values of Mstar (logM<10.6) is mostly explained\nby the growth in stellar mass driven by smoothly decreasing star formation\nactivities. The low residual evolution is consistent with ~0.16 merger per\ngalaxy per Gyr (of which fewer than 0.1 are major). We find that ETGs increase\nin number density with cosmic time faster for decreasing Mstar, with a median\n\"building redshift\" increasing with mass, in contrast with hierarchical models.\nFor LTGs we find that the number density of blue or spiral galaxies remains\nalmost constant from z~1. Instead, the most extreme population of active star\nforming galaxies is rapidly decreasing in number density. We suggest a\ntransformation from blue active spirals of intermediate mass into blue\nquiescent and successively (1-2 Gyr after) into red passive types. The complete\nmorphological transformation into red spheroidals, required longer time-scales\nor follows after 1-2 Gyr. A continuous replacement of blue galaxies is expected\nby low-mass active spirals growing in stellar mass.

Due to the shared wireless channel and dynamic topology,\npacket transmissions suffer from interference and fading. In heterogeneous ad\nhoc networks, throughput via a given route is depending on the minimum data\nrate of all its links. In a route of links with various data rates, if a high\ndata rate node forwards more traffic to a low data rate node, there is a chance\nof congestion, which leads to long queuing delays in such routes. Since hop\ncount is used as a routing metric in traditional routing, it do not adapt well\nto mobile nodes. A congestion-aware routing metric for MANETs should\nincorporate transmission capability, reliability, and congestion around a link.\nIn this paper, we propose to develop a hop-by-hop congestion aware routing\nprotocol which employs a combined weight value as a routing metric, based on\nthe data rate, queuing delay, link quality and MAC overhead. Among the\ndiscovered routes, the route with minimum cost index is selected, which is\nbased on the node weight of all the in-network nodes. Simulation results prove\nthat our proposed routing protocol attains high throughput and packet delivery\nratio, by reducing the packet drop and delay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2009 22:31:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-03"}

The network consists of magneto-electric\ncells integrated onto a common ferromagnetic film - spin wave bus. The\nmagneto-electric cell is an artificial two-phase multiferroic structure\ncomprising piezoelectric and ferromagnetic materials. A bit of information is\nassigned to the cell's magnetic polarization, which can be controlled by the\napplied voltage. The information exchange among the cells is via the spin waves\npropagating in the spin wave bus. Each cell changes its state as a combined\neffect of two: the magneto-electric coupling and the interaction with the spin\nwaves. The distinct feature of the network with spin wave bus is the ability to\ncontrol the inter-cell communication by an external global parameter - magnetic\nfield. The latter makes possible to realize different image processing\nfunctions on the same template without rewiring or reconfiguration. We present\nthe results of numerical simulations illustrating image filtering, erosion,\ndilation, horizontal and vertical line detection, inversion and edge detection\naccomplished on one template by the proper choice of the strength and direction\nof the external magnetic field.

Fortunately, the large negative systemic velocity of M31, coupled\nto its high rotation rate, provides the means for separating the contaminating\nforeground dwarfs from the bona fide yellow supergiants within M31. Using the\nMMT, we obtained spectra of about 2900 stars, selected using the color and\nmagnitude range to be yellow supergiants. Comparing the velocities to that of\nM31's rotation curve, we identified 54 certain, and 66 probable yellow\nsupergiants from among the sea of foreground dwarfs. We find excellent\nagreement between the location of yellow supergiants in the H-R diagram and\nthat predicted by the latest Geneva evolutionary tracks which include rotation.\nHowever, the relative number of yellow supergiants seen as a function of mass\nvaries from that predicted by the models by a factor of more than 10, in the\nsense that more high mass yellow supergiants are predicted than are actually\nobserved. Comparing the total number of yellow supergiants with masses above\n20Mo with the estimated number of unevolved O stars indicates that the duration\nof the yellow supergiant phase is about 3000 years. This is consistent with\nwhat the 12Mo and 15Mo evolutionary tracks predict, but disagrees with the\n20,000-80,000 year time scales predicted by the models for higher masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2009 13:10:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Integrating over radii gives broad band continuum noise\npower between low and high frequency breaks which are set by the viscous\ntimescale at the outer and inner edge of the hot flow, respectively.\nLense-Thirring (vertical) precession of the entire hot flow superimposes the\nlow frequency QPO on this continuum power.\n  We test this model on the power spectra seen in the neutron star systems\n(atolls) as these have the key advantage that the (upper) kHz QPO most likely\nindependently tracks the truncation radius.

If (1) is correct, the expected rarity of a dynamical\ntransition onto an asteroidal orbit implies that 133P could be alone in the\nmain belt. In contrast, if (2) is correct, other icy main-belt objects should\nexist and could also exhibit cometary activity.

I conducted just\nsuch a survey -- the Hawaii Trails Project -- of selected main-belt asteroids\nin a search for objects displaying cometary activity.

The estimated rate of impacts and sizes of resulting\nactive sites, however, imply that 133P-sized bodies should become significantly\ndevolatilized over Gyr timescales, suggesting that 133P, and possibly the other\nMBCs as well, could be secondary, or even multigenerational, fragments from\nrecent breakup events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2009 11:04:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

We study\nthe problem by projecting the original fermionic Hamiltonian into magnon\nstates, which behave as bosons in the vicinity of the ferromagnetic ground\nstate. The approach permits the reformulation of a strongly interacting model\ninto a non-interacting one. The latter is a non-perturbative scheme that\nconsists in treating the two-particle neutral excitations of the electron\nsystem as a bosonic single-particle. Indeed, the employment of bosonization\nfacilitates the inclusion of disorder in the study of the system. It has been\nshown previously that disorder may drive a quantum phase transition in the Hall\nferromagnet. However, such studies have been either carried out in the\nframework of nonlinear sigma model, as an effective low-energy theory, or\nincluded the long-range Coulomb interaction in a quantum description only up to\nthe Hartree-Fock level.

Mossy fiber synapses appear to duplicate, in terms of\nthe information they convey, what CA3 cells already receive from entorhinal\ncortex layer II cells, which project both to the dentate gyrus and to CA3.\nComputational models of episodic memory have hypothesized that the function of\nthe mossy fibers is to enforce a new, well separated pattern of activity onto\nCA3 cells, to represent a new memory, prevailing over the interference produced\nby the traces of older memories already stored on CA3 recurrent collateral\nconnections. Can this hypothesis apply also to spatial representations, as\ndescribed by recent neurophysiological recordings in rats? To address this\nissue quantitatively, we estimate the amount of information DG can impart on a\nnew CA3 pattern of spatial activity, using both mathematical analysis and\ncomputer simulations of a simplified model. We confirm that, also in the\nspatial case, the observed sparse connectivity and level of activity are most\nappropriate for driving memory storage and not to initiate retrieval.\nSurprisingly, the model also indicates that even when DG codes just for space,\nmuch of the information it passes on to CA3 acquires a non-spatial and episodic\ncharacter, akin to that of a random number generator. It is suggested that\nfurther hippocampal processing is required to make full spatial use of DG\ninputs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2009 13:14:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

It is shown\nthat, in asymmetric structures, the relaxation of electron spin initially\noriented along the growth direction is characterized by two different lifetimes\nand leads to the appearance of an in-plane spin component. The magnitude and\nsign of the in-plane component are determined by the structure inversion\nasymmetry of the quantum well and can be tuned by the gate voltage. In an\nexternal magnetic field, the interplay of cyclotron motion of carriers and the\nLarmor precession of electron spin can result in a nonmonotonic dependence of\nthe spin density on the magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2009 15:52:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2009 11:14:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}
