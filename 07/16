This problem was\nconsidered by Boltzmann, Poincar\\'e, Bogolyubov and many other authors and\nthough some researchers claim that the problem is solved, it deserves a further\nstudy. In this paper an attempt is performed of the following solution of the\nirreversibility problem: a formulation of microscopic dynamics is suggested\nwhich is irreversible in time.\n  A widely used notion of microscopic state of the system at a given moment of\ntime as a point in the phase space and also a notion of trajectory does not\nhave an immediate physical meaning since arbitrary real numbers are non\nobservable. In the approach presented in this paper the physical meaning is\nattributed not to an individual trajectory but only to a bunch of trajectories\nor to the distribution function on the phase space.\n  The fundamental equation of the microscopic dynamics in the proposed\n\"functional\" approach is not the Newton equation but the Liouville equation for\nthe distribution function of a single particle. Solutions of the Liouville\nequation have the property of delocalization which accounts for\nirreversibility. It is shown that the Newton equation in this approach appears\nas an approximate equation describing the dynamics of the average values of the\nposition and momenta. Corrections to the Newton equation are computed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2009 17:49:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-05"}

Our monitoring shows that the\nlate time evolution of the radio supernova SN 2000ft follows a decline very\nsimilar to that displayed at earlier times of its optically thin phase. The\nlate time radio emission of SN 2000ft is therefore still being powered by its\ninteraction with the presupernova stellar wind, and not with the interstellar\nmedium (ISM). Indeed, the ram pressure of the presupernova wind is \\rho_w v_w^2\n\\approx 7.6E-9 dyn/cm^2, at a supernova age of approximately 2127 days, which\nis significantly larger than the expected pressure of the ISM around SN 2000ft.\nAt this age, the SN shock has reached a distance r_{sh \\approx 0.06 pc, and our\nobservations are probing the interaction of the SN with dense material that was\nejected by the presupernova star about 5820 years prior to its explosion.

In our model, new players can either make\nconnections to random preexisting players or preferentially attach to those\nthat have been successful in the past. The latter depends on the dynamics of\nstrategies in the game, which we implement following the so-called Fermi rule\nsuch that the limits of weak and strong strategy selection can be explored. Our\nframework allows to address general evolutionary games. With only two\nparameters describing the preferential attachment and the intensity of\nselection, we describe a wide range of network structures and evolutionary\nscenarios. Our results show that even for moderate payoff preferential\nattachment, over represented hubs arise. Interestingly, we find that while the\nnetworks are growing, high levels of cooperation are attained, but the same\nnetwork structure does not promote cooperation as a static network. Therefore,\nthe mechanism of payoff preferential attachment is different to those usually\ninvoked to explain the promotion of cooperation in static, already-grown\nnetworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2009 16:52:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

When comparing with other regions of the heliosphere, the fast\nsolar wind has the lowest density and the least frequent Coulomb collisions.\nThis makes the fast wind an optimal testing ground for studies of collisionless\nkinetic processes associated with the dissipation of plasma turbulence. Data\nfrom the Helios and Ulysses plasma instruments were collected to determine mean\nradial trends in the temperatures and the electron heat conduction flux between\n0.29 and 5.4 AU. The derived heating rates apply specifically for these mean\nplasma properties and not for the full range of measured values around the\nmean. We found that the protons receive about 60% of the total plasma heating\nin the inner heliosphere, and that this fraction increases to approximately 80%\nby the orbit of Jupiter. A major factor affecting the uncertainty in this\nfraction is the uncertainty in the measured radial gradient of the electron\nheat conduction flux. The empirically derived partitioning of heat between\nprotons and electrons is in rough agreement with theoretical predictions from a\nmodel of linear Vlasov wave damping. For a modeled power spectrum consisting\nonly of Alfvenic fluctuations, the best agreement was found for a distribution\nof wavenumber vectors that evolves toward isotropy as distance increases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2009 16:54:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The dependence of the\nelectron-nuclear spin dynamics on the correlation time $\\tau_c$ of electron\nspin precession, with frequency $\\Omega$, in the nuclear hyperfine field is\nanalyzed. It is demonstrated that the highest nuclear polarization is achieved\nfor a correlation time close to the period of electron spin precession in the\nnuclear field. For these and larger correlation times, the indirect hyperfine\nfield, which acts on nuclear spins, also reaches a maximum. This maximum is of\nthe order of the dipole-dipole magnetic field that nuclei create on each other.\nThis value is non-zero even if the average electron polarization vanishes.

The degree of modification depends strongly on the\nproperties of the galaxy cluster such as magnetic field strength and electron\nnumber density.

But the observations equally\nallow all the scalars to be heavy (including the Higgs), with masses ~ 1 TeV,\nwith the presence of the new scalars removing the light-Higgs preference that\nnormally emerges from fits to the electroweak precision data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2009 20:08:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2009 18:32:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2009 16:39:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-08"}

Not only is it commonly the strongest\nobservable line from high-redshift galaxies but from its shape detailed\ninformation about its host galaxy can be revealed. However, due to the\nscattering nature of Lya photons increasing their path length in a non-trivial\nway, if dust is present in the galaxy the line may be severely suppressed and\nits shape altered. In order to interpret observations correctly, it is thus of\ncrucial significance to know how much of the emitted light actually escapes the\ngalaxy.\n  In the present work, using a combination of high-resolution cosmological\nhydro-simulations and an adaptively refinable Monte Carlo Lya radiative\ntransfer code including an advanced model of dust, the escape fractions f_esc\nof Lya radiation from high-redshift (z = 3.6) galaxies are calculated. In\naddition to the average escape fraction, the variation of f_esc in different\ndirections and from different parts of the galaxies is investigated, as well as\nthe effect on the emergent spectrum.\n  Escape fractions from a sample of simulated galaxies of representative\nphysical properties are found to decrease for increasing galaxy virial mass\nM_vir, from f_esc approaching unity for M_vir ~ 10^9 M_sun to f_esc less than\n10% for M_vir ~ 10^12 M_sun. In spite of the dust being almost grey, it is\nfound that the emergent spectrum is affected non-uniformly, with the escape\nfraction of photons close to the line center being much higher than of those in\nthe wings, thus effectively narrowing the Lya line.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2009 07:54:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

We analyse 10637 QSOs in the\nredshift range 0.4<z<2.6 to a g-band flux limit of 21.85 (extinction corrected)\nand an absolute continuum magnitude of Mg(z=2)<-21.5.

(2005). The luminosity function is consistent\nwith other previous, much smaller, samples produced to the depth of 2SLAQ.\n  By combining the 2SLAQ and SDSS QSO samples we produce a QSO luminosity\nfunction with an unprecedented combination of precision and dynamic range.

While the overall trends seen in the evolution of the QSO LF appear\nsimilar to pure luminosity evolution, the data show very significant departures\nfrom such a model. Most notably we see clear evidence that the number density\nof faint QSOs peaks at lower redshift than bright QSOs: QSOs with Mg>-23 have\nspace densities which peak at z<1, while QSOs at Mg<-26 peak at z>2. By fitting\nsimple luminosity function models in narrow Mg intervals we find that this\ndownsizing is significant at the 99.98 per cent level (abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2009 01:37:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

In particular, we investigate the influence of a\npolytropic equation of state and of the effective adiabatic exponent $\\gamma$\nand find that it has a drastic influence on the low mass part of the IMF.

This ratio\ndoes not exhibit a strong evolution with z for the bulk of our sample galaxies\nbut some trends are found for galaxies with a strong dust attenuation and for\nUV luminous sources: galaxies with L_IR/L_UV>10 are more frequent at z>0 than\nat z=0 and the largest values of L_IR/L_UV are found for UV faint objects;\nconversely the most luminous galaxies of our samples (L_UV> 2 10^{10} L_sun$),\ndetected at z=1, exhibit a lower dust attenuation than the fainter ones.\nL_IR/L_UV increases with the K rest-frame luminosity of the galaxies at all the\nredshifts considered and shows a residual anti-correlation with L_UV. The most\nmassive and UV luminous galaxies exhibit quite large specific star formation\nrates. LBGs exhibit systematically lower dust attenuation than UV selected\ngalaxies of same luminosity but similar specific star formation rates. The\nanalysis of the UV+IR luminosity functions leads to the conclusion that up to z\n= 1 most of the star formation activity of UV selected galaxies is emitted in\nIR. Whereas we are able to retrieve all the star formation from our UV\nselection at z=0.7, at z = 1 we miss a large fraction of galaxies more luminous\nthan ~ 10^{11} L_sun. The effect is found larger for Lyman Break Galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2009 12:18:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

To network CRs\nrequires spectrum sensing at CR transmitter and further information regarding\nthe spectrum availability at CR receiver. Redefining the spectrum sensing along\nwith statistical inference suitable for cognitive radio networks (CRN), we\nmathematically derive conditions to allow CR transmitter forwarding packets to\nCR receiver under guaranteed outage probability, and prove that the correlation\nof localized spectrum availability between a cooperative node and CR receiver\ndetermines effectiveness of the cooperative scheme. Applying our novel\nmathematical model to potential hidden terminals in CRN, we illustrate that the\nallowable transmission region of a CR, defined as neighborhood, is no longer\ncircular shape even in a pure path loss channel model. This results in\nasymmetric CR links to make bidirectional links generally inappropriate in CRN,\nthough this challenge can be alleviated by cooperative sensing. Therefore,\nspectrum sensing capability determines CRN topology. For multiple cooperative\nnodes, to fully utilize spectrum availability, the selection methodology of\ncooperative nodes is developed due to limited overhead of information exchange.\nDefining reliability as information of spectrum availability at CR receiver\nprovided by a cooperative node and by applying neighborhood area, we can\ncompare sensing capability of cooperative nodes from both link and network\nperspectives. In addition, due to lack of centralized coordination in dynamic\nCRN, CRs can only acquire local and partial information within limited sensing\nduration, robust spectrum sensing is therefore proposed. Limits of cooperative\nschemes and their impacts on network operation are also derived.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2009 15:04:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-17"}
