Such a framework, where DM recoils against electrons bound\nin atoms, has been proposed as an explanation for the annually modulated\nscintillation signal in DAMA/LIBRA versus the absence of a signal for nuclear\nrecoils in experiments like CDMS or XENON10. However, even in such a\nleptophilic DM scenario there are loop induced DM-hadron interactions, where\nthe photons emitted from virtual leptons couple to the charge of a nucleus.\nUsing a general effective field theory approach we show that, if such an\ninteraction is induced at one or two-loop level, then DM-nucleus scattering\ndominates over DM-electron scattering. This is because the latter is suppressed\nby the bound state wave function. One obtains a situation similar to standard\nDM-nucleus scattering analyses with considerable tension between the results of\nDAMA and CDMS/XENON10. This conclusion does not apply in the case of\npseudoscalar or axial vector coupling between DM and leptons, where the loop\ndiagrams vanish. In this case the explanation of the DAMA signal in terms of\nDM-electron scattering is strongly disfavored by the spectral shape of the\nsignal.

The difference in the\ndegree of collimation between the two flows is caused by the strength of the\nmagnetic field and configuration of the magnetic field lines. The magnetic\nfield around an adiabatic core is strong and has an hourglass configuration.\nTherefore, the low-velocity outflow from the adiabatic core are driven mainly\nby the magnetocentrifugal mechanism and guided by the hourglass-like field\nlines. In contrast, the magnetic field around the protostar is weak and has a\nstraight configuration owing to Ohmic dissipation in the high-density gas\nregion. Therefore, high-velocity jet from the protostar are driven mainly by\nthe magnetic pressure gradient force and guided by straight field lines.\nDiffering depth of the gravitational potential between the adiabatic core and\nthe protostar cause the difference of the flow speed. Low-velocity outflows\ncorrespond to the observed molecular outflows, while high-velocity jets\ncorrespond to the observed optical jets. We suggest that the protostellar\noutflow and the jet are driven by different cores (the first adiabatic core and\nprotostar), rather than that the outflow being entrained by the jet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2009 01:04:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Main approaches in use at the present are based on variations\nof the classical Markowitz model. However, recent evolutions of the world\nmarket showed limitations of this method and motivated many researchers and\npractitioners to study alternative methodologies to portfolio construction. In\nthis paper we propose one approach to optimal portfolio construction based on\nrecent results on stochastic reachability, which overcome some of the limits of\ncurrent approaches. Given a sequence of target sets that the investors would\nlike their portfolio to stay within, the optimal portfolio allocation is\nsynthesized in order to maximize the joint probability for the portfolio value\nto fulfill the target sets requirements. A case study in the US market is given\nwhich shows benefits from the proposed methodology in portfolio construction.

The model is composed of three\ninterconnected neural submodels, each of them constituting a nonlinear\nmulti-input single-output error model. The structural identification and the\nparameter estimation from data gathered on a real engine are described. The\nneural direct model is then used to determine a neural controller of the\nengine, in a specialized training scheme minimising a multivariable criterion.\nSimulations show the effect of the pollution constraint weighting on a\ntrajectory tracking of the engine speed. Neural networks, which are flexible\nand parsimonious nonlinear black-box models, with universal approximation\ncapabilities, can accurately describe or control complex nonlinear systems,\nwith little a priori theoretical knowledge. The presented work extends optimal\nneuro-control to the multivariable case and shows the flexibility of neural\noptimisers.

We\nobtained light curves covering a 14 day timespan with a twice daily cadence for\n69 YSOs, and continuous light curves with approximately 12 second cadence over\n7 hours for 38 YSOs. Typical accuracies for our relative photometry were 1-2%\nfor the long timespan data and a few mmag, corresponding to less than 0.5%, for\nthe 7 hour continuous \"staring-mode\" data. More than half of the YSOs showed\ndetectable variability, with amplitudes from ~0.05 mag to ~0.2 mag. About\nthirty percent of the YSOs showed quasi-sinusoidal light curve shapes with\napparent periods from 5-12 days and light curve amplitudes approximately\nindependent of wavelength over the IRAC bandpasses. We have constructed models\nwhich simulate the time dependent spectral energy distributions of Class I and\nI I YSOs in order to attempt to explain these light curves. Based on these\nmodels, the apparently periodic light curves are best explained by YSO models\nwhere one or two high latitude photospheric spots heat the inner wall of the\ncircumstellar disk, and where we view the disk at fairly large inclination\nangle. Disk inhomogeneities, such as increasing the height where the accretion\nfunnel flows to the stellar hotspot, enhances the light curve modulations. The\nother YSOs in our sample show a range of light curve shapes, some of which are\nprobably due to varying accretion rate or disk shadowing events. One star,\nIC1396A-47, shows a 3.5 hour periodic light curve; this object may be a PMS\nDelta Scuti star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2009 09:48:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The reliability\nanalysis of any system provides an understanding about the likelihood of\nfailures occurring in the system/component and the increased insight about its\ninherent weakness. The objective of this paper is to quantify the uncertainties\nthat makes the decision more realistic, generic and extendable to application\ndomain. In this paper various reliability parameters (such as mean time between\nfailures, expected number of failures, reliability, availability etc.) are\ncomputed using Fuzzy Lambda-Tau methodology.

We further prove that\nthe S-K model exhibits multiple valleys in its energy landscape, in the weak\nsense that there are many states with near-minimal energy that are mutually\nnearly orthogonal. We show that the variance of the free energy of the S-K\nmodel is unusually small at any temperature.

The current activity minimum has\nattracted considerable interest because of its unusual duration and depth. This\nraises the question: what might be happening beneath the surface where the\nmagnetic activity ultimately originates? The surface activity can be linked to\nthe conditions in the solar interior by the observation and analysis of the\nfrequencies of the Sun's natural seismic modes of oscillation - the p modes.\nThese seismic frequencies respond to changes in activity and are probes of\nconditions within the Sun. The Birmingham Solar-Oscillations Network (BiSON)\nhas made measurements of p-mode frequencies over the last three solar activity\ncycles, and so is in a unique position to explore the current unusual and\nextended solar minimum. We show that the BiSON data reveal significant\nvariations of the p-mode frequencies during the current minimum. This is in\nmarked contrast to the surface activity observations, which show little\nvariation over the same period. The level of the minimum is significantly\ndeeper in the p-mode frequencies than in the surface observations. We observe a\nquasi-biennial signal in the p-mode frequencies, which has not previously been\nobserved at mid- and low-activity levels. The stark differences in the behavior\nof the frequencies and the surface activity measures point to activity-related\nprocesses occurring in the solar interior, which are yet to reach the surface,\nwhere they may be attenuated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2009 15:02:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-21"}

We show that both Jupiter's and Saturn's shapes can be derived\nusing solid-body rotation, suggesting that zonal winds have a minor effect on\nthe planetary shape for both planets. The agreement in the values of Saturn's\nrotation period predicted by the different approaches supports the conclusion\nthat the planet's period of rotation is about 10h 32m.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2009 15:04:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-28"}

Conductance reflects magnetism through anomalies\nat zero bias -- generally with Fano lineshapes -- due to the Kondo screening of\nthe magnetic impurity bridging the contact. A full atomic-level understanding\nof this nutshell many-body system is of the greatest importance, especially in\nview of our increasing need to control nanocurrents by means of magnetism.\nDisappointingly, zero bias conductance anomalies are not presently calculable\nfrom atomistic scratch. In this Letter we demonstrate a working route\nconnecting approximately but quantitatively density functional theory (DFT) and\nnumerical renormalization group (NRG) approaches and leading to a\nfirst-principles conductance calculation for a nanocontact, exemplified by a Ni\nimpurity in a Au nanowire. A Fano-like conductance lineshape is obtained\nmicroscopically, and shown to be controlled by the impurity s-level position.\nWe also find a relationship between conductance anomaly and geometry, and\nuncover the possibility of opposite antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic Kondo\nscreening -- the latter exhibiting a totally different and unexplored zero bias\nanomaly. The present matching method between DFT and NRG should permit the\nquantitative understanding and exploration of this larger variety of Kondo\nphenomena at more general magnetic nanocontacts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2009 15:30:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

A crucial\nstep of MS data processing is the peak picking which selects peaks containing\ninformation about molecules with high concentrations which are of interest in\nan MS investigation. We present a new procedure of the peak picking based on a\nsparse coding algorithm. Given a set of spectra of different classes, i.e. with\ndifferent positions and heights of the peaks, this procedure can extract peaks\nby means of unsupervised learning. Instead of an $l_1$-regularization penalty\nterm used in the original sparse coding algorithm we propose using an\nelastic-net penalty term for better regularization. The evaluation is done by\nmeans of simulation. We show that for a large region of parameters the proposed\npeak picking method based on the sparse coding features outperforms a mean\nspectrum-based method.
