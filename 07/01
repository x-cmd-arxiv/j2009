The transient\nsurvey is performed using a new 8.1 square degree camera installed on the\n48-inch Samuel Oschin telescope at Palomar Observatory; colors and light curves\nfor detected transients are obtained with the automated Palomar 60-inch\ntelescope. PTF uses eighty percent of the 1.2-m and fifty percent of the 1.5-m\ntelescope time. With an exposure of 60-s the survey reaches a depth of\napproximately 21.3 in g' and 20.6 in R (5 sigma, median seeing). Four major\nexperiments are planned for the five-year project: 1) a 5-day cadence supernova\nsearch; 2) a rapid transient search with cadences between 90 seconds and 1 day;\n3) a search for eclipsing binaries and transiting planets in Orion; and 4) a\n3-pi sr deep H-alpha survey. PTF provides automatic, realtime transient\nclassification and follow up, as well as a database including every source\ndetected in each frame. This paper summarizes the PTF project, including\nseveral months of on-sky performance tests of the new survey camera, the\nobserving plans and the data reduction strategy. We conclude by detailing the\nfirst 51 PTF optical transient detections, found in commissioning data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2009 19:12:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

In this paper,\nwe study the existence and construction of fusion frames. We first present a\ncomplete characterization of a special class of fusion frames, called Parseval\nfusion frames. The value of Parseval fusion frames is that the inverse fusion\nframe operator is equal to the identity and therefore signal reconstruction can\nbe performed with minimal complexity. We then introduce two general methods --\nthe spatial complement and the Naimark complement -- for constructing a new\nfusion frame from a given fusion frame. We then establish existence conditions\nfor fusion frames with desired properties. In particular, we address the\nfollowing question: Given $M, N, m \\in \\NN$ and $\\{\\lambda_j\\}_{j=1}^M$, does\nthere exist a fusion frame in $\\RR^M$ with $N$ subspaces of dimension $m$ for\nwhich $\\{\\lambda_j\\}_{j=1}^M$ are the eigenvalues of the associated fusion\nframe operator?

Remarkably, its numerical value mu_{0 D} = 140\nM_{sun}/pc^2 = (18.6 Mev)^3 is approximately the same (up to a factor of two)\nin all these systems. First, we present the physical consequences of the\nindependence of mu_{0 D} on r_0: the energy scales as the volume sim r_0^3\nwhile the mass and the entropy scale as the surface ~ r_0^2 and the surface\ntimes log r_0, respectively. Namely, the entropy scales similarly to the\nblack-hole entropy but with a much smaller coefficient. Second, we compute the\nsurface gravity and the density profile for small scales from first principles\nand the evolution of primordial density fluctuations since the end of inflation\ntill today using the linearized Boltzmann-Vlasov equation. The density profile\nrho_{lin}(r) obtained in this way decreases as r^{-1-n_s/2} for intermediate\nscales where n_s = 0.964 is the primordial spectral index. This scaling is in\nremarkable agreement with the empirical behaviour found observationally and in\nN-body simulations: r^{-1.6\\pm 0.4}.

(2006)) match\nwell the abundance in MICE up to M ~ 10^{14}\\Msun, but significantly deviate\nfor larger masses, underestimating the mass function by 10% (30%) at M = 3.16 x\n10^{14}\\Msun (10^{15}\\Msun). Similarly, the widely used Sheth & Tormen (1999)\nfit, if extrapolated to high redshift assuming universality, leads to an\nunderestimation of the cluster abundance by 30%, 20% and 15% at z=0, 0.5, 1 for\nM ~ [7 - 2.5 - 0.8] x 10^{14}\\Msun respectively ($\\nu = \\delta_c/\\sigma ~ 3$).\nWe provide a re-calibration of the halo MF valid over 5 orders of magnitude in\nmass, 10^{10} < M/(\\Msun) < 10^{15}, that accurately describes its redshift\nevolution up to z=1. We explore the impact of this re-calibration on the\ndetermination of dark-energy, and conclude that using available fits may\nsystematically bias the estimate of w by as much as 50% for medium-depth (z <=\n1) surveys.

The calculation results indicate that, for an\ninitial massive white dwarf of $1.2M_{\\odot}$, a considerable fraction of SNe\nIa may result from super-Chandresekhar mass white dwarfs, but very massive\n($>1.7 M_{\\sun}$) white dwarfs are difficult to form, and none of them could be\nfound in old populations. However, super-Chandrasekhar mass SNe Ia are very\nrare when the initial mass of white dwarfs is $1.0M_{\\odot}$. Additionally, SNe\nIa in low metallicity environment are more likely to be homogeneous.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2009 02:44:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 Jul 2009 01:11:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-24"}

The nature of CO lines shows an\nabrupt change at logW/nu = -4.75, and the lines stronger than this limit can no\nlonger be analyzed by the classical line-formation theory. A more simple\nmanifestation of this fact is that the curves-of-growth (CG) of CO lines show\nan unpredictable upturn at logW/nu = -4.75. Similar unusual behaviors of\nempirical CG are confirmed in other red (super)giant stars, and it looks as if\nthe CG is a hybrid of at least two components of different origins. Although\nstrong lines of the CO fundamentals observed in Arcturus show strengthening\ncompared with the predicted photospheric spectrum, the weaker lines show slight\nweakening, and we interpret these results as due to absorption/emission by the\nmolecular clouds formed in the extended atmosphere. Now do clouds exist in\nstellar atmospheres? It is by no means easy to answer this question by\nspectroscopic observations alone, but we find several arguments in favor of\nsuch a possibility in Arcturus by analyzing the CO lines. In cooler\n(super)giant stars in which CO lines show similar unusual behaviors as in\nArcturus, the presence of molecular clouds in the outer atmospheres was\ndemonstrated by direct observations with spatial interferometry.

No experimental value for the\n63Ni(n,gamma) cross section exists so far, and until recently the experimental\nvalues for 62Ni(n,gamma) at stellar temperatures (kT=30 keV) ranged between 12\nand 37 mb. This latter discrepancy could now be solved by two activations with\nfollowing AMS using the GAMS setup at the Munich tandem accelerator which are\nalso in perfect agreement with a recent time-of-flight measurement. The\nresulting (preliminary) Maxwellian cross section at kT=30 keV was determined to\nbe <sigma>30keV = 23.4 +/- 4.6 mb. Additionally, we have measured the\n64Ni(gamma,n)63Ni cross section close to threshold.

The wide and very deep NIR data allow us to\nmeasure the number density of galaxies down to low stellar mass (10^9-10^10\nMsun) even at high redshift with high statistical accuracy. The normalization\nof the mass function decreases with redshift and the integrated stellar mass\ndensity becomes ~ 8-18% of the local value at z~2 and ~ 4-9% at z~3, which are\nconsistent with results of previous studies in general fields. Furthermore, we\nfound that the low-mass slope becomes steeper with redshift from alpha ~- 1.3\nat z~1 to alpha ~- 1.6 at z~3, and that the evolution of the number density of\nlow-mass (10^9-10^10 Msun) galaxies is weaker than that of M* (~10^11 Msun)\ngalaxies. This indicates that the contribution of low-mass galaxies to the\ntotal stellar mass density has been significant at high redshift. The\nsteepening of the low-mass slope with redshift is opposite trend expected from\nthe stellar mass dependence of the specific star formation rate reported in\nprevious studies. The present result suggests that the hierarchical merging\nprocess overwhelmed the effect of the stellar mass growth by star formation and\nwas very important for the stellar mass assembly of these galaxies at 1<~z<~3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2009 12:27:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-28"}

Bistable molecules, with\ne.g. two stable cis and trans isomeric configurations, could provide, once\nclamped between two electrodes, a switching phenomenon in the nonequilibrium\ncurrent response. Here, we model molecular switch junctions formed at silicon\ncontacts and demonstrate the potential of tunable molecular switches in\nelectrode/molecule/electrode configurations. Using the non equilibrium Green\nfunction approach implemented with the density-functional-based tight-binding\ntheory, a series of properties such as electron transmissions, I-V\ncharacteristics in the different isomer-conformations, and potential energy\nsurfaces as a function of the reaction coordinates along the trans to cis\ntransition were calculated. Furthermore, in order to investigate stability of\nmolecular switches in ambient conditions, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations\nat room temperature were performed and time- dependent fluctuations of the\nconductance along the MD pathways were calculated. Our numerical results show\nthat the transmission spectra of the cis isomers are more conductive than trans\ncounterparts inside the bias window for all two model molecules. The\ncurrent-voltage characteristics consequently show the same trends.\nAdditionally, the calculations of time-dependent transmission fluctuations\nalong the MD pathways have shown that the transmission in cis isomers is always\nsignificantly larger than that of trans counterparts showing that molecular\nswitches can be expected to work as robust molecular switching components.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2009 14:00:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-02"}

Along these sightlines we previously detected weak CaII and\nNaI absorbers in their optical spectra.\n  The analysis of the high-resolution HI data reveals the presence of several\ncompact and cold clumps of neutral gas at velocities similar to the optical\nabsorption. The clumps have narrow HI line widths in the range of 1.8 to 13\nkm/s, yielding upper limits for the kinetic temperature of the gas of 70 to\n3700 K. The neutral gas has low HI column densities in the range of 5E18 to\n3E19 1/cm^2. All clumps have angular sizes of only a few arcminutes.\n  Our high-resolution 21-cm observations indicate that many of the CaII and NaI\nabsorbers seen in our optical quasar spectra are associated with low-column\ndensity HI clumps at small angular scales. This suggests that next to the\nmassive, high-column density neutral gas clouds in the halo (the common 21-cm\nLVCs, IVCs, and HVCs) there exists a population of low-mass, neutral gas\nstructures in the halo that remain mostly unseen in the existing 21-cm all-sky\nsurveys of IVCs and HVCs.

AIMS: This paper presents\nthe first intrinsic examination of stellar spectra from the RAVE survey, aimed\nat evaluating their diagnostic potential for peculiar stars and at contributing\nto the general understanding of Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs). METHODS: We\nused the multi-epoch spectra for all seven LBVs observed, between 2005 and\n2008, in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) by the RAVE survey. RESULTS: We\ndemonstrate that RAVE spectra possess significant diagnostic potential when\napplied to peculiar stars and, in particular, LBVs. The behaviour of the radial\nvelocities for both emission and absorption lines, and the spectral changes\nbetween outburst and quiescence states are described and found to agree with\nevidence gathered at more conventional wavelengths. The wind outflow signatures\nand their variability are investigated, with multi-components detected in S\nDoradus. Photoionisation modelling of the rich emission line spectrum of R 127\nshows evidence of a massive detached ionised shell that was ejected during the\n1982-2000 outburst. Surface inhomogeneities in the nuclear-processed material,\nbrought to the surface by heavy mass loss, could have been observed in S\nDoradus, even if alternative explanations are possible. We also detect the\ntransition from quiescence to outburst state in R 71. Finally, our spectrum of\nR 84 offers one of the clearest views of its cool companion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2009 15:19:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

For this reason the actual\nformalism of QFT is partly based on a suitable generalization of the one\nalready used for systems of point particles. This circumstance gives rise to a\nnumber of conceptual problems, stemming essentially from the fact that the\nexistence within QFT of non-equivalent representations implies the existence of\nfield theories allowing, within the same theory, different, inequivalent,\ndescriptions of particles. This led some authors to claim that in QFT the\nconcept itself of particle should be abandoned. In this paper we will shortly\ndiscuss the validity of this claim, as well as the possibilities, so far\nexisting, of building alternative versions of QFT, not designed in advance to\nallow some kind of particle representation. We will also spend some words about\nthe generalizations of the concept itself of particle which could grant for a\nbetter cohabitation of particles and fields within a wider formulation of QFT.\nThe latter is indispensable if we want to extend the range of application of\nQFT from particle physics or simple condensed matter physics to other domains\nof scientific research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2009 15:12:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-02"}

It is demonstrated, in\nparticular, that in the ultra-relativistic approximation matter-scaling and\nscalar field-dominated solutions always arise. In the first scenario the empty\nuniverse is the past attractor, while in the second model the past attractor is\nthe matter-dominated phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2009 15:50:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2009 21:13:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2009 20:15:01 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 22 Dec 2010 17:10:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-23"}

This study addresses the current endeavor to the development of\nefficient crystals for the realization of a Laue lens.\n  In the theoretical part 35 candidate-crystals both pure and two-components\nare considered. Their peak reflectivity at 100 keV, 500 keV and 1 MeV is\ncalculated assuming they are mosaic crystals. It results that a careful\nselection of crystals can allow a reflectivity above 30% over the whole energy\nrange, and even reaching 40% in its lower part. Experimentally, we concentrated\non three different materials (Si_{1-x}Ge_x with gradient of composition, mosaic\nCu and Au) that have been measured both at ESRF and ILL using\nhighly-monochromatic beams ranging from 300 keV up to 816 keV. The aim was to\ncheck their homogeneity, quality and angular spread (mosaicity). These crystals\nhave shown outstanding performance such as reflectivity up to 31% at ~600 keV\n(Au) or 60% at 300 keV (SiGe) and angular spread as low as 15 arcsec for Cu,\nfulfilling very well the requirements for a Laue lens application.\nUnexpectedly, we also noticed important discrepancies with Darwin's model when\na crystal is measured using various energies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2009 15:31:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-03"}

We\nemploy this technique to measure the ratio of off-resonant light shifts (or\nac-Stark effect) in these states to a precision of 10^{-3} at two different\nwavelengths. These results constitute a new high precision test of heavy-atom\natomic theory. Such experimental tests in Ba+ are in high demand since\nknowledge of key dipole matrix elements is currently limited to about 5%.
