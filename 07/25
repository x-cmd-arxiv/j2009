We fit physical dust models to a\ncombination of BLAST observations and other available data for the galaxies\nobserved by Spitzer. We fit a modified blackbody to the remaining galaxies to\nobtain total dust mass and mean dust temperature. For the four galaxies with\nSpitzer data, we also produce maps and radial profiles of dust column density\nand temperature. We measure the fraction of BLAST detected flux originating\nfrom the central cores of these galaxies and use this to calculate a \"core\nfraction,\" an upper limit on the \"AGN fraction\" of these galaxies. We also find\nour resolved observations of these galaxies give a dust mass estimate 5-19\ntimes larger than an unresolved observations would predict. Finally, we are\nable to use these data to derive a value for the dust mass absorption\nco-efficient of kappa = 0.29 +/-0.03 m^2 kg^-1 at 250 microns.

The basic assumption is that there is an\nirreducible uncertainty in the location of particles: positions constitute a\nconfiguration space and the corresponding probability distributions constitute\na statistical manifold. The dynamics follows from a principle of inference, the\nmethod of Maximum Entropy. The concept of time is introduced as a convenient\nway to keep track of change. A welcome feature is that the entropic dynamics\nnotion of time incorporates a natural distinction between past and future. The\nstatistical manifold is assumed to be a dynamical entity: its curved and\nevolving geometry determines the evolution of the particles which, in their\nturn, react back and determine the evolution of the geometry. Imposing that the\ndynamics conserve energy leads to the Schroedinger equation and to a natural\nexplanation of its linearity, its unitarity, and of the role of complex\nnumbers. The phase of the wave function is explained as a feature of purely\nstatistical origin.

First,\nwe introduce a grammar-guided feature extraction system, enabling the\nexploration of a richer feature space while constraining the features to a\nuseful subset. This is specified with a rule-based generative grammar crafted\nby a human expert. Second, we learn a classifier on this data using a newly\nproposed variant of AdaBoost which takes into account the spatially correlated\nnature of the data.

Major strengths of this approach are: (1) a\nway of randomly searching a broad feature space, (2) its performance when\nevaluated on well-matched evaluation criteria, and (3) its use of the location\nprediction domain to learn object detectors as well as to generate detections\nthat perform well on several tasks: object counting, tracking, and target\ndetection.

However, some\ncoalitional games have empty cores, and any outcome in such a game is unstable.\n  In this paper, we investigate the possibility of stabilizing a coalitional\ngame by using external payments. We consider a scenario where an external\nparty, which is interested in having the players work together, offers a\nsupplemental payment to the grand coalition (or, more generally, a particular\ncoalition structure). This payment is conditional on players not deviating from\ntheir coalition(s). The sum of this payment plus the actual gains of the\ncoalition(s) may then be divided among the agents so as to promote stability.\nWe define the \\emph{cost of stability (CoS)} as the minimal external payment\nthat stabilizes the game.\n  We provide general bounds on the cost of stability in several classes of\ngames, and explore its algorithmic properties. To develop a better intuition\nfor the concepts we introduce, we provide a detailed algorithmic study of the\ncost of stability in weighted voting games, a simple but expressive class of\ngames which can model decision-making in political bodies, and cooperation in\nmultiagent settings. Finally, we extend our model and results to games with\ncoalition structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 2009 21:38:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-21"}

CO+ is more likely to be\ndestroyed than excited in collisions with hydrogen. An anomalous excitation\nmechanism may thus have to be considered when interpreting CO^+ observations.\nChemical models are used to perform a parameter study of CO^+ abundances. Line\nfluxes are calculated for N(CO+)=10^12 cm^-2 and different gas densities and\ntemperatures using a non-LTE escape probability method. The chemical formation\nand destruction rates are considered explicitly in the detailed balance\nequations of the radiative transfer. In addition, the rotational levels of CO+\nare assumed to be excited upon chemical formation according to a formation\ntemperature. It is found, that chemical models are generally able to produce\nhigh fractional CO+ abundances (x(CO+) =10^-10). In a far-ultraviolet (FUV)\ndominated environment, however, high abundances of CO+ are only produced in\nregions with a Habing field G0 > 100 and T(kin) > 600 K, posing a strong\nconstraint on the gas temperature.
