These\nwell-motivated scenarios for inflation in string theory have monomial\npotentials over super-Planckian field ranges, with superimposed sinusoidal\nmodulations from instanton effects. Such periodic modulations of the potential\ncan drive resonant enhancements of the correlation functions of cosmological\nperturbations, with characteristic modulations of the amplitude as a function\nof wavenumber. We give an analytical result for the scalar power spectrum in\nthis class of models, and we determine the limits that present data places on\nthe amplitude and frequency of modulations. Then, incorporating an improved\nunderstanding of the realization of axion monodromy inflation in string theory,\nwe perform a careful study of microphysical constraints in this scenario. We\nfind that detectable modulations of the scalar power spectrum are commonplace\nin well-controlled examples, while resonant contributions to the bispectrum are\nundetectable in some classes of examples and detectable in others. We conclude\nthat resonant contributions to the spectrum and bispectrum are a characteristic\nsignature of axion monodromy inflation that, in favorable cases, could be\ndetected in near-future experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2009 19:33:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

This indicates that the large order of perturbative\nseries and the non-perturbative contributions should have unexpected features.\nUsing the large-N limit of 2-dimensional nonlinear O(N) sigma model, we discuss\nthe complex singularities of the average energy for complex 't Hooft coupling\nlambda= g_0^2N.

In an orthogonal way, several\ndistributed systems have been termed in literature as being realizations of\ngames in the sense of game theory. In this paper, we investigate under which\nconditions population protocols, or more generally pairwise interaction rules,\ncan be considered as the result of a symmetric game. We prove that not all\nrules can be considered as symmetric games.% We prove that some basic protocols\ncan be realized using symmetric games. As a side effect of our study, we also\nprove that any population protocol can be simulated by a symmetric one (but not\nnecessarily a game).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2009 18:06:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-20"}

Several geometries have been considered: a linear array of rings\nconnected with short or long wires compared to the phase coherence length,\nsquare networks and hollow cylinders. Compared to the well-known case of the\nisolated ring, we show that for connected rings, the winding of the Brownian\ntrajectories around the rings is modified, leading to a different harmonics\ncontent of the quantum oscillations. We relate this harmonics content to the\ndistribution of winding numbers. We consider the limits where coherence length\n$L_\\varphi$ is small or large compared to the perimeter $L$ of each ring\nconstituting the network. In the latter case, the coherent diffusive\ntrajectories explore a region larger than $L$, whence a network dependent\nharmonics content. Our analysis is based on the calculation of the spectral\ndeterminant of the diffusion equation for which we have a simple expression on\nany network.

The classical Knuth-Morris-Pratt\nalgorithm [SIAM J. Comput., 1977] solves the string matching problem in linear\ntime which is optimal if we can only read one character at the time. However,\nmost strings are stored in a computer in a packed representation with several\ncharacters in a single word, giving us the opportunity to read multiple\ncharacters simultaneously. In this paper we study the worst-case complexity of\nstring matching on strings given in packed representation. Let $m \\leq n$ be\nthe lengths $P$ and $Q$, respectively, and let $\\sigma$ denote the size of the\nalphabet. On a standard unit-cost word-RAM with logarithmic word size we\npresent an algorithm using time $$ O\\left(\\frac{n}{\\log_\\sigma n} + m +\n\\occ\\right). $$ Here $\\occ$ is the number of occurrences of $P$ in $Q$. For $m\n= o(n)$ this improves the $O(n)$ bound of the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm.\nFurthermore, if $m = O(n/\\log_\\sigma n)$ our algorithm is optimal since any\nalgorithm must spend at least $\\Omega(\\frac{(n+m)\\log\n  \\sigma}{\\log n} + \\occ) = \\Omega(\\frac{n}{\\log_\\sigma n} + \\occ)$ time to\nread the input and report all occurrences.

In this paper we use the\nJeans equation to argue that (1) and (2) cannot both be true at all radii. We\nexamine the implied radial dependence of rho/sigma3 over 12 orders of magnitude\nin radius by solving the Jeans equation for a broad range of input rho and\nvelocity anisotropy beta. Independent of beta, we find that rho/sigma3 is\napproximately a power law only over the limited range of halo radius resolvable\nby current simulations (down to ~0.1% of the virial radius), and rho/sigma3\ndeviates significantly from a power-law below this scale for both the Einasto\nand NFW rho.

We discuss the implications of these results with regards\nto the conditions/locations that may favour the escape of individual cluster\nwinds. Our findings imply that the starburst environment is highly fragmented\ninto a range of clouds from small/dense clumps with low filling factors (<1pc,\nn_e>10^4 cm-3) to larger filling factor, less dense gas. The near-constant\nstate of the ionization state of the ~10^4 K gas throughout the starburst can\nbe explained as a consequence of the small cloud sizes, which allow the gas\nconditions to respond quickly to any changes. We have examined in more detail\nboth the broad (FWHM 150-350 km/s) line component found in Paper I that we\nassociated with emission from turbulent mixing layers on the gas clouds, and\nthe discrete outflow channel identified within the inner wind.

In different regions of\nthe parameter space (the dipole moment and atom number), matter-wave solitons\nfeature flat-top or compacton-like shapes. For the flat-top states, the NLSE\nwith the local cubic-quintic (CQ) nonlinearity is shown to be a good\napproximation. Specific dynamical effects are studied assuming that the\nstrength of the DD interactions is ramped up or drops to zero. Generation of\ndark-soliton pairs in the gas shrinking under the action of the intensifying DD\nattraction is observed. Dark solitons exhibit the particle-like collision\nbehavior. Peculiarities of dipole solitons in the TG gas are highlighted by\ncomparison with the NLSE including the local CQ terms. Collisions between the\nsolitons are studied too. In many cases, the collisions result in merger of the\nsolitons into a breather, due to strong attraction between them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jul 2009 01:19:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-13"}

In\nthis scenario, a shock-triggered thermonuclear explosion ensues from the\ncollision of two white dwarfs. Consistent modeling of the gas dynamics together\nwith nuclear reactions using both a smoothed particle and a grid-based\nhydrodynamics code are performed to study the viability of this alternative\nprogenitor channel.

Once the inter-genre\nsimilarity is modelled, elimination of the inter-genre similarity reduces the\ninter-genre confusion and improves the identification rates. Inter-genre\nsimilarity modelling is further improved with iterative IGS modelling(IIGS) and\nscore modelling for IGS elimination(SMIGS). Experimental results with promising\nclassification improvements are provided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jul 2009 13:25:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-18"}

The initial disk mass and angular momentum set the viscous\ntimescale. An efficient torque, with (1 - w^2) dependence on the fastness\nparameter w leads to period clustering in the observed AXP-SGR period range\nunder a wide range of initial conditions. The timescale t_0 for the early\nevolution of the fallback disk, and the final stages of fallback disk\nevolution, when the disk becomes passive, are the crucial determinants of the\nevolution. The disk becomes passive at temperatures around 100 K, which\nprovides a natural cutoff for the X-ray luminosity and defines the end of\nevolution in the observable AXP and SGR phase. This low value for the minimum\ntemperature for active disk turbulence indicates that the fallback disks are\nactive up to a large radius greater than ~10^{12} cm. We find that transient\nAXPs and SGRs are likely to be older than their persistent cousins. A fallback\ndisk with mass transfer rates corresponding to the low quiescent X-ray\nluminosities of the transient sources in early evolutionary phases would have a\nrelatively lower initial mass, such that the mass-flow rate in the disk is not\nsufficient for the inner disk to penetrate into the light cylinder of the young\nneutron star, making mass accretion onto the neutron star impossible. The\ntransient AXP phase therefore must start later. The model results imply that\nthe transient AXP/SGRs, although older, are likely to be similar in number to\npersistent sources (abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jul 2009 14:49:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

With a much\nlarger data set than previously analyzed (all archival data from February 1996\nup to October 2007), we first investigate the reality of the 1330 Hz QPO\nreported by van Straaten et al. (2000). This QPO would be of particular\ninterest since it has the highest frequency reported for any source. A thorough\nanalysis of the same observation fails to confirm the detection. On the other\nhand, over our extended data set, the highest QPO frequency we measure for the\nupper kHz QPO is at about 1224 Hz; a value which is fully consistent with the\nmaximum values observed in similar systems. Second, we demonstrate that the\nfrequency dependence of the quality factor and amplitude of the lower and upper\nkHz QPOs follow the systematic trends seen in similar systems (Barret et al.,\n2006). In particular, 4U0614+09 shows a drop of the quality factor of the lower\nkHz QPO above 700 Hz. If this is due to an approach to the innermost stable\ncircular orbit, it implies a neutron star mass of about 1.9 solar masses.\nFinally, when analyzing the data over fixed durations, we have found a gap in\nthe frequency distribution of the upper QPO, associated with a local minimum of\nits amplitude. A similar gap is not present in the distribution of the lower\nQPO frequencies, suggesting some cautions when interpreting frequency ratio\ndistributions, based on the occurrence of the lower QPO only.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jul 2009 15:04:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}
