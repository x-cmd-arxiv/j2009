The creep rate is suppressed at high temperatures and at fields\nbelow the matching field, indicating the columnar defects are efficient pinning\nsites at these H and T conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2009 18:28:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

In a not necesserily planar cross sectional area\nthrough a vortex tangle, taken locally orthogonal through each individual tube,\nthe dipoles are moving with the classical dipole velocity. The vortex radius is\ndirectly related with Prandtl's classical mixing length. The quasi-particles\nperform dipol chaos which reminds of molecular chaos in real gases.

This work considers the effects that\nelectrostatic and magnetic forces, alone or in combination, can have on the\ncoagulation of dust in various environments. A numerical model is used to\nsimulate the coagulation of charged, charged-magnetic and magnetic dust\naggregates formed from ferrous material and the results are compared to each\nother as well as to those from uncharged, non-magnetic material. The\ninteractions between extended dust aggregates are also examined, specifically\nlooking at how the arrangement of charge over the aggregate surface or the\ninclusion of magnetic material produces dipole-dipole interactions. It will be\nshown that these dipole-dipole interactions can affect the orientation and\nstructural formation of aggregates as they collide and stick. Analysis of the\nresulting dust populations will also demonstrate the impact that grain\ncomposition and/or charge can have on the structure of the aggregate as\ncharacterized by the resulting fractal dimension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2009 21:02:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-03"}

The model depends\non the relative importance of gravitational, turbulent, magnetic, and thermal\nenergies, expressed through the virial parameter, alpha_vir, the rms sonic Mach\nnumber, M_S,0, and the ratio of mean gas pressure to mean magnetic pressure,\nbeta_0. The SFR is predicted to decrease with increasing alpha_vir (stronger\nturbulence relative to gravity), to increase with increasing M_S,0 (for\nconstant values of alpha_vir), and to depend weakly on beta_0 for values\ntypical of star forming regions (M_S,0 ~ 4-20 and beta_0 ~ 1-20). In the\nunrealistic limit of beta_0 -> infinity, that is in the complete absence of a\nmagnetic field, the SFR increases approximately by a factor of three, which\nshows the importance of magnetic fields in the star formation process, even\nwhen they are relatively weak (super-Alfvenic turbulence).

The baby\nskyrmion configuration was constructed from two Q=1 hedgehog solutions to the\nnew baby Skyrme model in $(2+1)$ dimensions.\n  The potential obstructions were created by introducing a new term into the\nLagrangian which resulted in a localised inhomogeneity in the potential term's\ncoefficient. In the barrier system the normal circular path was deformed as the\nskyrmions traversed the barrier, after which the skyrmions orbited the boundary\nof the system. For critical values of the barrier height and width the\nskyrmions were no longer bound although the unbound behaviour is not clearly\ndistinct from the bound. In the case of a potential hole the dynamics of baby\nskyrmions is dependent upon the binding energy of the system. Depending upon\nits value, the skyrmions' behaviour varies. The angular momentum must be\nmodified to ensure overall conservation. We show that there exists a link\nbetween the oscillation in the skyrmion's energy density and the periods of\nnon-conservation of the angular momentum in Landau-Lifshitz models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2009 09:51:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-03"}

An attempt is made to define space-time not via the concept of\nmanifold, but via the store of physical functions defined on it. The new\ndescription is based on the commutator representation of the causal structure\nof operator field theory. It is not the world point, but a universal field\nsupermatrix complex U that is assumed to be the carrier of possible local\nevents. This complex involves a complete set of Heisenberg local field\noperators together with their spin-group bases in the Fermi-field\nrepresentation. The fundamental element of the extension is described in the\nmodel by the equation of a special commutator algebra closed on two such local\ncomplexes U_1 and U_2 \"nearest\" in the two-sided light-like connection and\nlinked by a single virtual field interaction vertex. The discrete character of\nthe constructed \"quantum proximity\" equation containing the gravitational\nconstant is associated with the existence of local curvature on the Planck\nscale. Algebraic closed-ness of the basic equation suggests that the charge\nsymmetry group should be group E_6 with non-standard representations of the\nfermion and scalar fields. On the basis of the calculated U expression we\npropose an effective superinvariant Lagrangian with fixed coefficients on the\nnear-Planck scale, from which one can in principle try to obtain a low-energy\nlimit for comparison with the real world.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2009 11:42:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-03"}

This presentation follows the outline given by Criminale and Drazin\n[Stud. in Applied Math. \\textbf{83}, 123 (1990)] that describes the system in\nterms of perturbation vorticity and velocity. The analysis is based on large\nscale waves and expansions using multi scales and multi times for the partial\ndifferential equations. The multiscaling is based on an approach where the\nsmall parameter is linked to the perturbation property independently from the\nflow control parameter. Solutions of the perturbative equations are determined\nnumerically after the introduction of a regular perturbation scheme\nanalytically deduced up to the second order. Numerically, the complete linear\nsystem is also integrated. Since the results relevant to the complete problem\nare in very good agreement with the results of the first order analysis, the\nnumerical solution at the second order was deemed not necessary.

We observe a\nsign change of the thermal expansion for the different ground states, and at\nthe quantum critical point $H_c$ the low-temperature expansion approaches a\n$1/\\sqrt{T}$ divergence. Thus, our data agree very well with the expected\nquantum critical behaviour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2009 14:53:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-16"}

Their significance is mainly\ndue to the fact that they correspond to $n \\times n$ alternating sign matrices\nwhen prescribing $(1,2,...,n)$ as bottom row of the array. We define monotone\n$(d,m)$--trapezoids as monotone triangles with $m$ rows where the $d-1$ top\nrows are removed. (These objects are also equivalent to certain partial\nalternating sign matrices.) It is known that the number of monotone triangles\nwith bottom row $(k_1,...,k_n)$ is given by a polynomial\n$\\alpha(n;k_1,...,k_n)$ in the $k_i$'s. The main purpose of this paper is to\nshow that the number of monotone $(d,m)$--trapezoids with prescribed top and\nbottom row appears as a coefficient in the expansion of a specialization of\n$\\alpha(n;k_1,...,k_n)$ with respect to a certain polynomial basis. This\nsettles a generalization of a recent conjecture of Romik and the author. Among\nother things, the result is used to express the number of monotone triangles\nwith bottom row $(1,2,...,i-1,i+1,...,j-1,j+1,...,n)$ (which is, by the\nstandard bijection, also the number of $n \\times n$ alternating sign matrices\nwith given top two rows) in terms of the number of $n \\times n$ alternating\nsign matrices with prescribed top and bottom row, and, by a formula of\nStroganov for the latter numbers, to provide an explicit formula for the first\nnumbers. (A formula of this type was first derived by Karklinsky and Romik\nusing the relation of alternating sign matrices to the six--vertex model.)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2009 15:06:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-03"}
