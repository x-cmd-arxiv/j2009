Submillimeter Array observations combined with IRAM 30 meter data in\n12CO(2--1) reveal the outflow orientation in the IRDC 18223-3 region, and PdBI\n3 mm observations confirm this orientation in other molecular species. The\nimplication of the outflow's presence is that an accretion disk is feeding it,\nso using high density tracers such as C18O, N2H+, and CH3OH, we looked for\nindications of a velocity gradient perpendicular to the outflow direction.\nSurprisingly, this gradient turns out to be most apparent in CH3OH. The large\nsize (28,000 AU) of the flattened rotating object detected indicates that this\nvelocity gradient cannot be due solely to a disk, but rather from inward\nspiraling gas within which a Keplerian disk likely exists. From the outflow\nparameters, we derive properties of the source such as an outflow dynamical age\nof ~37,000 years, outflow mass of ~13 M_sun, and outflow energy of ~1.7 x 10^46\nerg. While the outflow mass and energy are clearly consistent with a high-mass\nstar forming region, the outflow dynamical age indicates a slightly more\nevolved evolutionary stage than previous spectral energy distribution (SED)\nmodeling indicates. The calculated outflow properties reveal that this is truly\na massive star in the making. We also present a model of the observed methanol\nvelocity gradient. The rotational signatures can be modeled via rotationally\ninfalling gas. These data present evidence for one of the youngest known\noutflow/infall/disk systems in massive star formation. A tentative evolutionary\npicture for massive disks is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2009 19:03:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Neutrinos from 18Ne and 6He with Lorentz boost gamma=350 are\ndetected in a 500 kton water Cerenkov detector at a distance L=650 km (first\noscillation peak) from the source. Neutrinos from 8B and 8Li are detected in a\n50 kton magnetized iron detector at a distance L=7000 km (magic baseline) from\nthe source. Since the decay ring requires a tilt angle of 34.5 degrees to send\nthe beam to the magic baseline, the far end of the ring has a maximum depth of\nd=2132 m for magnetic field strength of 8.3 T, if one demands that the fraction\nof ions that decay along the straight sections of the racetrack geometry decay\nring (called livetime) is 0.3. We alleviate this problem by proposing to trade\nreduction of the livetime of the decay ring with the increase in the boost\nfactor of the ions, such that the number of events at the detector remains\nalmost the same. This allows to substantially reduce the maximum depth of the\ndecay ring at the far end, without significantly compromising the sensitivity\nof the experiment to the oscillation parameters. We take 8B and 8Li with\ngamma=390 and 656 respectively, as these are the largest possible boost factors\npossible with the envisaged upgrades of the SPS at CERN. This allows us to\nreduce d of the decay ring by a factor of 1.7 for 8.3 T magnetic field.\nIncrease of magnetic field to 15 T would further reduce d to 738 m only.

These\nfluids occur in diverse natural and synthetic forms and can be regarded as the\nrule rather than the exception. They show very complex strain and time\ndependent behavior and may have initial yield-stress. Their common feature is\nthat they do not obey the simple Newtonian relation of proportionality between\nstress and rate of deformation. Non-Newtonian fluids are generally classified\ninto three main categories: time-independent whose strain rate solely depends\non the instantaneous stress, time-dependent whose strain rate is a function of\nboth magnitude and duration of the applied stress and viscoelastic which shows\npartial elastic recovery on removal of the deforming stress and usually\ndemonstrates both time and strain dependency. In this article the key aspects\nof these fluids are reviewed with particular emphasis on single-phase flow\nthrough porous media. The four main approaches for describing the flow in\nporous media are examined and assessed. These are: continuum models, bundle of\ntubes models, numerical methods and pore-scale network modeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2009 16:27:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-20"}

The HVC complex has a multiphase structure with\na neutral (OI, FeII), weakly ionized (FeII, NII), and highly ionized (OVI)\ncomponents, and has evidence of dust but no molecules. All the observed\nproperties of the HVC can be explained by an energetic outflow from the LMC.\nThis is the first example of a large (>10^6 M_sun) HVC complex that is linked\nto stellar feedback occurring in a dwarf spiral galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2009 17:49:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-24"}

In this work, we use event-driven molecular dynamics, combined with an\noptimized parallel tempering scheme, to study this polymer model over a wide\nrange of parameters. We examine the conditions where the helix structure is\nstable and determine how the interaction parameters of the polymer govern the\ndetails of the helix structure. The width of the square well (proportional to\nlambda) is found to control the radius of the helix, which decreases with\nincreasing well width until the polymer forms a coiled sphere for sufficiently\nlarge wells. The helices are found to be stable for only a window of molecular\nweights. If the polymer is too short, the helix will not form. If the polymer\nis too long, the helix is no longer the minimum energy structure, and other\nfolded structures will form. The size of this window is governed by the chain\nstiffness, which in this model is a function of the ratio of the monomer size\nto the bond length. Outside this window, the polymer still freezes into a\nlocked structure at low temperature, however, unless the chain is sufficiently\nstiff, this structure will not be unique and is similar to a glassy state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2009 19:07:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-30"}

Our assumptions\nare motivated by the remark that these categories often contain non-full tensor\nC*-subcategories with conjugates and the same objects admitting an embedding\ninto the Hilbert spaces. Such an embedding defines a compact quantum group by\nWoronowicz duality. An important example is the Temperley--Lieb category\ncanonically contained in a tensor C*-category generated by a single real or\npseudoreal object of dimension bigger than 2. The associated quantum groups are\nthe universal orthogonal quantum groups of Wang and Van Daele. Our main result\nasserts that there is a full and faithful tensor functor from M to a category\nof Hilbert bimodule representations of the compact quantum group.

Perhaps the most disturbing is the fact that when a spacecraft on a flyby\ntrajectory approaches the Earth within 2000 km or less, it often experiences a\nchange in total orbital energy per unit mass. Next, a secular change in the\nastronomical unit AU is definitely a concern. It is increasing by about 15 cm\nyr$^{-1}$. The other two anomalies are perhaps less disturbing because of known\nsources of nongravitational acceleration. The first is an apparent slowing of\nthe two Pioneer spacecraft as they exit the solar system in opposite\ndirections. Some astronomers and physicists are convinced this effect is of\nconcern, but many others are convinced it is produced by a nearly identical\nthermal emission from both spacecraft, in a direction away from the Sun,\nthereby producing acceleration toward the Sun. The fourth anomaly is a measured\nincrease in the eccentricity of the Moon's orbit. Here again, an increase is\nexpected from tidal friction in both the Earth and Moon. However, there is a\nreported unexplained increase that is significant at the three-sigma level. It\nis prudent to suspect that all four anomalies have mundane explanations, or\nthat one or more anomalies are a result of systematic error. Yet they might\neventually be explained by new physics.

If mind does not act on matter is mind a\nmere epiphenomenon? 3. What might be the source of free will? 4. What might be\nthe source of a responsible free will? 5. Why might it have been selectively\nadvantageous to evolve consciousness? 6. What is consciousness? I approach the\nfirst five of the above six problems based on two physical postulates. First\nthe mind-brain system is a quantum coherent, but reversibly decohering and\nrecohering system. This allows me to answer 1) above, mind does not act\ncausally on brain at all, rather it acausally decohers to classicity (for all\npractical purposes), hence has consequences for brain and body as matter.\nEpiphenomenalism is averted. A quantum mind, because it is acausal on\nCopenhagen including Born, yields a free will, but a merely random free will,\nnot a responsible free will. Second, the most radical part of this article\nproposes that the quantum classical interface is not always describable by a\nlaw: specifically in a special relativity setting, no function, F, maps the\npresent state of the system mind-brain into its future. In its place is a\nnonrandom yet lawless process. I seek in this non-random yet lawless process a\nsource for a responsible free will. Finally, if the quantum-classical boundary\ncan be non-random yet lawless, then no algorithmic simulation of the world or\nourselves can calculate the real world, hence the evolutionary selective\nadvantages for evolving consciousness to know it may be great. I make no\nprogress on problem 6, the hard problem of qualia.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2009 05:39:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-16"}

Studies of extragalactic GC systems\nusing deep, high-quality imaging have revealed a small but significant slope to\nthe color-magnitude relation for metal-poor GCs in a number of galaxies. We\npresent a study of the M87 GC system using deep, archival HST/ACS imaging with\nthe F606W and F814W filters, in which we find a significant color-magnitude\nrelation for the metal-poor GCs. The slope of this relation in the I vs. V-I\ncolor-magnitude diagram ($\\gamma_I=-0.024\\pm0.006$) is perfectly consistent\nwith expectations based on previously published results using data from the ACS\nVirgo Cluster Survey. The relation is driven by the most luminous GCs, those\nwith $M_I<-10$, and its significance is largest when fitting metal-poor GCs\nbrighter than $M_I=-7.8$, a luminosity which is ~1 mag fainter than our fitted\nGaussian mean for the luminosity function (LF) of blue, metal-poor GCs (~0.8\nmag fainter than the mean for all GCs). These results indicate that there is a\nmass scale at which the correlation begins, and is consistent with a scenario\nwhere self-enrichment drives a mass-metallicity relationship. We show that\npreviously measured half-light radii of M87 GCs from best-fit PSF-convolved\nKing models are consistent with the more accurate measurements in this study,\nand we also explain how the color-magnitude relation for metal-poor GCs is real\nand cannot be an artifact of the photometry.

More interestingly,\nwith larger axial strains (before buckling), the axial strain induced torsion\n(a-SIT) shows asymmetric behaviors for axial tensile and compressing strains,\nwhich suggests anharmonic elasticity of SWNTs plays an important role in real\na-SIT responses. In order to study the a-SIT of chiral SWNTs with actual sizes,\nand avoid possible deviations of computer simulation results due to the\nfinite-size effect, we propose a 2D analytical continuum model which can be\nused to describe the the SWNTs of arbitrary chiralities, curvatures, and\nlengths, with the concerning of anisotropic and anharmonic elasticity of SWNTs.\nThis elastic energy of present model comes from the continuum limit of lattice\nenergy based on Second Generation Reactive Empirical Bond Order potential\n(REBO-II), a well-established empirical potential for solid carbons.

The X-ray spectra are from the Chandra\nand XMM-Newton archives. We apply correlation and partial-correlation analyses\nto the equivalent widths, continuum monochromatic luminosities, and alpha_ox,\nwhich characterizes the relative X-ray to UV brightness. The equivalent width\nof the CIV 1549 emission line is correlated with both alpha_ox and luminosity.\nWe find that by regressing l_UV with EW(CIV) and alpha_ox, we can obtain\ntighter correlations than by regressing l_UV with only EW(CIV). Both\ncorrelation and regression analyses imply that l_UV is not the only factor\ncontrolling the changes of EW(CIV); alpha_ox (or, equivalently, the soft X-ray\nemission) plays a fundamental role in the formation and variation of CIV.\nVariability contributes at least 60% of the scatter of the EW(CIV)-l_UV\nrelation and at least 75% of the scatter of the of the EW(CIV)-alpha_ox\nrelation.\n  In our sample, narrow Fe Kalpha 6.4 keV emission lines are detected in 50\nobjects. Although narrow Fe Kalpha exhibits a BEff similar to that of CIV, its\nequivalent width has almost no dependence on either alpha_ox or EW(CIV). This\nsuggests that the majority of narrow Fe Kalpha emission is unlikely to be\nproduced in the broad emission-line region. We do find suggestive correlations\nbetween the emission-line luminosities of CIV and Fe Kalpha, which could be\npotentially used to estimate the detectability of the Fe Kalpha line of quasars\nfrom rest-frame UV spectroscopic observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2009 15:49:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

This paradox has been discussed intensively and seems to have been\nsolved in the comoving-like coordinates. However, to a real astrophysical\nobserver within a finite time, this problem should be discussed in the point of\nview of the distant rest-observer, which is the main purpose of this paper.\nFollowing the seminal work of Oppenheimer and Snyder (1939), we present the\nexact solution for one or two dust shells collapsing towards a pre-existing\nblack hole. We find that the metric of the inner region of the shell is\ntime-dependent and the clock inside the shell becomes slower as the shell\ncollapses towards the pre-existing black hole. This means the inner region of\nthe shell is influenced by the property of the shell, which is contrary to the\nresult in Newtonian theory. It does not contradict the Birkhoff's theorem,\nsince in our case we cannot arbitrarily select the clock inside the shell in\norder to ensure the continuity of the metric. This result in principle may be\ntested experimentally if a beam of light travels across the shell, which will\ntake a longer time than without the shell. It can be considered as the\ngeneralized Shapiro effect, because this effect is due to the mass outside, but\nnot inside as the case of the standard Shapiro effect. We also found that in\nreal astrophysical settings matter can indeed cross a black hole's horizon\naccording to the clock of an external observer and will not accumulate around\nthe event horizon of a black hole, i.e., no \"frozen star\" is formed for an\nexternal observer as matter falls towards a black hole.

This paper reviews the environment of three 10^7 Msun\nclusters near the inner Lindblad resonance of the barred spiral NGC 1365. The\nmorphology, mass, and flow of HI and CO gas in the spiral and barred regions\nare examined for evidence of the location and mechanism of cluster formation.\nThe accretion rate is compared with the star formation rate to infer the\nlifetime of the starburst. The gas appears to move from inside corotation in\nthe spiral region to looping filaments in the interbar region at a rate of ~6\nMsun/yr before impacting the bar dustlane somewhere along its length. The gas\nin this dustlane moves inward, growing in flux as a result of the accretion to\n~40 Msun/yr near the ILR. This inner rate exceeds the current nuclear star\nformation rate by a factor of 4, suggesting continued buildup of nuclear mass\nfor another ~0.5 Gyr. The bar may be only 1-2 Gyr old. Extrapolating the bar\nflow back in time, we infer that the clusters formed in the bar dustlane\noutside the central dust ring at a position where an interbar filament\ncurrently impacts the lane. The ram pressure from this impact is comparable to\nthe pressure in the bar dustlane, and both are comparable to the pressure in\nthe massive clusters. Impact triggering is suggested. The isothermal assumption\nin numerical simulations seems inappropriate for the rare fraction parts of\nspiral and bar gas flows.

A new approach\nto form a sub-millisecond pulsar (quark star) via accretion induced collapse\n(AIC) of a white dwarf is investigated here. Under this AIC process, we found\nthat: (1) almost all the newborn quark stars could have an initial spin period\nof $\\sim 0.1$ ms; (2) the nascent quark stars (even with a low mass) have\nsufficiently high spin-down luminosity and satisfy the conditions for pair\nproduction and sparking process to be as sub-millisecond radio pulsars; (3) in\nmost cases, the timescales of newborn quark stars in the phase of spin period\n$< 1$ (or $<0.5$) ms can be long enough to be detected.\n  As a comparison, an accretion spin-up process (for both neutron and quark\nstars) is also investigated. It is found that, quark stars formed through AIC\nprocess can have shorter periods ($\\leq$ 0.5 ms); while the periods of neutron\nstars formed in accretion spin-up process must be longer than 0.5ms. Thus if a\npulsar with a period less than 0.5 ms can be identified in the future, it\nshould be a quark star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2009 15:15:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-26"}

This\nis, qualitatively, similar to the flow generated at the slow resonance.

The\ncomputations prove that the way of ATP cleavage is governed by the electron\nspin of Mg. In the S state Mg prefers chelation of \\gamma-\\beta-phosphate\noxygens (O1-O2), whereas in the T state it chelates \\beta-\\alpha-phosphate\noxygens (O2-O3) or produces a single-bonded intermediate. Unlike the chelates,\nwhich initiate ionic reaction paths, the single-bonded intermediate starts off\na free-radical path of ATP cleavage, yielding a highly reactive\nadenosinemonophosphate ion-radical, .AMP-, earlier observed in the CIDNP\n(Chemically Induced Dynamic Nuclear Polarization) experiment (A.A. Tulub,\n2006). The free-radical path is highly sensitive to Mg nuclear spin, which\nthrough a hyperfine interaction favors the production of unpaired electron\nspins. The unique role of Mg in ATP cleavage comes through its ability to serve\nas a unique redox center, initially accepting an electron from ATP and then\ngiving it back to products. Redox activity of Mg differs for T and S states and\naffects the number of coordinated water molecules. The findings give a new\ninsight into the NTP (N = nucleoside) energetics and assembly of NTP-operating\nmolecules, including proteins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2009 15:55:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-16"}
