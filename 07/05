When a centrifugally-supported shock is present in the\ndisk, the concentrated particle acceleration occurring in the vicinity of the\nshock channels a significant fraction of the binding energy of the accreting\ngas into a population of relativistic particles. These high-energy particles\ndiffuse vertically through the disk and escape, carrying away both energy and\nentropy and allowing the remaining gas to accrete. The dynamical structure of\nthe disk/shock system is computed self-consistently using a model previously\ndeveloped by the authors that successfully accounts for the production of the\nobserved relativistic outflows (jets) in M87 and \\SgrA. This ensures that the\nrate at which energy is carried away from the disk by the escaping relativistic\nparticles is equal to the drop in the radial energy flux at the shock location,\nas required for energy conservation.

The dichotomies of\nSilver and Harrington-Kechris-Louveau show that with respect to Borel\nreducibility, any Borel equivalence relation strictly above equality on\n$\\omega$ is above equality on ${\\cal P}(\\omega)$, the power set of $\\omega$,\nand any Borel equivalence relation strictly above equality on the reals is\nabove equality modulo finite on ${\\cal P}(\\omega)$.

One possible\nexplanation for the widespread use of these models is that good techniques have\nbeen developed to extract appropriate training data for them from existing\ndocument/abstract and document/headline corpora. We believe that future\nprogress in automatic summarization will be driven both by the development of\nmore sophisticated, linguistically informed models, as well as a more effective\nleveraging of document/abstract corpora. In order to open the doors to\nsimultaneously achieving both of these goals, we have developed techniques for\nautomatically producing word-to-word and phrase-to-phrase alignments between\ndocuments and their human-written abstracts.

Low metallicities, large gas-to-star mass ratios, and blue colors\nof most low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies imply that these systems may be\nyounger than their high surface brightness counterparts. We seek to find\nobservational signatures that can help to constrain the age of blue LSB\ngalaxies. We use numerical hydrodynamic modelling to study the long-term (~13\nGyr) dynamical and chemical evolution of blue LSB galaxies adopting a sporadic\nscenario for star formation. Our models utilize various rates of star formation\nand different shapes of the initial mass function (IMF). We complement\nhydrodynamic modelling with population synthesis modelling to produce the\nintegrated B-V colors and Halpha equivalent widths (EW(Ha)). We find that the\nmean oxygen abundances, B-V colors, EW(Ha), and the radial fluctuations in the\noxygen abundance, when considered altogether, can be used to constrain the age\nof blue LSB galaxies if some independent knowledge of the IMF is available. Our\nmodelling strongly suggests the existence of a minimum age for blue LSB\ngalaxies. Model B-V colors and mean oxygen abundances set a tentative minimum\nage at 1.5-3.0 Gyr, whereas model EW(Ha) suggest a larger value of order 5-6\nGyr. The latter value may decrease somewhat, if blue LSB galaxies host IMFs\nwith a truncated upper mass limit.

Focusing on the head-on plunge, merger, and\nringdown of a BBH with transverse, antiparallel spins, we explore numerically\nthe momentum flow between the holes and the surrounding spacetime. We use the\nLandau-Lifshitz field-theory-in-flat-spacetime formulation of general\nrelativity to define and compute the density of field energy and field momentum\noutside horizons and the energy and momentum contained within horizons, and we\ndefine the effective velocity of each apparent and event horizon as the ratio\nof its enclosed momentum to its enclosed mass-energy. We find surprisingly good\nagreement between the horizons' effective and coordinate velocities. To\ninvestigate the gauge dependence of our results, we compare pseudospectral and\nmoving-puncture evolutions of physically similar initial data; although\nspectral and puncture simulations use different gauge conditions, we find\nremarkably good agreement for our results in these two cases.
