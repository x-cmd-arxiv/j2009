Because peaks can be identified in two-dimensional WL maps\ndirectly, they can provide constraints that are free from potential selection\neffects and biases involved in identifying and determining the masses of galaxy\nclusters. We have run cosmological N-body simulations to produce WL convergence\nmaps in three models with different constant values of the dark energy equation\nof state parameter, w=-0.8, -1, and -1.2, with a fixed normalization of the\nprimordial power spectrum (corresponding to present-day normalizations of\nsigma8=0.742, 0.798, and 0.839, respectively). By comparing the number of WL\npeaks in 8 convergence bins in the range of -0.1 < kappa < 0.2, in multiple\nrealizations of a single simulated 3x3 degree field, we show that the first\n(last) pair of models can be distinguished at the 95% (85%) confidence level. A\nsurvey with depth and area (20,000 sq. degrees), comparable to those expected\nfrom LSST, should have a factor of approx. 50 better parameter sensitivity. We\nfind that relatively low-amplitude peaks (kappa = 0.03), which typically do not\ncorrespond to a single collapsed halo along the line of sight, account for most\nof this sensitivity. We study a range of smoothing scales and source galaxy\nredshifts (z_s). With a fixed source galaxy density of 15/arcmin^2, the best\nresults are provided by the smallest scale we can reliably simulate, 1\narcminute, and z_s=2 provides substantially better sensitivity than z_s< 1.5.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jul 2009 18:33:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-06"}

It was argued that the smallness of gaugino masses is a\nconsequence of being in the lowest energy state of the SUSY-breaking low energy\neffective theory. To increase gaugino masses one either has to move to higher\nmetastable vacuum or alternatively remain in the original SUSY-breaking vacuum\nbut extend the theory by introducing a lower-lying vacuum elsewhere. We follow\nthe latter strategy and show that the ratio of gaugino to sfermion masses can\nbe continuously varied between zero and of order one by bringing in a lower\nvacuum from infinity.

The\nconcern has been that gravitational radiation would drain angular momentum so\nrapidly that generic orbits would circularize before zoom-whirl behavior could\nplay out, and only rare highly tuned orbits would retain their imprint. Using\nfull numerical relativity, we catch zoom-whirl behavior despite dissipation.\nThe larger the mass ratio, the longer the pair can spend in orbit before\nmerging and therefore the more zooms and whirls seen.

The\ndistribution of high-redshift quasars was recently used to constrain the power\nasymmetry on scales k ~ 1.5h/Mpc, and the upper bound on the amplitude of the\nasymmetry was found to be a factor of six smaller than the amplitude of the\nasymmetry in the CMB. We show that it is not possible to generate an asymmetry\nwith this scale dependence by changing the relative contributions of the\ninflaton and curvaton to the adiabatic power spectrum. Instead, we consider\ncurvaton scenarios in which the curvaton decays after dark matter freezes out,\nthus generating isocurvature perturbations. If there is a superhorizon\nfluctuation in the curvaton field, then the rms amplitude of these\nperturbations will be asymmetric, and the asymmetry will be most apparent on\nlarge angular scales in the CMB. We find that it is only possible to generate\nthe observed asymmetry in the CMB while satisfying the quasar constraint if the\ncurvaton's contribution to the total dark matter density is small, but nonzero.\nThe model also requires that the majority of the primordial power comes from\nfluctuations in the inflaton field.

We use the\nwell-established techniques of stellar population modeling to age-date the\nstars surrounding the site of the recent transient event in NGC 300 (NGC 300\nOT2008-1). The surrounding stars must share a common turnoff mass with the\ntransient, since almost all stars form in stellar clusters that remain\nphysically associated for periods longer than the lifetime of the most massive\nstars. We find that the precursor of NGC 300 OT2008-1 is surrounded by stars\nthat formed in a single burst between 8-13 Myr ago, with 70% confidence. The\ntransient was therefore likely to be due to a progenitor whose mass falls\nbetween the main sequence turnoff mass (12 Msun) and the maximum stellar mass\n(25 Msun) found for isochrones bounding this age range. We characterize the\ngeneral applicability of this technique in identifying precursor masses of\nhistoric and future transients and supernovae (SNe), noting that it requires\nneither precursor imaging nor sub-arcsecond accuracy in the position of the\ntransient. It is also based on the well-understood physics of the main\nsequence, and thus may be a more reliable source of precursor masses than\nfitting evolutionary tracks to precursor magnitudes.

In this contribution, after\nbriefly reviewing the approach, we will examine how probabilistic predictions\ncan arise. The Cournot principle and the use of approximate preclusions will\nplay a crucial role. Facing similar problems in interpreting probability as in\nclassical probability theory, we will resort to the weak form of Cournot\nprinciple, where possible realities will be preclusive co-events and the\nquantum measure is used to obtain predictions. Examples considered, includes\nthe fair coin and the double slit pattern arguably one of the most important\nparadigms for quantum theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Jul 2009 12:36:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-07"}

Given the prevalence of stochasticity and\nnoise in biochemical systems inference for stochastic models is of special\ninterest. In this paper we present a simple and computationally efficient\nalgorithm for the estimation of biochemical kinetic parameters from gene\nreporter data. We use the linear noise approximation to model biochemical\nreactions through a stochastic dynamic model which essentially approximates a\ndiffusion model by an ordinary differential equation model with an\nappropriately defined noise process. An explicit formula for the likelihood\nfunction can be derived allowing for computationally efficient parameter\nestimation. The proposed algorithm is embedded in a Bayesian framework and\ninference is performed using Markov chain Monte Carlo. The major advantage of\nthe method is that in contrast to the more established diffusion approximation\nbased methods the computationally costly methods of data augmentation are not\nnecessary. Our approach also allows for unobserved variables and measurement\nerror. The application of the method to both simulated and experimental data\nshows that the proposed methodology provides a useful alternative to diffusion\napproximation based methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Jul 2009 13:37:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-07"}

Several symbiotic WDs, however, produce strong X-ray\nemission at energies greater than ~20 keV. The Swift BAT instrument has\ndetected hard X-ray emission from 4 such accreting WDs in symbiotic stars: RT\nCru, T CrB, CD -57 3057, and CH Cyg. In one case (RT Cru), Swift detected\nX-rays out to greater than 50 keV at a > 5 sigma confidence level. Combining\ndata from the XRT and BAT detectors, we find that the 0.3-150 keV spectra of RT\nCru, T CrB, and CD -57 3057 are well described by emission from a\nsingle-temperature, optically thin thermal plasma, plus an unresolved 6.4-6.9\nkeV Fe line complex. The X-ray spectrum of CH Cyg contains an additional bright\nsoft component. For all 4 systems, the spectra suffer high levels of absorption\nfrom material that both fully and partially covers the source of hard X-rays.\nThe XRT data did not show any of the rapid, periodic variations that one would\nexpect if the X-ray emission were due to accretion onto a rotating, highly\nmagnetized WD. The X-rays were thus more likely from the accretion-disk\nboundary layer around a massive, non-magnetic WD in each binary. The X-ray\nemission from RT Cru varied on timescales of a few days. This variability is\nconsistent with being due to changes in the absorber that partially covers the\nsource, suggesting localized absorption from a clumpy medium moving into the\nline of sight. The X-ray emission from CD -57 3057 and T CrB also varied during\nthe 9 months of Swift observations, in a manner that was also consistent with\nvariable absorption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Jul 2009 14:21:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-19"}
