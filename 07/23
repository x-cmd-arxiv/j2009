We determined that EXO 1722-363\nwas of spectral type B0 - B1 Ia, positioned at a distance 8.0 +2.5/-2.0 kpc\nwith a progenitor mass in the range 30 - 40 M_Sun.

Ofpe/WNL stars demonstrate a high rate of mass-loss through a dense\nstellar wind combined with a low terminal velocity. This combination of wind\nproperties leads to a high accretion rate and transfer of angular momentum to\nthe neutron star in this system. We believe this in turn leads to a smaller\ninstantaneous equilibrium spin period with respect to normal OB supergiants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2009 16:55:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

They extend the\ngauge structure of the Standard Model by anomalous extra U(1) symmetries, which\ninvolve Stuckelberg axions for anomaly cancellation and are accompanied by\nChern-Simons interactions. In particular, these effective actions are\ncharacterized by a physical pseudoscalar (the axi-Higgs) in the CP-odd\nspectrum, which has the properties of a generalized Peccei-Quinn axion, with\nindependent mass and couplings to the gauge fields. Amplitudes mediated by\nanomalous gauge interactions are studied at the new collider in some specific\nchannels such as Drell-Yan and double prompt-photon and shown to be small.\nFinally, we address the problem of the relation between the Green-Schwarz and\nthe Wess-Zumino mechanism(s) for anomaly cancellations in effective lagrangeans\ninvolving anomalous gauge interactions, with their gauge symmetry restored\neither with local or non-local counterterms and identify some unitarity bounds\nin the Wess-Zumino case. These are due to the presence of anomaly poles in\nscattering amplitudes mediated by the anomaly (BIM amplitudes) and whose\ncancellation requires necessarly non-local counterterms. While the axi-Higgs\nappears in the Wess-Zumino case, two axion-like particles are needed for the\ncancellation of the gauge anomalies at all scales, one of them being a ghost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2009 16:29:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-23"}

The correlation functions are evaluated in the\nupper half-plane (or any conformally equivalent region) with operators at two\narbitrary points on the real axis, and a third arbitrary point on either the\nreal axis or in the interior. This type of result is of interest because it is\nboth exact and universal, relates higher-order correlation functions to\nlower-order ones, and has a simple interpretation in terms of cluster or loop\nprobabilities in several statistical models.

We examine\nspherical explosions in 15, 25 and 40 solar mass stars at Z = 0 and 10^-4 solar\nmetallicity with three explosion energies and two rotation rates.

Recently, three hot DQ white\ndwarfs have been reported to exhibit photometric variability with periods\ncompatible with pulsation g-modes. Here, we present a nonadiabatic pulsation\nanalysis of the recently discovered carbon-rich hot DQ white dwarf stars. One\nof our main aims is to test the convective-mixing picture for the origin of hot\nDQs through the pulsational properties. Our study relies on the full\nevolutionary models of hot DQ white dwarfs recently developed by Althaus et al.\n(2009), that consistently cover the whole evolution from the born-again stage\nto the white dwarf cooling track. Specifically, we present a stability analysis\nof white dwarf models from stages before the blue edge of the DBV instability\nstrip until the domain of the hot DQ white dwarfs, including the transition DB\n--> hot DQ white dwarf. We found that at evolutionary phases in which the\nmodels are characterized by He-dominated atmospheres, they exhibit unstable\n$g$-mode pulsations typical of DBV stars, and when the models become DQ white\ndwarfs with carbon-dominated atmospheres, they continue being pulsationally\nunstable with similar characteristics than DB models, and in agreement with the\nperiods detected in variable hot DQ white dwarfs. Our calculations provide\nstrong support to the convective-mixing picture for the formation of hot DQs.\nIn particular, our results point to the existence of pulsating DB white dwarfs\nwith very thin He-rich envelopes, which after passing the DBV instability strip\nbecome variable hot DQ stars. The existence of these DB stars with very thin\nenvelopes could be investigated through asteroseismology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2009 18:18:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Quantitative\nsegregation studies are also needed to characterize diffusion in ices, which\nunderpins all ice dynamics and ice chemistry. This study aims to quantify the\nsegregation mechanism and barriers in different H2O:CO2 and H2O:CO ice mixtures\ncovering a range of astrophysically relevant ice thicknesses and mixture\nratios. The ices are deposited at 16-50 K under (ultra-)high vacuum conditions.\nSegregation is then monitored at 23-70 K as a function of time, through\ninfrared spectroscopy. Thin (8-37 ML) H2O:CO2/CO ice mixtures segregate\nsequentially through surface processes, followed by an order of magnitude\nslower bulk diffusion. Thicker ices (>100 ML) segregate through a fast bulk\nprocess. The thick ices must therefore be either more porous or segregate\nthrough a different mechanism, e.g. a phase transition. The segregation\ndynamics of thin ices are reproduced qualitatively in Monte Carlo simulations\nof surface hopping and pair swapping. The experimentally determined\nsurface-segregation rates for all mixture ratios follow the Ahrrenius law with\na barrier of 1080[190] K for H2O:CO2 and 300[100] K for H2O:CO mixtures. During\nlow-mass star formation H2O:CO2 segregation will be important already at 30[5]\nK.

In this field, computer-aided design (CAD) is necessary in order\nto bridge the gap between computational modeling and biological data. An\napplication named TinkerCell has been created in order to serve as a CAD tool\nfor synthetic biology. TinkerCell is a visual modeling tool that supports a\nhierarchy of biological parts. Each part in this hierarchy consists of a set of\nattributes that define the part, such as sequence or rate constants. Models\nthat are constructed using these parts can be analyzed using various C and\nPython programs that are hosted by TinkerCell via an extensive C and Python\nAPI. TinkerCell supports the notion of a module, which are networks with\ninterfaces. Such modules can be connected to each other, forming larger modular\nnetworks. Because TinkerCell associates parameters and equations in a model\nwith their respective part, parts can be loaded from databases along with their\nparameters and rate equations. The modular network design can be used to\nexchange modules as well as test the concept of modularity in biological\nsystems. The flexible modeling framework along with the C and Python API allows\nTinkerCell to serve as a host to numerous third-party algorithms.

While the case of\nsmall strategy sets is by now well-understood, a lot of recent work has focused\non MAB problems with exponentially or infinitely large strategy sets, where one\nneeds to assume extra structure in order to make the problem tractable. In\nparticular, recent literature considered information on similarity between\narms.\n  We consider similarity information in the setting of \"contextual bandits\", a\nnatural extension of the basic MAB problem where before each round an algorithm\nis given the \"context\" -- a hint about the payoffs in this round. Contextual\nbandits are directly motivated by placing advertisements on webpages, one of\nthe crucial problems in sponsored search. A particularly simple way to\nrepresent similarity information in the contextual bandit setting is via a\n\"similarity distance\" between the context-arm pairs which gives an upper bound\non the difference between the respective expected payoffs.\n  Prior work on contextual bandits with similarity uses \"uniform\" partitions of\nthe similarity space, which is potentially wasteful. We design more efficient\nalgorithms that are based on adaptive partitions adjusted to \"popular\" context\nand \"high-payoff\" arms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 2009 06:41:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2011 00:49:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2011 17:32:29 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 13 Jan 2014 17:30:07 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 20 May 2014 03:52:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-21"}

These\nsimulations are motivated by our recent three-dimensional model of a\nstarburst-driven galactic wind interacting with an inhomogeneous disk, which\nshow that an optically emitting filament can be formed by the break-up and\nacceleration of a cloud into a supersonic wind. In this study we consider the\nevolution of a cloud with two different geometries (fractal and spherical) and\ninvestigate the importance of radiative cooling on the cloud's survival. We\nhave also undertaken a comprehensive resolution study in order to ascertain the\neffect of the assumed numerical resolution on the results. We find that the\nability of the cloud to radiate heat is crucial for its survival. While an\nadiabatic cloud is destroyed over a short period of time, a radiative cloud is\nbroken up via the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability into numerous small, dense\ncloudlets, which are drawn into the flow to form a filamentary structure. The\ndegree of fragmentation is highly dependent on the resolution of the\nsimulation, with the number of cloudlets formed increasing as the\nKelvin-Helmholtz instability is better resolved. Nevertheless, there is a clear\nqualitative trend, with the filamentary structure still persistent at high\nresolution. We confirm the mechanism behind the formation of the H-alpha\nemitting filaments found in our global simulations of a starburst-driven wind.\nBased on our resolution study, we conclude that bow shocks around accelerated\ngas clouds, and their interaction, are the main source of the soft X-ray\nemission observed in these galactic-scale winds.

Only for those very bright and nearby bursts\nlike GRB 030329, detection of VHE photons is possible under favorable observing\nconditions and a delayed observation time of $\\la$10 hours.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 2009 09:26:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 2009 09:18:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The opportunity is taken to\ncompare the near-IR spectra with those of Milky Way stars.\n  Methods: We used ISAAC on the ESO VLT to take J and H-band spectra of 36\ntargets in Fornax, Sculptor and NGC 6822.\n  Results: Twelve new C-stars are found in Fornax, and one is confirmed in\nSculptor.

Five luminous O-rich AGB\nstars are identified in NGC 6822, of which 3 show water absorption, indicative\nof spectral type M.

During its execution on the grid, the living\napplication makes choices on the resources to use in order to complete its\ntasks. These choices can be based on the internal state, or on autonomously\nacquired knowledge from external sensors. By giving limited user capabilities\nto a living application, the living application is able to port itself from one\nresource topology to another. The application performs these actions at\nrun-time without depending on users or external workflow tools. We demonstrate\nthis new concept in a special case of a living application: the living\nsimulation. Today, many simulations require a wide range of numerical solvers\nand run most efficiently if specialized nodes are matched to the solvers. The\nidea of the living simulation is that it decides itself which grid machines to\nuse based on the numerical solver currently in use. In this paper we apply the\nliving simulation to modelling the collision between two galaxies in a test\nsetup with two specialized computers. This simulation switces at run-time\nbetween a GPU-enabled computer in the Netherlands and a GRAPE-enabled machine\nthat resides in the United States, using an oct-tree N-body code whenever it\nruns in the Netherlands and a direct N-body solver in the United States.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 2009 12:00:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-27"}

This allows for an effective\nextrapolation of the equation of state for these models. Due to a nearby\n(nonphysical) singularity on the negative real z axis, standard methods (e.g.\nPad\\`e approximants based on the cluster integrals expansion) fail to capture\nthe behavior of these models near the ordering transition, and, in particular,\ndo not detect the critical point. A recent work (Eisenberg and Baram, PNAS {\\bf\n104}, 5755 (2007)) has shown that the critical exponents $\\sigma$ and\n$\\sigma'$, characterizing the singularity of the density as a function of the\nactivity, can be exactly calculated if the decay of the $R$ matrix elements to\ntheir asymptotic constant follows a $1/n^2$ law. Here we employ renormalization\narguments to extend this result and analyze cases for which the asymptotic\napproach of the $R$ matrix elements towards their limiting value is of a more\ngeneral form. The relevant asymptotic correction terms (in RG sense) are\nidentified and we then provide a corrected exact formula for the critical\nexponents. We identify the limits of usage of the formula, and demonstrate one\nphysical model which is beyond its range of validity. The new formula is\nvalidated numerically and then applied to analyze a number of concrete physical\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 2009 12:02:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-26"}

We report on these\nobservations which, for the first time, allow us to study the broad-band\nspectrum from soft to hard X-rays of this source. No X-ray spectral information\nwas available on this source before the Swift monitoring. The spectrum can be\ndeconvolved well with models usually adopted to describe the emission from High\nMass X-ray Binary X-ray pulsars, and is characterized by a very high\nabsorption, a flat power law (photon index ~0.1-0.5) and a cutoff at about 7-12\nkeV. Alternatively, the SAXJ1818.6-1703 emission can be described with a\nComptonized emission from a cold and optically thick corona, with an electron\ntemperature kTe=5-7 keV, a hot seed photon temperature, kT0, of 1.3-1.4 keV,\nand an optical depth for the Comptonizing plasma of about 10. The 1-100 keV\nluminosity at the peak of the flare is 3E36 erg/s (assuming the optical\ncounterpart distance of 2.5 kpc). These properties of SAXJ1818.6-1703 resemble\nthose of the prototype of the SFXT class, XTEJ1739-302.

These\nsolutions prove to be interesting as are characterized by the production of\nmass contributions arising from the nonlinear terms while maintaining a\nwave-like behavior. So, a quartic massless equation has a nonlinear wave\nsolution with a dispersion relation of a massive wave and a quartic scalar\ntheory gets its mass term renormalized in the dispersion relation through a\nterm depending on the coupling and an integration constant. When spontaneous\nbreaking of symmetry is considered, such wave-like solutions show how a mass\nterm with the wrong sign and the nonlinearity give rise to a proper dispersion\nrelation. These latter solutions do not change the sign maintaining the\nproperty of the selected value of the equilibrium state. Then, we use these\nsolutions to obtain a quantum field theory for the case of a quartic massless\nfield. We get the propagator from a first order correction showing that is\nconsistent in the limit of a very large coupling. The spectrum of a massless\nquartic scalar field theory is then provided. From this we can conclude that,\nfor an infinite countable number of exact classical solutions, there exist an\ninfinite number of equivalent quantum field theories that are trivial in the\nlimit of the coupling going to infinity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 2009 13:00:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2010 19:08:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-08"}

Comparison\nto available Ulysses data shows that a reasonable accounting for the data is\nprovided when (i) the energy exchange timescale is very long and (ii) the\ndeposition of heat due to turbulence is divided, with 60% going to proton\nheating and 40% into electron heating.

We compare solar differential rotation of subphotospheric layers\nderived from local helioseismology analysis of GONG++ dopplergrams and the one\nderived from tracing small bright coronal structures (SBCS) using EIT/SOHO\nimages for the period August 2001 - December 2006, which correspond to the\ndeclining phase of solar cycle 23. Aims. The study aims to find a relationship\nbetween the rotation of the SBCS and the subphotospheric angular velocity. The\nnorthsouth asymmetries of both rotation velocity measurements are also\ninvestigated. Methods. Subphotospheric differential rotation was derived using\nring-diagram analysis of GONG++ full-disk dopplergrams of 1 min cadence. The\ncoronal rotation was derived by using an automatic method to identify and track\nthe small bright coronal structures in EIT full-disk images of 6 hours cadence.\nResults. We find that the SBCS rotate faster than the considered upper\nsubphotospheric layer (3Mm) by about 0.5 deg/day at the equator. This result\njoins the results of several other magnetic features (sunspots, plages,\nfaculae, etc.) with a higher rotation than the solar plasma. The rotation rate\nlatitudinal gradients of the SBCS and the subphotospheric layers are very\nsimilar. The SBCS motion shows an acceleration of about 0.005 deg/day/month\nduring the declining phase of solar cycle 23, whereas the angular velocity of\nsubsurface layers does not display any evident variation with time, except for\nthe well known torsional oscillation pattern. Finally, both subphotospheric and\ncoronal rotations of the southern hemisphere are predominantly larger than\nthose of the northern hemisphere. At latitudes where the north-south asymmetry\nof the angular velocity increases (decreases) with activity for the SBCS, it\ndecreases (increases) for subphotospheric layers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 2009 15:40:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}
