We consider two different measures for regulating the\ndivergences of eternal inflation, and three different models for observers. In\none model, observers are assumed to arise in proportion to the entropy produced\nby stars; in the others, they arise at a fixed time (5 or 10 billion years)\nafter star formation. The star formation rate, which underlies all our observer\nmodels, depends sensitively on the three scanning parameters. We employ a\nrecently developed model of star formation in the multiverse, a considerable\nrefinement over previous treatments of the astrophysical and cosmological\nproperties of different pocket universes. For each combination of observer\nmodel and measure, we display all single and bivariate probability\ndistributions, both with the remaining parameter(s) held fixed, and\nmarginalized. Our results depend only weakly on the observer model but more\nstrongly on the measure. Using the causal diamond measure, the observed\nparameter values (or bounds) lie within the central $2\\sigma$ of nearly all\nprobability distributions we compute, and always within $3\\sigma$. This success\nis encouraging and rather nontrivial, considering the large size and dimension\nof the parameter space. The causal patch measure gives similar results as long\nas curvature is negligible. If curvature dominates, the causal patch leads to a\nnovel runaway: it prefers a negative value of the cosmological constant, with\nthe smallest magnitude available in the landscape.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2009 18:02:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-29"}

The correlation of the BP locations on the Fe XII radiance\nmap from EIT with the magnetic field features (in particular neutral lines) was\ninvestigated in detail. The coronal magnetic field was determined by an\nextrapolation of the photospheric field to different altitudes above the disk.\nIt was found that most BPs sit on or near a photospheric neutral line, but that\nthe emission occurs at a height of about 5 Mm. Some BPs, while being seen in\nprojection, still seem to coincide with neutral lines, although their emission\ntakes place at heights of more than 10 Mm.

As the underlying model of neuronal dynamics, we use the efficient\nRulkov map with additive noise. We show that increasing the coupling strength\nenhances synchronization monotonously, whereas delay plays a more subtle role.\nIn particular, we found that depending on the inherent oscillation frequency of\nindividual neurons, regions of irregular and regular propagating excitatory\nfronts appear intermittently as the delay increases. These delay-induced\nsynchronization transitions manifest as well-expressed minima in the measure\nfor spatial synchrony, appearing at every multiple of the oscillation\nfrequency. Larger coupling strengths or average degrees can broaden the region\nof regular propagating fronts by a given information transmission delay and\nfurther improve synchronization. These results are robust against variations in\nsystem size, intensity of additive noise and the scaling exponent of the\nunderlying scale-free topology. We argue that fine-tuned information\ntransmission delays are vital for assuring optimally synchronized excitatory\nfronts on complex neuronal networks, and indeed, they should be seen as\nimportant as the coupling strength or the overall density of interneuronal\nconnections.

Results for\nboth coherent and incoherent detection techniques are derived, for Cartesian,\nplanar and full-vectorial fields.

The\nratio is a natural outcome of (i) the stellar initial mass function that\nproduces more neutron stars than black holes and (ii) common envelope evolution\n(i.e. a major mechanism involved in the formation of interacting binaries) that\nnaturally selects progenitors of Be X-ray binaries with neutron stars (binaries\nwith comparable mass components have more likely survival probabilities) over\nones with black holes (which are much more likely to be common envelope\nmergers). A comparison of this ratio (i.e. F_NStoBH=30) with the number of\nconfirmed Be -- neutron star X-ray binaries (42) indicates that the expected\nnumber of Be -- black hole X-ray binaries is of the order of only 0-2. This is\nentirely consistent with the observed Galactic sample.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2009 20:10:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 Nov 2009 20:19:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Significant\ncontributions to the apsidal precession rate are made by the secular\nplanet-planet interaction, by general relativity, and by the gravitational\nquadropole fields created by the transiting planet's tidal and rotational\ndistortions. The fixed-point orbital eccentricity of the inner planet is\ntherefore a strong function of the planet's interior structure. We illustrate\nthese ideas in the specific context of the recently discovered HAT-P-13\nexo-planetary system, and show that one can already glean important insights\ninto the physical properties of the inner transiting planet. We present\nstructural models of the planet, which indicate that its observed radius can be\nmaintained for a one-parameter sequence of models that properly vary core mass\nand tidal energy dissipation in the interior. We use an octopole-order secular\ntheory of the orbital dynamics to derive the dependence of the inner planet's\neccentricity, on its tidal Love number. We find that the currently measured\neccentricity, implies 0.116 < k2_{b} < 0.425, 0 M_{Earth}<M_{core}<120\nM_{Earth}$, and Q_{b} < 300,000.

The study presents a\nstatistical-thermodynamic analysis of relationship between the sequence\ncomposition and the distribution of residue fluctuations in protein-protein\ncomplexes. A one-node-per residue elastic network model accounting for the\nnonhomogeneous protein mass distribution and the inter-atomic interactions\nthrough the renormalized inter-residue potential is developed. Two factors, a\nprotein mass distribution and a residue environment, were found to determine\nthe scale of residue fluctuations. Surface residues undergo larger fluctuations\nthan core residues, showing agreement with experimental observations. Ranking\nresidues over the normalized scale of fluctuations yields a distinct\nclassification of amino acids into three groups. The structural instability in\nproteins possibly relates to the high content of the highly fluctuating\nresidues and a deficiency of the weakly fluctuating residues in irregular\nsecondary structure elements (loops), chameleon sequences and disordered\nproteins. Strong correlation between residue fluctuations and the sequence\ncomposition of protein loops supports this hypothesis. Comparing fluctuations\nof binding site residues (interface residues) with other surface residues shows\nthat, on average, the interface is more rigid than the rest of the protein\nsurface and Gly, Ala, Ser, Cys, Leu and Trp have a propensity to form more\nstable docking patches on the interface.

Generally, mobilities increased with\ndecreasing carrier density, independent of carrier type and substrate polytype.\nThe contributions of scattering mechanisms to the conductivities of the films\nare discussed. The results suggest that for near-intrinsic carrier densities at\n300 K epitaxial graphene mobilities will be ~150,000 cm2V-1s-1 on the (000-1)\nface and ~5,800 cm2V-1s-1 on the (0001) face.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2009 15:32:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-27"}

At the same time single layer graphene has been the subject of intense\nresearch due to both its fundamental properties as well as its potential\napplication in nanoscale electronics. While defects can significantly alter the\nelectronic properties of nanoscopic systems, the lack of control can lead to\nseemingly deleterious effects arising from the random arrangement of such\nimpurities. Here we demonstrate, using {\\it ab initio} density functional\ntheory and non-equilibrium Green's functions calculations, that it is possible\nto obtain perfect spin selectivity in doped graphene nanoribbons to produce a\nperfect spin filter. We show that initially unpolarized electrons entering the\nsystem give rise to 100% polarization of the current due to random disorder.\nThis effect is explained in terms of different localization lengths for each\nspin channel which together with the well know exponential dependence of the\nconductance on the length of the device leads to a new mechanism for the spin\nfiltering effect that is enhanced by disorder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2009 23:58:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

This requires that there be a formal quantitative relationship\ninvolving the entropy and the angular velocity. Earlier work has suggested that\nthis could arise from magnetohydrodynamic stability constraints; here we argue\nthat purely hydrodynamical processes could also lead to such a result. Of\nspecial importance to the hydrodynamical solution is the fact that the thermal\nwind equation is insensitive to radial entropy gradients. This allows a much\nmore general class of solutions to fit the solar isorotation contours, beyond\njust those in which the entropy itself must be a function of the angular\nvelocity. In particular, for this expanded class, the thermal wind solution of\nthe solar rotation profile remains valid even when large radial entropy\ngradients are present. A clear and explicit example of this class of solution\nappears to be present in published numerical simulations of the solar\nconvective zone. Though hydrodynamical in character, the theory is not\nsensitive to the presence of weak magnetic fields. Thus, the identification of\nsolar isorotation contours with the characteristics of the thermal wind\nequation appears to be robust, accommodating, but by no means requiring,\nmagnetic field dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2009 09:27:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Sum-squeezing can provide amounts of squeezing greater than those\nproduced by the $n$th higher-order ($n\\geq 2$) squeezing for the same values of\ninteraction parameters and can map onto amplitude-squared squeezing. Further,\nwe prove that the difference-squeezing is not relevant measure for obtaining\ninformation about squeezing from this device.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2009 09:55:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

We see that\nthose ``starless'' IRDC cores and the IRDC cores associated with 24um emission\nare drawn from the same column density population and are of similar mass. If\nwe then assume the cores without 24um embedded sources are at an earlier\nevolutionary stage to cores with embedded objects we derive a statistical\nlifetime for the quiescent phase of a few 10^3-10^4 years.

As a case study, a regular black Saturn system where the\ncentral black hole has vanishing intrinsic angular momentum, J^{BH}=0, is\nconsidered. It is shown that there is a correlation between the sign of two\nresponse functions. One is interpreted as a moment of inertia of the black ring\nin the black Saturn system. The other measures the variation of the black ring\nhorizon angular velocity with the central black hole mass, for fixed ring mass\nand angular momentum. The two different phases defined by these response\nfunctions collapse, for small central black hole mass, to the thin and fat ring\nphases. In the fat phase, the zero area limit of the black Saturn ring has\nreduced spin j^2>1, which is related to the behaviour of the ring angular\nvelocity. Using the `gravitomagnetic clock effect', for which a universality\nproperty is exhibited, it is shown that frame dragging measured by an\nasymptotic observer decreases, in both phases, when the central black hole mass\nincreases, for fixed ring mass and angular momentum. A close parallelism\nbetween the results for the fat phase and those obtained recently for the\ndouble Kerr solution is drawn, considering also a regular black Saturn system\nwith J^{BH}\\neq 0.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2009 10:58:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

For most LIRGs in our sample, the peaks of the continuum and\ngas (e.g., Halpha, [NII]) emissions coincide, unlike what is observed in local,\nstrongly interacting ULIRGs. The only exceptions are galaxies with\ncircumnuclear rings of star formation where the most luminous Halpha emitting\nregions are found in the rings rather than in the nuclei, and the displacements\nare well understood in terms of differences in the stellar populations. A large\nfraction of the nuclei of these LIRGs are classified as LINER and intermediate\nLINER/HII, or composite objects. The excitation conditions of the integrated\nemission depend on the relative contributions of HII regions and the diffuse\nemission to the line emission over the PMAS FoV. Galaxies dominated by high\nsurface-brightness HII regions show integrated HII-like excitation. A few\ngalaxies show slightly larger integrated [NII]/Halpha and [SII]/Halpha line\nratios than the nuclear ones, probably because of more contribution from the\ndiffuse emission. The Halpha velocity fields over the central few kpc are\ngenerally consistent, at least to first order, with rotational motions. The\nvelocity fields of most LIRGs are similar to those of disk galaxies, in\ncontrast to the highly perturbed fields of most local, strongly interacting\nULIRGs. The peak of the Halpha velocity dispersion coincides with the position\nof the nucleus and is likely to be tracing mass. All these results are similar\nto the properties of z~1 LIRGs, and they highlight the importance of detailed\nstudies of flux-limited samples of local LIRGs.

A careful study of the intensity spectrum\nreveals the presence of a cool spectroscopic companion. By modelling the binary\nspectrum we infer the effective temperature of both stars: $10500\\pm 500$ K for\nthe primary, and $5500\\pm500$ K for the secondary, and we argue that the high\nmetallicity ($[M/H] = 0.5$), required to fit the lines may imply that the\nprimary is a chemically peculiar star. We observe that the radial velocity of\nthe secondary's lines varies with time, while that of the the primary does not.\nBy fitting these variations we derive the orbital parameters of the system. We\nfind an orbital period of $104\\pm5$ d, and a mass ratio ($M_{\\rm P}/M_{\\rm S}$)\nlarger than 2.9. The intensity spectrum is heavily contaminated with strong,\nbroad and variable emission. A simple analysis of these lines reveals that a\ndisk might surround the binary, and that a wind occurs in the environment of\nthe system. Finally, we performed a magnetic analysis using the Least-Squares\nDeconvolved (LSD) profiles of the Stokes $V$ spectra of both stars, and\nadopting the oblique rotator model. From rotational modulation of the primary's\nStokes $V$ signatures, we infer its rotation period $P=4.31276\\pm0.00042$ d,\nand find that it hosts a centred dipole magnetic field of polar strength\n$2.12\\pm0.15$ kG, with a magnetic obliquity $\\beta = 66\\pm5^{\\circ}$, and a\nrotation axis inclination $i=32\\pm5^{\\circ}$.

This means the normal\nform of an element $u^{-1}v$ yields the shortest path between $u$ and $v$ in\nthe Cayley graph. For horocyclic elements the peak normal form and the\nlength-lexicographical normal form coincide. The main result of this paper is\nthat we can compute the peak normal form in polynomial time if $p$ divides $q$.\nAs consequence we can compute geodesic lengths in this case.

We have argued previously,\nin the context of bosons, that the so-called flavour vacuum is the appropriate\nstate to be used, at least for low-energy excitations, with energies/momenta up\nto a dynamically determined cutoff scale. In this work we evaluate the\nflavour-vacuum expectation value (condensate) of the stress-energy tensor of\nthe (1/2)-spin fields with mixing in an effective low-energy Quantum Field\nTheory in this foam-induced curved space-time. We demonstrate, at late epochs\nof the Universe, that the fermionic vacuum condensate behaves as a fluid with\nnegative pressure and positive energy, but alone it cannot lead to present-day\naccelerating Universes. One needs flavoured boson contributions for this\npurpose.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2009 14:29:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-05"}

A weak tilt of the washboard potential is applied biasing\none direction for particle transport. However, the tilt vanishes asymptotically\nin the direction of bias. Moreover, the total energy content is not enough for\nboth particles to be able to escape simultaneously from an initial potential\nwell; to achieve transport the coupled particles need to interact\ncooperatively. For low coupling strength the two particles remain trapped\ninside the starting potential well permanently. For increased coupling strength\nthere exists a regime in which one of the particles transfers the majority of\nits energy to the other one, as a consequence of which the latter escapes from\nthe potential well and the bond between them breaks. Finally, for suitably\nlarge couplings, coordinated energy exchange between the particles allows them\nto achieve escapes -- one particle followed by the other -- from consecutive\npotential wells resulting in directed collective motion. The key mechanism of\ntransport rectification is based on the asymptotically vanishing tilt causing a\nsymmetry breaking of the non-chaotic fraction of the dynamics in the mixed\nphase space.

In\nthis work we combine detailed boundary-integral simulations with analytical\nmodeling to describe the formation and break-up of such Worthington jets in two\ncommon physical systems: the impact of a circular disc on a liquid surface and\nthe release of air bubbles from an underwater nozzle. We first show that the\njet base dynamics can be predicted for both systems using our earlier model in\nGekle, Gordillo, van der Meer and Lohse. Phys. Rev. Lett. 102 (2009).\nNevertheless, our main point here is to present a model which allows us to\naccurately predict the shape of the entire jet. Good agreement with numerics\nand some experimental data is found. Moreover, we find that, contrarily to the\ncapillary breakup of liquid cylinders in vacuum studied by Rayleigh, the\nbreakup of stretched liquid jets at high values of both Weber and Reynolds\nnumbers is not triggered by the growth of perturbations coming from an external\nsource of noise. Instead, the jet breaks up due to the capillary deceleration\nof the liquid at the tip which produces a corrugation to the jet shape. This\nperturbation, which is self-induced by the flow, will grow in time promoted by\na capillary mechanism. We are able to predict the exact shape evolution of\nWorthington jets ejected after the impact of a solid object - including the\nsize of small droplets ejected from the tip due to a surface-tension driven\ninstability - using as the single input parameters the minimum radius of the\ncavity and the flow field before the jet emerges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2009 15:29:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

By controlling the physical location of transmitter--receiver\npairs, we can match a large proportion of these pairs to form so-called\n$\\epsilon$-bottleneck links, with consequent control of the sum capacity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2009 15:47:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-12"}

In this paper, the problem of coordinating a\nnetwork of sensors to train a unique ensemble estimator under communication\nconstraints is discussed. The information structure of graphical models with\nspecific potential functions is employed, and this thus converts the\ncollaborative training task into a problem of local training plus global\ninference. Two important classes of algorithms of graphical model inference,\nmessage-passing algorithm and sampling algorithm, are employed to tackle\nlow-dimensional, parametrized and high-dimensional, non-parametrized problems\nrespectively. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated by concrete\nexamples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2009 15:59:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}
