In this work we study the glass transition of highly\ncrystallized PET and in which way it is modified by secondary crystallization.\nAmorphous PET samples were annealed for 4 hours at temperatures between 140C\nand 180C. The secondary crystallization process was monitored by differential\nscanning calorimetry and the glass transition of the remaining interllamelar\namorphous phase was studied by Thermally Stimulated Depolarization Currents\nmeasurements. Non--isothermal window polarization is employed to resolve the\nrelaxation in modes with a well--defined relaxation time that are subsequently\nadjusted to several standard models. Analysis of experimental results, show\nthat cooperativity is reduced to a great extend in the interlamellar amorphous\nregions. The evolution of the modes on crystallization temperature reveals that\nlarge scale movements are progressively replaced by more localized ones, with\nhigher frequency, as crystallization takes place at higher temperatures. As a\nconsequence, the glass transition temperature of the amorphous interlamellar\nphase tends to lower values for higher annealing temperatures.

This\nis surprising because one might have expected most of the progenitors of field\nS0 galaxies to have been flattened late-type galaxies, whereas lenticulars in\nclusters are thought to have mostly been derived from bulge-dominated\nearly-type galaxies.

This is a new situation which\nenables long term astrometric projects that could not be achieved by either\nmission alone. Using the well-known perspective acceleration effect on\nastrometric measurements, the true heliocentric radial velocity of a nearby\nstar can be measured with great precision if the time baseline of the\nastrometric measurements is long enough. Since white dwarfs are compact\nobjects, the gravitational redshift can be quite large (40-80 km/s), and is the\npredominant source of any shift in wavelength. The mismatch of the true radial\nvelocity with the spectroscopic shift thus leads to a direct measure of the\nMass--Radius relation for such objects. Using available catalog information\nabout the known nearby white dwarfs, we estimate how many masses/gravitational\nredshift measurements can be obtained with an accuracy better than 2%. Nearby\nwhite dwarfs are relatively faint objects (10 < V < 15), which can be easily\nobserved by both missions.

In accordance with earlier scaling\ntheory and stochastic dynamics simulations findings we have identified three\nregimes of extensional deformation: (i) a linear response regime characterized\nby a weakly elongated (ellipsoidal) shape of the globule at small deformations,\n(ii) a tadpole structure with a globular \"head\" coexisting with a stretched\n\"tail\" at intermediate ranges of deformations, and (iii) an uniformly stretched\nchain at strong extensions. The conformational transition from the tadpole to\nthe stretched chain is accompanied by an abrupt unfolding of the depleted\nglobular head and a corresponding jump-wise drop in the intrachain tension. The\nunfolding-refolding cycle demonstrates a hysteresis loop in the vicinity of the\ntransition point. These three regimes of deformation, as well as the\nfirst-order like transition between the tadpole and the stretched chain\nconformations, can be experimentally observable provided that the number of\nmonomer units in the chain is large and/or the solvent quality is sufficiently\npoor. For short chains, on the other hand, under moderately poor solvent\nstrength conditions, the unfolding transition is continuous. Upon an increase\nin the imposed end-to-end distance the extended globule retains a\nlongitudinally uniform shape at any degree of deformation.

The spin wave frequencies were\nmeasured using spectrally resolved electrical noise measurements. In all\nspectra, several independent quantized spin wave modes have been observed and\ncould be identified as eigenexcitations of the free layer and of the synthetic\nantiferromagnet of the junction. Using a theoretical approach based on the\ndiagonalization of the dynamical matrix of a system of three coupled, spatially\nconfined magnetic layers, we have modeled the spectra for the smallest pillar\nand have extracted its material parameters. The magnetization and exchange\nstiffness constant of the CoFeB free layer are thereby found to be\nsubstantially reduced compared to the corresponding thin film values. Moreover,\nwe could infer that the pinning of the magnetization at the lateral boundaries\nmust be weak. Finally, the interlayer dipolar coupling between the free layer\nand the synthetic antiferromagnet causes mode anticrossings with gap openings\nup to 2 GHz. At low fields and in the larger pillars, there is clear evidence\nfor strong non-uniformities of the layer magnetizations. In particular, at zero\nfield the lowest mode is not the fundamental mode, but a mode most likely\nlocalized near the layer edges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2009 11:39:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2010 08:51:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

We explore the relationship between\nQuasi-Separatrix Layers (QSLs), that is, layer-like structures with high Q\nvalue, electric currents and integrated parallel currents, the latter being a\nquantity closely related to the reconnection rate. It is found that as the\ndegree of braiding of the magnetic field is increased the maximum values of Q\nincrease exponentially. At the same time, the distribution of Q becomes\nincreasingly filamentary, with the width of the high-Q layers exponentially\ndecreasing. This is accompanied by an increase in the number of layers so that\nas the field is increasingly braided the volume becomes occupied by a myriad of\nthin QSLs. QSLs are not found to be good predictors of current features in this\nclass of braided fields. Indeed, despite the presence of multiple QSLs, the\ncurrent associated with the field remains smooth and large-scale under ideal\nrelaxation; the field dynamically adjusts to a smooth equilibrium. Regions of\nhigh Q are found to be better related to regions of high integrated parallel\ncurrent than to actual current sheets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2009 13:31:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

We formulate a simple one-dimensional model problem\nand give a detailed analysis of the stability of the force-based quasicontinuum\n(QCF) method. The focus of the analysis is the question whether the QCF method\nis able to predict a critical load at which fracture occurs. Numerical\nexperiments show that the spectrum of a linearized QCF operator is identical to\nthe spectrum of a linearized energy-based quasi-nonlocal quasicontinuum\noperator (QNL), which we know from our previous analyses to be positive below\nthe critical load. However, the QCF operator is non-normal and it turns out\nthat it is not generally positive definite, even when all of its eigenvalues\nare positive. Using a combination of rigorous analysis and numerical\nexperiments, we investigate in detail for which choices of \"function spaces\"\nthe QCF operator is stable, uniformly in the size of the atomistic system.\nForce-based multi-physics coupling methods are popular techniques to circumvent\nthe difficulties faced in formulating consistent energy-based coupling\npproaches. Even though the QCF method is possibly the simplest coupling method\nof this kind, we anticipate that many of our observations apply more generally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2009 15:17:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-19"}
