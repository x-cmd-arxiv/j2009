In the\ntheory that we are conjecturing, the vacuum expectation value of the (bare)\nenergy momentum tensor is exactly the same as in flat space: quartically\ndivergent with the cut-off and with no spacetime dependent (subleading) ter ms.\nThe presence of such terms seems in fact related to some known difficulties,\nsuch as the black hole information loss and the cosmological constant problem.\nSince the terms that we want to get rid of are subleading in the high-momentum\nexpansion, we attempt to explore the conjectured theory by \"IR-completing\" GR.\nWe consider a scalar field in a flat FRW Universe and isolate the first\nIR-correction to its Fourier modes operators that kills the quadratic (next to\nleading) time dependent divergence of the stress energy tensor VEV. Analogously\nto other modifications of field operators that have been proposed in the\nliterature (typically in the UV), the present approach seems to suggest a\nbreakdown (here, in the IR, at large distances) of the metric manifold\ndescription. We show that corrections to GR are in fact very tiny, become\neffective at distances comparable to the inverse curvature and do not contain\nany adjustable parameter. Finally, we derive some cosmological implications. By\nstudying the consistency of the canonical commutation relations, we infer a\ncorrection to the distance between two comoving observers, which grows as the\nscale factor only when small compared to the Hubble length, but gets relevant\ncorrections otherwise. The corrections to cosmological distance measures are\nalso calculable and, for a spatially flat matter dominated Universe, go in the\ndirection of an effective positive acceleration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2009 17:14:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2009 19:30:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2009 14:39:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-07"}

We introduce a new E-/B-mode decomposition of the cosmic\nshear two-point correlation on a finite interval. This new statistic is\noptimised for cosmological applications, by maximising the signal-to-noise\nratio (S/N) and a figure of merit (FoM) based on the Fisher matrix of the\ncosmological parameters Omega_m and sigma_8.\n  We improve both S/N and FoM results substantially with respect to the\nrecently introduced ring statistic, which also provides E-/B-mode separation on\na finite angular range. The S/N (FoM) is larger by a factor of three (two) on\nangular scales between 1 and 220 arc minutes. In addition, it yields better\nresults than for the aperture-mass dispersion <M_ap>^2, with improvements of\n20% (10%) for S/N (FoM).

The e+/e- ratio (measured up to ~100 GeV) increases\nunexpectedly above 10 GeV and this may be connected to the excess measured in\nall-electron flux at 300-800 GeV. Measurement of this ratio at higher energies\nis a key parameter to understand the origin of these spectral anomalies.\nImaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACT) detect electromagnetic air\nshowers above 100 GeV, but, with this technique, the discrimination between\nprimary e-, e+ and diffuse gamma-rays is almost impossible.

We demonstrate that the\nanalytical theory is in a good qualitative (and in some aspects quantitative)\nagreement with the exact calculations. There are however some important\ndiscrepancies. In order to understand the origin of these discrepancies we\ninvestigate the self-consistent electronic structure and charge density\ndistribution in the nanoribbons and relate the above discrepancy to the\ninability of the simple electrostatic model to capture the classical gate\nelectrostatics of the GNRs. In turn, the failure of the classical\nelectrostatics is traced to the quantum mechanical effects leading to the\nsignificant modification of the self-consistent charge distribution in\ncomparison to the non-interacting electron description. The role of\nelectron-electron interaction in the electronic structure and the capacitance\nof the GNRs is discussed. Our exact numerical calculations show that the\ndensity distribution and the potential profile in the GNRs are qualitatively\ndifferent from those in conventional split-gate quantum wires; at the same\ntime, the electron distribution and the potential profile in the GNRs show\nqualitatively similar features to those in the cleaved-edge overgrown quantum\nwires.

Each\nnode is weighted according to its load capacity, and links are weighted\naccording to the Euclidean distance that separates each pair of nodes. Local\nrules describing the behavior of individual nodes in terms of the surrounding\nflow have been also modelled, and a random network topology has been chosen in\na baseline approach. Numerical simulations describing the diffusion of a given\nnumber of agents (aircraft) in this network show the onset of a jamming\ntransition that distinguishes an efficient regime with null amount of airport\nqueues and high diffusivity (free phase) and a regime where bottlenecks\nsuddenly take place, leading to a poor aircraft diffusion (congested phase).\nFluctuations are maximal around the congestion threshold, suggesting that the\ntransition is critical. We then proceed by exploring the robustness of our\nresults in neutral random topologies by embedding the model in heterogeneous\nnetworks. Specifically, we make use of the European air transportation network\nformed by 858 airports and 11170 flight routes connecting them, which we show\nto be scale-free. The jamming transition is also observed in this case.

Our algorithm is polynomial in all\nparameters other than $k$. The algorithm is based on an appropriate grid search\nover the space of parameters. The theoretical analysis of the algorithm hinges\non a reduction of the problem to 1 dimension and showing that two 1-dimensional\nmixtures whose densities are close in the $L^2$ norm must have similar means\nand mixing coefficients. To produce such a lower bound for the $L^2$ norm in\nterms of the distances between the corresponding means, we analyze the behavior\nof the Fourier transform of a mixture of Gaussians in 1 dimension around the\norigin, which turns out to be closely related to the properties of the\nVandermonde matrix obtained from the component means. Analysis of this matrix\ntogether with basic function approximation results allows us to provide a lower\nbound for the norm of the mixture in the Fourier domain.\n  In recent years much research has been aimed at understanding the\ncomputational aspects of learning parameters of Gaussians mixture distributions\nin high dimension.

Specifically, we consider an\nadditive Bernoulli($q$) noise model where we show that, for $N$ items and $K$\ndefectives, the number of tests $T$ is $O(\\frac{K\\log N}{1-q})$ for arbitrarily\nsmall average error probability and $O(\\frac{K^2\\log N}{1-q})$ for a worst case\nerror criterion. We also consider dilution effects whereby a defective item in\na positive pool might get diluted with probability $u$ and potentially missed.\nIn this case, it is shown that $T$ is $O(\\frac{K\\log N}{(1-u)^2})$ and\n$O(\\frac{K^2\\log N}{(1-u)^2})$ for the average and the worst case error\ncriteria, respectively. Furthermore, our bounds allow us to verify existing\nknown bounds for noiseless group testing including the deterministic noise-free\ncase and approximate reconstruction with bounded distortion. Our proof of\nachievability is based on random coding and the analysis of a Maximum\nLikelihood Detector, and our information theoretic lower bound is based on\nFano's inequality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2009 18:13:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2009 20:33:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2010 20:37:52 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 23 Dec 2010 23:43:32 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 12 Jun 2012 20:54:52 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 2013 15:31:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

The information on the asymmetries of the Ly-a and Ly-b\nprofiles is obtained through the calculation of the 1st and 3rd-order moments\nof the line profiles.

A central baryon enhancement that could explain this\ndiscrepancy is not observed, leaving a major puzzle. We propose a solution\nbased on the merger histories of clusters. A significant fraction of the final\ndark matter content of a cluster halo originates within galaxy-sized halos, in\nwhich gas can cool and compress the dark matter core to high densities. The\nsubsequent tidal stripping of this compressed dark matter occurs in denser\nregions that are closer to the center of the cluster halo. Eventually, the\noriginally cooled gas must be dispersed into the intracluster medium through\nfeedback, for consistency with observations that do not find central baryon\nenhancements in clusters.

Non-relativistic quantum mechanics does not reject the existence of\nthe immediate values of the classical physical quantities, nevertheless not\neach of them can be simultaneously measured (the uncertainty principle).\nRelativistic quantum mechanics rejects the existence of the immediate values of\nany physical quantity in principle, and consequently the notion of the system\nstate, including the notion of the wave function, which becomes rigorously\nnondefinable.\n  The task of this work consists in econophysical analysis of the conceptual\nfundamentals and mathematical apparatus of the classical physics, relativity\ntheory, non-relativistic and relativistic quantum mechanics, subject to the\nhistorical, psychological and philosophical aspects and modern state of the\nsocio-economic modeling problem. We have shown that actually and, virtually, a\nlong time ago, new paradigms of modeling were accepted in the quantum theory,\nwithin the bounds of which the notion of the physical quantity operator becomes\nthe primary fundamental conception, description of the system dynamics becomes\ndiscrete and approximate in its essence, prediction of the future, even in the\nrough, is actually impossible when setting aside the aftereffect i.e. the\nmemory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2009 06:25:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-08"}

Such a characteristic comes\nfrom a fact that zero-energy states in a particular valley are restricted to\nonly one of the spinor components, whereas the other spinor component is\nnecessarily zero. In the case of the tilted Dirac cones as found in\n$\\alpha$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$I$_3$, one obtains a non-zero value of the second\ncomponent and then the ackscattering processes between valleys becomes\nnon-zero. It is shown that this fact can lead to easy-plane pseudospin\nferromagnetism (XY-type). In this case, the phase fluctuations of the order\nparameters can be described by the XY model leading to Kosterlitz-Thouless\ntransition at lower temperature. In view of these theoretical results,\nexperimental findings in resistivity of $\\alpha$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$I$_3$ are\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2009 08:17:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

They are expected to leave\nsignatures in the observed cosmic microwave background anisotropies. We\nsignificantly improved our previous analysis [1] of the 5-year WMAP $TT$ and\n$TE$ data at lower multipoles $\\ell$. This more general analysis returned\nessentially the same maximum likelihood (ML) result (unfortunately, surrounded\nby large remaining uncertainties): the relic gw are present and they are\nresponsible for approximately 20% of the temperature quadrupole. We identify\nand discuss the reasons by which the contribution of gw can be overlooked in a\ndata analysis. One of the reasons is a misleading reliance on data from very\nhigh multipoles $\\ell$, another - a too narrow understanding of the problem as\nthe search for $B$-modes of polarization, rather than the detection of relic gw\nwith the help of all correlation functions. Our analysis of WMAP5 data has led\nto the identification of a whole family of models characterized by relatively\nhigh values of the likelihood function. Using the Fisher matrix formalism we\nformulated forecasts for {\\it Planck} mission in the context of this family of\nmodels. We explore in details various `optimistic', `pessimistic' and `dream\ncase' scenarios. We show that in some circumstances the $B$-mode detection may\nbe very inconclusive, at the level of signal-to-noise ratio $S/N =1.75$,\nwhereas a smarter data analysis can reveal the same gw signal at $S/N= 6.48$.\nThe final result is encouraging. Even under unfavourable conditions in terms of\ninstrumental noises and foregrounds, the relic gw, if they are characterized by\nthe ML parameters that we found from WMAP5 data, will be detected by {\\it\nPlanck} at the level $S/N = 3.65$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2009 09:31:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2009 10:55:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2009 13:24:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

One of these differences is the presence or absence of a Wolf-Rayet (WR)\nphase of the progenitor star. The mass loss history of the progenitor star\nstrongly affects the shape of the Supernova remnant (SNR). In this paper we\ninvestigate whether the progenitor star of Cas A had a WR phase or not and how\nlong it may have lasted. We performed two-dimensional multi-species\nhydrodynamical simulations of the CSM around the progenitor star for several WR\nlife times, each followed by the interaction of the supernova ejecta with the\nCSM. We then looked at the influence of the length of the WR phase and compared\nthe results of the simulations with the observations of Cas A. The difference\nin the structure of the CSM, for models with different WR life times, has a\nstrong impact on the resulting SNR. With an increasing WR life time the reverse\nshock velocity of the SNR decreases and the range of observed velocities in the\nshocked material increases. Furthermore, if a WR phase occurs, the remainders\nof the WR shell will be visible in the resulting SNR. Comparing our results\nwith the observations suggests that the progenitor star of Cas A did not have a\nWR phase. We also find that the quasi-stationary flocculi (QSF) in Cas A are\nnot consistent with the clumps from a WR shell that have been shocked and\naccelerated by the interaction with the SN ejecta.

Analysis of the light curves provides oscillation frequencies\nthat make it possible to probe the interior of the stars. However, additional\nconstraints on the fundamental parameters of the stars are important for the\ntheoretical modelling to be successful. We will estimate the fundamental\nparameters (mass, radius and luminosity) of the first four solar-like targets\nto be observed in the asteroseismic field. In addition, we will determine their\neffective temperature, metallicity and detailed abundance pattern. To constrain\nthe stellar mass, radius and age we use the SHOTGUN software which compares the\nlocation of the stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram with theoretical\nevolution models. This method takes into account the uncertainties of the\nobserved parameters including the large separation determined from the\nsolar-like oscillations. We determine the effective temperatures and abundance\npatterns in the stars from the analysis of high-resolution spectra. We have\ndetermined the mass, radius and luminosity of the four CoRoT targets to within\n5-10 percent, 2-4 percent and 5-13 percent, respectively. The quality of the\nstellar spectra determines how well we can constrain the effective temperature.\nFor the two best spectra we get 1-sigma uncertainties below 60 K and for the\nother two 100-150 K. The uncertainty on the surface gravity is less than 0.08\ndex for three stars while for HD 181906 it is 0.15 dex. The reason for the\nlarger uncertainty is that the spectrum has two components with a luminosity\nratio of Lp/Ls = 0.50+-0.15. While Hipparcos astrometric data strongly suggest\nit is a binary star we find evidence that the fainter star may be a background\nstar, since it is less luminous but hotter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2009 11:59:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

We give a new proof, which does not\nrequire the compactness of M. More generally, we prove that the evolution of\nany half-flat G-structure on a six-manifold M defines an extension of M to a\nRicci-flat seven-manifold N, for any real form G of SL(3,C). If G is\nnoncompact, then the holonomy group of N is a subgroup of the noncompact form\nG_2^* of G_2^C. Similar results are obtained for the extension of nearly\nhalf-flat structures by nearly parallel G_2- or G_2^*-structures, as well as\nfor the extension of cocalibrated G_2- and G_2^*-structures by parallel\nSpin(7)- and Spin(3,4)-structures, respectively. As an application, we obtain\nthat any six-dimensional homogeneous manifold with an invariant half-flat\nstructure admits a canonical extension to a seven-manifold with a parallel G_2-\nor G_2^*-structure. For the group H_3 \\times H_3, where H_3 is the\nthree-dimensional Heisenberg group, we describe all left-invariant half-flat\nstructures and develop a method to explicitly determine the resulting parallel\nG_2- or G_2^*-structure without integrating. In particular, we construct three\neight-parameter families of metrics with holonomy equal to G_2 and G_2^*.\nMoreover, we obtain a strong rigidity result for the metrics induced by a\nhalf-flat structure (\\omega,\\rho) on H_3 \\times H_3 satisfying \\omega(Z,Z)=0\nwhere Z denotes the centre. Finally, we describe the special geometry of the\nspace of stable three-forms satisfying a reality condition.

The\ncontrast between the solute and the solvent was varied by using mixtures of\nprotonated and deuterated solvents. This allows us to investigate the partial\nstructure factors of the deuterated dendrimers in detail. An analysis of the\nmeasured scattering intensities reveals that the shape of the flexible\ndendrimers is practically independent of the concentration in contrast to the\npronounced conformational changes of flexible linear polymers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2009 15:43:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-08"}
