Simply put, DOS involves a process of joint channel probing\nand distributed scheduling for ad-hoc (peer-to-peer) communications. Since, in\npractice, link conditions are estimated with noisy observations, the\ntransmission rate has to be backed off from the estimated rate to avoid\ntransmission outages. Then, a natural question to ask is whether it is\nworthwhile for the link with successful contention to perform further channel\nprobing to mitigate estimation errors, at the cost of additional probing. Thus\nmotivated, this work investigates DOS with two-level channel probing by\noptimizing the tradeoff between the throughput gain from more accurate rate\nestimation and the resulting additional delay. Capitalizing on optimal stopping\ntheory with incomplete information, we show that the optimal scheduling policy\nis threshold-based and is characterized by either one or two thresholds,\ndepending on network settings. Necessary and sufficient conditions for both\ncases are rigorously established. In particular, our analysis reveals that\nperforming second-level channel probing is optimal when the first-level\nestimated channel condition falls in between the two thresholds. Numerical\nresults are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed DOS with\ntwo-level channel probing. We also extend our study to the case with limited\nfeedback, where the feedback from the receiver to its transmitter takes the\nform of (0,1,e).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2009 18:01:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-14"}

This map,\nwhich represents a sort of generalized KLT relation on the disk, reveals\nimportant structures between open & closed and pure open string disk\namplitudes: it relates couplings of brane and bulk string states to pure brane\ncouplings.\n  On the string world-sheet this becomes a non-trivial monodromy problem, which\nreduces the disk amplitude of N_o open and N_c closed strings to a sum of many\ncolor ordered partial subamplitudes of N_o+2N_c open strings. This sum can be\nfurther reduced to a sum over (N_o+2N_c-3)! subamplitudes of N=N_o+2N_c open\nstrings only. Hence, the computation of disk amplitudes involving open and\nclosed strings is reduced to computing these subamplitudes in the open string\nsector.\n  In this sector we find a string theory generalization and proof of the\nKleiss-Kuijf and Bern-Carrasco-Johanson relations: All order alpha' identities\nbetween open string subamplitudes are derived, which reproduce these\nfield-theory relations in the limit alpha'->0. These identities allow to reduce\nthe number of independent subamplitudes of an open string N-point amplitude to\n(N-3)!.

From observations of the bright Be-shell star zeta Tau, the\npossibly broadest and longest data set illustrating the prototype of this\nbehaviour was compiled from our own and archival observations. It comprises\noptical and infrared spectra, broad-band polarimetry, and interferometric\nobservations. From 3 V/R cycles between 1997 and 2008, a mean cycle length in H\nalpha of 1400-1430 days was derived. After each minimum in V/R, the shell\nabsorption weakens and splits into two components, leading to 3 emission peaks.\nThis phase makes the strongest contribution to the variability in cycle length.\nV/R curves of different lines are shifted in phase. Lines formed on average\ncloser to the central star are ahead of the others. The shell absorption lines\nfall into 2 categories differing in line width, ionization/excitation\npotential, and variability of the equivalent width. The interferometry has\nresolved the continuum and the line emission in Br gamma and He I 2.06. The\nphasing of the Br gamma emission shows that the photocenter of the\nline-emitting region lies within the plane of the disk but is offset from the\ncontinuum source. The plane of the disk is constant throughout the observed V/R\ncycles. The self-consistent, one-armed, disk-oscillation model is developed in\nPaper II.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2009 20:09:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

We conducted a Chandra snapshot survey of 12\nbright BAL RLQs selected from SDSS/FIRST data and possessing a wide range of\nradio and CIV absorption properties. Optical spectra were obtained nearly\ncontemporaneously with the Hobby-Eberly Telescope; no strong flux or BAL\nvariability was seen between epochs. We also include in our sample 9 additional\nBAL RLQs possessing archival Chandra coverage.

(BAL RLQs are also X-ray weak by\ntypical factors of 2.0-4.5 relative to non-BAL RLQs having both comparable\noptical/UV and radio luminosities.) However, BAL RLQs are not as X-ray weak\nrelative to non-BAL RLQs as are BAL RQQs relative to non-BAL RQQs. While some\nBAL RLQs have harder X-ray spectra than typical non-BAL RLQs, some have\nhardness ratios consistent with those of non-BAL RLQs, and there does not\nappear to be a correlation between X-ray weakness and spectral hardness, in\ncontrast to the situation for BAL RQQs. RLQs are expected to have X-ray\ncontinuum contributions from both disk-corona and small-scale jet emission.\nWhile the entire X-ray continuum in BAL RLQs cannot be obscured to the same\ndegree as in BAL RQQs, we calculate that the jet is likely partially covered in\nmany BAL RLQs.

The mathematical formulation of\nthe band gap optimization problem leads to an infinite-dimensional Hermitian\neigenvalue optimization problem parametrized by the dielectric material and the\nwave vector. To make the problem tractable, the original eigenvalue problem is\ndiscretized using the finite element method into a series of finite-dimensional\neigenvalue problems for multiple values of the wave vector parameter. The\nresulting optimization problem is large-scale and non-convex, with low\nregularity and non-differentiable objective.

Our\nCT theorem, like Viennot's lattice path theorem from which it is derived\nprimarily by a change of variable lemma, is expressed in terms of orthogonal\npolynomials which in our applications of interest often turn out to be\nnon-classical. Hence we also present an efficient method for finding explicit\nclosed form polynomial expressions for these non-classical orthogonal\npolynomials. Our method for finding the closed form polynomial expressions\nrelies on simple combinatorial manipulations of Viennot's diagrammatic\nrepresentation for orthogonal polynomials. In the course of the paper we also\nprovide a new proof of Viennot's original orthogonal polynomial lattice path\ntheorem. The new proof is of interest because it uses diagonalization of the\ntransfer matrix, but gets around difficulties that have arisen in past attempts\nto use this approach. In particular we show how to sum over a set of implicitly\ndefined zeros of a given orthogonal polynomial, either by using properties of\nresidues or by using partial fractions.

The\nlatter notion was introduced by Schnorr and is rather natural: an infinite\nbinary sequence is computably random if no total computable strategy succeeds\non it by betting on bits in order. However, computably random sequences can\nhave properties that one may consider to be incompatible with being random, in\nparticular, there are computably random sequences that are highly compressible.\nThe concept of Martin-Loef randomness is much better behaved in this and other\nrespects, on the other hand its definition in terms of martingales is\nconsiderably less natural. Muchnik, elaborating on ideas of Kolmogorov and\nLoveland, refined Schnorr's model by also allowing non-monotonic strategies,\ni.e. strategies that do not bet on bits in order. The subsequent\n``non-monotonic'' notion of randomness, now called Kolmogorov-Loveland\nrandomness, has been shown to be quite close to Martin-Loef randomness, but\nwhether these two classes coincide remains a fundamental open question. As\nsuggested by Miller and Nies, we study in this paper weak versions of\nKolmogorov-Loveland randomness, where the betting strategies are non-adaptive\n(i.e., the positions of the bits to bet on should be decided before the game).\nWe obtain a full classification of the different notions we consider.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2009 10:41:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-15"}

Increasing the packing fraction even further\nleads to a second transition, which is characterised by the development of\nlarge zones of lower and higher dynamical activity that are well separated from\neach other; the range of correlation decreases at this point. This striking\nnon-monotonic dependence of the spatial correlation length on volume fraction\nis reminiscent of the behaviour recently observed at the jamming/rigidity\ntransition in granular systems (Lechenault et al. 2008). We identify this\nsecond transition as the transition to 'squeezed' states, where the\nconstituents of the system start to exert direct contact forces on each other,\nsuch that the dynamics becomes increasingly determined by imbalanced stresses.\nEvidence of this transition is also found in the frequency dependence of the\nstorage and loss moduli, which become increasingly coupled as direct friction\nbetween the particles starts to contribute to the dissipative losses within the\nsystem.

Cells initially respond to external changes in the environment, but\nafter some time, they regain their original state. By considering an element\nconsisting of two variables that show such adaptation dynamics, we studied a\ncoupled dynamical system containing such elements to examine the diverse\ndynamics in the system and classified the behaviors on the basis of the network\nstructure that determined the interaction among elements. For a system with two\nelements, two types of behaviors, perfect adaptation and simple oscillation,\nwere observed. For a system with three elements, in addition to these two\ntypes, novel types of dynamics, namely, rapid burst-type oscillation and a slow\ncycle, were discovered; depending on the initial conditions, these novel types\nof dynamics coexisted. These behaviors are a result of the characteristic\ndynamics of each element, i.e., fast response and slow adaptation processes.\nThe behaviors depend on the network structure (in specific, a combination of\npositive or negative feedback among elements). Cooperativity among elements due\nto a positive feedback loop leads to simple oscillation, whereas frustration\ninvolving alternating positive and negative interactions among elements leads\nto the coexistence of rapid bursting oscillation and a slow cycle. These\nbehaviors are classified on the basis of the frustration indices defined by the\nnetwork structure. The period of the slow cycle is much longer than the\noriginal adaptation time scale, while the burst-type oscillation is a continued\nresponse that does not involve any adaptation. We briefly discuss the universal\napplicability of our results to a network of a larger number of elements and\ntheir possible relevance to biological systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2009 11:45:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

We formulate a\nsystematic procedure for designing DM tradeoff optimal codes for general\nselective-fading MIMO channels by demonstrating that the design problem can be\nseparated into two simpler and independent problems: the design of an inner\ncode, or precoder, adapted to the channel statistics (i.e., the selectivity\ncharacteristics) and an outer code independent of the channel statistics. Our\nresults are supported by appealing geometric intuition, first pointed out for\nthe flat-fading case by Zheng and Tse, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 2003.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2009 15:57:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-15"}

Several mechanisms, including minor mergers,\nhave been proposed for increasing galaxy sizes from high- to low-z. We search\nfor superdense massive galaxies in the WIde-field Nearby Galaxy-cluster Survey\n(WINGS) of X-ray selected galaxy clusters at 0.04<z<0.07. We discover a\nsignificant population of superdense massive galaxies with masses and sizes\ncomparable to those observed at high redshift. They approximately represent 22%\nof all cluster galaxies more massive than 3x10^10Msol, are mostly S0 galaxies,\nhave a median effective radius <Re> =1.61+/-0.29kpc, a median Sersic index <n>\n= 3.0+/-0.6, and very old stellar populations with a median mass-weighted age\nof 12.1+/-1.3Gyr. We calculate a number density of 2.9x10^-2Mpc^-3 for\nsuperdense galaxies in local clusters, and a hard lower limit of\n1.3x10^-5Mpc^-3 in the whole comoving volume between z = 0.04 and z = 0.07. We\nfind a relation between mass, effective radius and luminosity-weighted age in\nour cluster galaxies, which can mimic the claimed evolution of the radius with\nredshift, if not properly taken into account. We compare our data with\nspectroscopic high-z surveys and find that -when stellar masses are considered-\nthere is consistency with the local WINGS galaxy sizes out to z~2, while a\ndiscrepancy of a factor of 3 exists with the only spectroscopic z>2 study. In\ncontrast, there is strong evidence for a large evolution in radius for the most\nmassive galaxies with M*>4x10^11Msol compared to similarly massive galaxies in\nWINGS, i.e. the BCGs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2009 15:57:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2009 13:03:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2010 12:42:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-04"}
