If it is to preserve supersymmetry, the\nmembrane background must obey certain conditions. These conditions are\nexpressed as geometrical constraints on differential forms and as such, can be\ninterpreted as calibrations. Knowing the complete set of calibrations is the\nsame as satisfying all conditions needed for supersymmetry preservation. While\na purely geometric background is completely specified through standard\ncalibrations, in order to fully describe a flux background, we must also state\nits generalized calibrations. These can be found by probing the background with\nBPS branes. The logic is simple. Since a BPS probe is guaranteed to be stable,\nwe require that its volume be given by a calibrated form. This applies equally\nto both charged and uncharged probes; the former are stabilized by flux whereas\nthe latter achieve stability by minimizing their volumes. Volume-forms of\ncharged probes correspond to generalized calibrations and those of uncharged\nprobes, to standard calibrations. Previously geometries were probed only by\nuncharged branes. The calibrations that were found had then to be supplemented\nby additional conditions in order to guarantee supersymmetry preservation in\nbackgrounds with flux. Once the scope is broadened to include charged branes,\nthe 'missing conditions' (generalized calibrations) can also be recovered using\nthe probe analysis. We use this method to classify the backgrounds of wrapped\nM2-branes embedded in Calabi-Yau manifolds by specifying their calibrations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2009 19:16:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-13"}

It has been suggested that convection in Red Supergiant (RSG) stars\ngives rise to large-scale granules causing observable surface inhomogeneities.\nThis convection is also extremely vigorous, and suspected to be one of the\ncauses of mass-loss in RSGs. It must thus be understood in details. Evidence\nhas been accumulated that there are asymmetries in the photospheres of RSGs,\nbut detailedstudies of granulation are still lacking.

Feedback resources are shared and are\nopportunistically accessed by users who are strong, i.e. users whose channel\nquality information is above a certain fixed threshold. Strong users send same\nfeedback information on all shared channels. They are identified by the base\nstation via compressive sensing. Both analog and digital feedbacks are\nconsidered. The proposed analog & digital opportunistic feedback schemes are\nshown to achieve the same sum-rate throughput as that achieved by dedicated\nfeedback schemes, but with feedback channels growing only logarithmically with\nnumber of users. Moreover, there is also a reduction in the feedback load. In\nthe analog feedback case, we show that the propose scheme reduces the feedback\nnoise which eventually results in better throughput, whereas in the digital\nfeedback case the proposed scheme in a noisy scenario achieves almost the\nthroughput obtained in a noiseless dedicated feedback scenario. We also show\nthat for a fixed given budget of feedback bits, there exist a trade-off between\nthe number of shared channels and thresholds accuracy of the feedback SINR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2009 19:29:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

A number of techniques are presently used to develop such\nreduced-order models, such as proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), and\napproximate snapshot-based balanced truncation, also known as balanced POD.\nEach method has its strengths and weaknesses: for instance, POD models can\nbehave unpredictably and perform poorly, but they can be computed directly from\nexperimental data; approximate balanced truncation often produces vastly\nsuperior models to POD, but requires data from adjoint simulations, and thus\ncannot be applied to experimental data.\n  In this paper, we show that using the Eigensystem Realization Algorithm (ERA)\n\\citep{JuPa-85}, one can theoretically obtain exactly the same reduced order\nmodels as by balanced POD. Moreover, the models can be obtained directly from\nexperimental data, without the use of adjoint information. The algorithm can\nalso substantially improve computational efficiency when forming reduced-order\nmodels from simulation data. If adjoint information is available, then balanced\nPOD has some advantages over ERA: for instance, it produces modes that are\nuseful for multiple purposes, and the method has been generalized to unstable\nsystems. We also present a modified ERA procedure that produces modes without\nadjoint information, but for this procedure, the resulting models are not\nbalanced, and do not perform as well in examples.

Aims: Our goal was to\ndetect p-mode oscillations in the metal-poor sub-dwarf 85 Peg A and to search\nfor other variability on longer timescales. Methods: We have obtained\ncontinuous high-precision photometry of the binary system 85 Pegasi with the\nMOST space telescope in two seasons (2005 & 2007). Furthermore, we redetermined\nvsini for 85 Peg A using high resolution spectra obtained through the ESO\narchive, and used photometric spot modeling to interpret long periodic\nvariations. Results: Our frequency analysis yields no convincing evidence for\np-modes significantly above a noise level of 4 ppm. Using simulated p-mode\npatterns we provide upper RMS amplitude limits for 85 Peg A. The light curve\nshows evidence for variability with a period of about 11 d and this periodicity\nis also seen in the follow up run in 2007; however, as different methods to\nremove instrumental trends in the 2005 run yield vastly different results, the\nexact shape and periodicity of the 2005 variability remain uncertain.

Using these values in\ncombination with simple photometric spot models we are able to reconstruct the\nobserved variations. Conclusions: The null-detection of p-modes in 85 Peg A is\nconsistent with theoretical values for pulsation amplitudes in this star. The\ndetected long-periodic variation must await confirmation by further\nobservations with similar or better precision and long-term stability. If the\n11 d periodicity is real, rotational modulation of surface features on one of\nthe components is the most likely explanation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Jul 2009 00:16:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

This was argued to\njustify entanglement survival in the fermionic case in the SMA infinite\nacceleration limit. Here we relax SMA. Hence, an infinite number of modes are\nexcited as the observer Rob accelerates, even for a fermion field. We will\nprove that, despite this analogy with the bosonic case, entanglement loss is\nlimited. We will show that this comes from fermionic statistics through the\ncharacteristic structure it imposes on the infinite dimensional density matrix\nfor Rob. Surprisingly, the surviving entanglement is independent of the\nspecific maximally entangled state chosen, the kind of fermionic field\nanalyzed, and the number of accessible modes considered. We shall discuss\nwhether this surviving entanglement goes beyond the purely statistical\ncorrelations, giving insight concerning the black hole information paradox.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Jul 2009 12:22:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2009 08:53:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 2009 12:16:21 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2009 19:29:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

This concept was originally applied to plant or\ncrop growth (Justus von Liebig, 1840) and quantitatively supported by many\nexperiments. Some generalizations based on more complicated \"dose-response\"\ncurves were proposed. Violations of this law in natural and experimental\necosystems were also reported. We study models of adaptation in ensembles of\nsimilar organisms under load of environmental factors and prove that violation\nof Liebig's law follows from adaptation effects. If the fitness of an organism\nin a fixed environment satisfies the Law of the Minimum then adaptation\nequalizes the pressure of essential factors and therefore acts against the\nLiebig's law. This is the the Law of the Minimum paradox: if for a randomly\nchosen pair \"organism-environment\" the Law of the Minimum typically holds,\nthen, in a well-adapted system, we have to expect violations of this law.\n  For the opposite interaction of factors (a synergistic system of factors\nwhich amplify each other) adaptation leads from factor equivalence to\nlimitations by a smaller number of factors.\n  For analysis of adaptation we develop a system of models based on Selye's\nidea of the universal adaptation resource (adaptation energy). These models\npredict that under the load of an environmental factor a population separates\ninto two groups (phases): a less correlated, well adapted group and a highly\ncorrelated group with a larger variance of attributes, which experiences\nproblems with adaptation.
