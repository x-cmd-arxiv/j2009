The result is a model-independent\nexpression relating CP violation in mixing, CP violation in the interference of\ndecays with and without mixing, and the meson mass and width differences. It\nrelates the semileptonic and time-dependent CP asymmetries; and CP-conjugate\npairs of time-dependent $D^0$ CP asymmetries. CP violation in the interference\nof decays with and without mixing is related to the mixing parameters of\nrelevance to model building: the off-diagonal mixing matrix elements |M12|,\n|Gamma12|, and phi12 = arg(M12 /Gamma12). Incorporating this relation into a\nfit to the D0 -\\overline{D0} mixing data implies a level of sensitivity to\n|phiD12| of 0.10 [rad] at 1 sigma. The formalism is extended to include new\nweak phases in decay, and in Gamma12. The phases are highly constrained by\ndirect CP violation measurements. Consequently, the bounds on |phiD12| are not\nsignificantly altered, and the effects of new weak phases in decay could be\ndifficult to observe at a high luminosity flavor factory (D0) or at the LHC\n(Bs) via violations of the above relations, unlike in direct CP violation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 2009 17:21:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-05"}

We conclude that existing experiments constrain\nany such asymmetry to be less than about 10^-7. First we consider contributions\nto the inertial masses of atoms that encode the presence of antimatter and use\nprecision Eotvos experiments to establish the level at which they satisfy the\nequivalence principle. In particular we focus on vacuum polarization effects\nand the antiquark content of nucleons. Second we consider a class of theories\nthat contain long range scalar and vector forces that cancel with one another\nto some high precision. By construction such theories would be able to evade\ndetection in Eotvos experiments that utilize matter while still allowing for a\nsignal in antimatter experiments. Even taking such cancellation for granted,\nhowever, we show that the radiative damping of binary pulsar systems constrains\nthese forces to be significantly weaker than gravity. Furthermore we show that\nthere are limits to the accuracy with which such cancellation can be arranged:\nfirst by determining the precision to which scalar charges can track vector\ncharges in the best candidate theories; and, second, by showing that the\ndifferent velocity dependence of scalar and vector forces necessarily\nintroduces non-cancellation at a quantifiable level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 2009 19:11:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-24"}

The two-loop bubble diagram contains a linear infrared\ndivergence. Even if regulated with a non-zero photon mass M of order of the\nDebye mass, this infrared sensitivity implies that the two-loop self-energy\ncontributes terms to the fermion dispersion relation that are comparable to or\neven larger than the next-to-leading-order (NLO) contributions at one-loop.\nAdditional evidence for the necessity of a systematic restructuring of the loop\nexpansion comes from the explicit gauge parameter dependence of the fermion\ndamping rate at both one and two-loops. The leading terms in the high\ntemperature expansion of the two-loop self-energy for all topologies arise from\nan explicit hard-soft factorization pattern, in which one of the loop integrals\nis hard, nested inside a second loop integral which is soft. There are no\nhard-hard contributions to the two-loop Sigma at leading order at high T.\nProvided the same factorization pattern holds for arbitrary ell loops, the NLO\nhigh temperature contributions to the electron self-energy come from ell-1 hard\nloops factorized with one soft loop integral. This hard-soft pattern is both a\nnecessary condition for the resummation over ell to coincide with the one-loop\nself-energy calculated with HTL dressed propagators and vertices, and to yield\nthe complete NLO correction to the self-energy at scales ~eT, which is both\ninfrared finite and gauge invariant.

The FIR-radio correlation is caused by a combination of the\nefficient cooling of CR electrons (calorimetry) in starbursts and a conspiracy\nof several factors.

Our mechanisms are surprisingly simple: We show that a\nsequential all-pay mechanism is a 4 approximation to the revenue of the optimal\nex-interim truthful mechanism with discrete correlated type space for each\nbidder. We also show that a sequential posted price mechanism is a O(1)\napproximation to the revenue of the optimal ex-post truthful mechanism when the\ntype space of each bidder is a product distribution that satisfies the standard\nhazard rate condition. We further show a logarithmic approximation when the\nhazard rate condition is removed, and complete the picture by showing that\nachieving a sub-logarithmic approximation, even for regular distributions and\none bidder, requires pricing bundles of items.

The\ngraphitization of hexagonal SiC surfaces provides a viable alternative for the\nsynthesis of graphene, with wafer-size epitaxial graphene on SiC(0001) now\npossible. Despite this recent progress, the exact nature of the graphene-SiC\ninterface and whether the graphene even has a semiconducting gap remain\ncontroversial. Using scanning tunneling microscopy with functionalized tips and\ndensity functional theory calculations, here we show that the interface is a\nwarped carbon sheet consisting of three-fold hexagon-pentagon-heptagon\ncomplexes periodically inserted into the honeycomb lattice. These defects\nrelieve the strain between the graphene layer and the SiC substrate, while\nstill retaining the three-fold coordination for each carbon atom. Moreover,\nthese defects break the six-fold symmetry of the honeycomb, thereby naturally\ninducing a gap: the calculated band structure of the interface is\nsemiconducting and there are two localized states near K below the Fermi level,\nexplaining the photoemission and carbon core-level data. Nonlinear dispersion\nand a 33 meV gap are found at the Dirac point for the next layer of graphene,\nproviding insights into the debate over the origin of the gap in epitaxial\ngraphene on SiC(0001).

Their unique electromagnetic properties were\ncharacterized by the effective media theory at the early stage. However, the\neffective media model does not take into account the interactions between\nmagnetic elements; thus, the effective properties of bulk metamaterials are the\nresult of the \"averaged effect\" of many uncoupled resonators. In recent years,\nit has been shown that the interaction between magnetic resonators could lead\nto some novel phenomena and interesting applications that do not exist in\nconventional uncoupled metamaterials. In this paper, we will give a review of\nrecent developments in magnetic plasmonics arising from the coupling effect in\nmetamaterials. For the system composed of several identical magnetic\nresonators, the coupling between these units produces multiple discrete\nresonance modes due to hybridization. In the case of a system comprising an\ninfinite number of magnetic elements, these multiple discrete resonances can be\nextended to form a continuous frequency band by strong coupling. This kind of\nbroadband and tunable magnetic metamaterial may have interesting applications.\nMany novel metamaterials and nanophotonic devices could be developed from\ncoupled resonator systems in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 2009 03:09:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2009 12:18:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

This method can be applied to a four\ndimensional manifold of orbits in spacetime associated with a relativistic\nsystem. We show that a relativistic Hamiltonian which generates Einstein\ngeodesics, with the addition of a world scalar field, can be put into\ncorrespondence with another Hamiltonian with conformally modified metric. Such\na construction could account for part of the requirements of Bekenstein for\nachieving the MOND theory of Milgrom in the post-Newtonian limit. The\nconstraints on the MOND theory imposed by the galactic rotation curves, through\nthis correspondence, would then imply constraints on the structure of the world\nscalar field. We then use the fact that a Hamiltonian with vector gauge fields\nresults, through such a conformal map, in a Kaluza-Klein type theory, and\nindicate how the TeVeS structure of Bekenstein and Sanders can be put into this\nframework.

We adopt a widely used approach in packet switching\nsystems to decompose the multi-queue system into independent first-in-first-out\n(FIFO) queues, which are hinged together by the probability of success of\nhead-of-line (HOL) packets. A unified method is devised to tackle the stability\nand throughput problems of K-Exponential Backoff with any cutoff phase K.

At a presumed age of\n~3 Myr, NGC7129 is in the critical range where disks around young stars\ndisappear. We make use of Chandra X-ray and Spitzer and 2MASS IR imaging\nobservations to identify the pre-main sequence stars in NGC7129. We define a\nsample of Young Stellar Objects based on color-color diagrams composed from IR\nphotometry between 1.6 and 8 mu, from 2MASS and Spitzer, and based on X-ray\ndetected sources from a Chandra observation. This sample is composed of 26\nClass II and 25 Class III candidates. The sample is estimated to be complete\ndown to ~ 0.5 solar masses. The most restricted and least biased sub-sample of\npre-main sequence stars is composed of lightly absorbed (A_V < 5 mag) stars in\nthe cluster core. This sample comprises 7 Class II and 14 Class III sources, it\nhas a disk fraction of 33^{+24}_{-19} %, and a median X-ray luminosity of log\n(L_x) [erg/s] = 30.3. Despite the various uncertainties related to the sample\nselection, absorption, mass distribution, distance and, consequently, the\ncomputation of disk fraction and X-ray luminosities, the data yield consistent\nresults.

Cooling cores in the centers are interesting laboratories to\ninvestigate the interplay between gas cooling, star- and black hole formation\nand energy feedback, which is diagnosed by means of X-ray spectroscopy.

Quantum effects, playing the essential role\nat the very early stages, suggests that the universe may follow different\ncourse to that presented by the standard Friedmann solutions. The investigation\nof the back-reaction effect of the vacuum energy of quantized massless matter\nfields at finite temperatures shows that the original spatial singularity is\navoided and that the universe is maintained all times at a critical density.\nInstead of having a universe that was created at once we have an emergent\nuniverse with energy being created continuously so as to maintain the overall\ndensity at its critical value. The calculations presented here provide a basis\nto construct a dynamical model for the universe where all the known problems of\nthe standard big bang can be avioded from start without the need to assume the\noccurence of an inflation phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 2009 13:19:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-27"}

The observations were conducted with the Parkes\n64m radio telescope, in a single-pixel pointed mode, reaching an rms noise\nlevel of typically 2-6 mJy over the velocity search range of 400<v<10500km/s. A\ntotal of 162 galaxies were detected. This can be explained by the prominence of\nthe GA overdensity in the survey regions, which leads to a relatively higher\nfraction of nearby galaxies. It is also evident from the quite narrow velocity\ndistribution (largely confined to 3000-6000km/s) and deviates significantly\nfrom the expectation of a uniform galaxy distribution for the given sensitivity\nand velocity range. No systematic differences were found between detections and\nnon-detections, in terms of latitude, foreground extinction, or environment,\nexcept for the very central part of the rich Norma cluster, where hardly any\ngalaxies were detected. A detailed investigation of the HI content of the\ngalaxies reveals strong HI deficiency at the core of the Norma cluster (within\nabout a 0.4 Abell radius), similar to what has been found in the Coma cluster.\nThe redshifts obtained by this observing technique result in a substantial\nreduction of the so-called redshift ZOA. This is obvious when analysing the\nlarge-scale structure of the new HI data in combination with data from optical\nZOA redshift surveys. The lower latitude detections provide further evidence of\nthe extension of the Norma Wall, across the ZOA, in particular its bending\ntowards the Cen-Crux clusters above the Galactic plane at slightly higher\nredshift, rather than a straight continuation towards the Centaurus clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 2009 15:16:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}
