To this end, we apply a simulated\nannealing algorithm to maximize the dark energy information at fixed\nobservational cost, and find that optimal follow-up strategies can reduce the\nobservational cost required to achieve a specified precision by up to an order\nof magnitude. Considering clusters selected from optical imaging in the Dark\nEnergy Survey, we find that approximately 200 low-redshift X-ray clusters or\nmassive Sunyaev-Zel'dovich clusters can improve the dark energy figure of merit\nby 50%, provided that the follow-up mass measurements involve no systematic\nerror. In practice, the actual improvement depends on (1) the uncertainty in\nthe systematic error in follow-up mass measurements, which needs to be\ncontrolled at the 5% level to avoid severe degradation of the results; and (2)\nthe scatter in the optical richness-mass distribution, which needs to be made\nas tight as possible to improve the efficacy of follow-up observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2009 19:29:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Apr 2010 17:42:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

In this paper we extend Delzant's\nclassification to non-compact symplectic toric manifolds. For a non-compact\nsymplectic toric manifold the image of the moment map need not be convex and\nthe induced map on the quotient need not be an embedding. Moreover, even when\nthe map on the quotient is an embedding, its image no longer determines the\nsymplectic toric manifold; a degree two characteristic class on the quotient\nmakes an appearance. Nevertheless, the quotient is a manifold with corners, and\nthe induced map from the quotient to the dual of the Lie algebra is what we\ncall a unimodular local embedding. We classify non-compact symplectic toric\nmanifolds in terms of manifolds with corners equipped with degree two\ncohomology classes and unimodular local embeddings into the dual of the Lie\nalgebra of the corresponding torus. The main new ingredient is the construction\nof a symplectic toric manifold from such data. The proof passes through an\nequivalence of categories between symplectic toric manifolds and symplectic\ntoric bundles over a fixed unimodular local embedding. This equivalence also\ngives a geometric interpretation of the degree two cohomology class.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2009 17:16:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 May 2010 22:34:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 Aug 2014 21:28:24 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2015 04:39:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-23"}

If only small portions of the sky are\nconsidered, it is often desirable to perform the analysis in the flat-sky\nlimit. We aim at a formal, detailed derivation of the bispectrum covariance in\nthe flat-sky approximation, focusing on a pure two-dimensional Fourier-plane\napproach. We define an unbiased estimator of the bispectrum, which takes the\naverage over the overlap of annuli in Fourier space, and compute its full\ncovariance. The outcome of our formalism is compared to the flat-sky spherical\nharmonic approximation in terms of the covariance, the behavior under parity\ntransformations, and the information content. We introduce a geometrical\ninterpretation of the averaging process in the estimator, thus providing an\nintuitive understanding. Contrary to foregoing work, we find a difference by a\nfactor of two between the covariances of the Fourier-plane and the spherical\nharmonic approach. We argue that this discrepancy can be explained by the\ndiffering behavior with respect to parity. However, in an exemplary analysis it\nis demonstrated that the Fisher information of both formalisms agrees to high\naccuracy.

This explains the ubiquity of the log-normal PDF in many different\nnumerical simulations. We also show that subsequent interaction with a\nspherical blast wave generates a power-law density distribution at high\ndensities, qualitatively similar to the Salpeter power-law for the IMF.\nFinally, we show that a focused shock produces a downstream flow with energy\nspectrum exponent \\alpha=-2. Subsequent shock passages reduce this slope,\nachieving \\alpha \\approx -5/3 after a few passages. Subsequent dissipation of\nenergy piled up at the small scales will act to maintain the spectrum very near\nto the Kolomogorov value. Therefore, fully-developed turbulence may not be\nrequired to explain the observed energy spectrum and density PDF. We argue that\nthe self-similar spherical blast wave arising from expanding HII regions or\nstellar winds from massive stars may ultimately be responsible for creating the\nhigh mass, power-law, tail in the IMF.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2009 19:19:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The direct detection with VISIR\nat the ESO-VLT of the 7 kpc distant companion galaxy of HE0450-2958 allows us\nto spatially separate the sites of quasar and star formation activity in this\ncomposite system made of two ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs).

Our approach is based on a dual\napplication of the so-called diffusion canonical transformation method that\ncombines smooth monotonic mappings and measure changes via Doob-h transforms.\nThis gives rise to new multi-parameter solvable diffusions that are generally\ndivided into two main classes; the first is specified by having affine (linear)\ndrift with various resulting nonlinear diffusion coefficient functions, while\nthe second class allows for several specifications of a (generally nonlinear)\ndiffusion coefficient with resulting nonlinear drift function.

These object are luminous enough in the thermal infrared to be\nobservable with current and next generation optical/IR telescopes, provided\nthat the atmosphere of the forming planet permits astronomers to observe\nbrightness temperatures approaching that of the molten surface. Detectability\nof a collisional afterglow depends on properties of the planet's atmosphere --\nprimarily on the mass of the atmosphere. A planet with a thin atmosphere is\nmore readily detected, because there is little atmosphere to obscure the hot\nsurface. Paradoxically, a more massive atmosphere prevents one from easily\nseeing the hot surface, but also keeps the planet hot for a longer time. In\nterms of planetary mass, more massive planets are also easier to detect than\nsmaller ones because of their larger emitting surface areas. We present\npreliminary calculations assuming a range of protoplanet masses (1-10\n$M_\\earth$), surface pressures (1-1000 bar), and atmospheric compositions, for\nmolten planets with surface temperatures ranging from 1000 to 1800 K, in order\nto explore the diversity of emergent spectra that are detectable.

Taking a stream-computing\nperspective, we can think of each user's performance profile as a stream of\nnumbers (such as response times), and the aggregate performance profile of the\nshared infrastructure as a \"braid\" of these intermixed streams. The monitoring\nsystem's goal then is to untangle this braid sufficiently to track the top k\noutliers. This paper investigates the space complexity of one-pass algorithms\nfor approximating outliers of this kind, proves lower bounds using multi-party\ncommunication complexity, and proposes small-memory heuristic algorithms. On\none hand, stream outliers are easily tracked for simple measures, such as max\nor min, but our theoretical results rule out even good approximations for most\nof the natural measures such as average, median, or the quantiles.

We use radial velocities obtained from VLT spectral\nobservations and MACHO and OGLE light curves to examine properties of the stars\nand to evaluate models for the cause of LSPs. This sample is much larger than\nthe combined previous studies of Hinkle et al. (2002) and Wood, Olivier &\nKawaler (2004). Binary and pulsation models have enjoyed much support in recent\nyears. Assuming stellar pulsation, we calculate from the velocity curves that\nthe typical fractional radius change over an LSP cycle is greater than 30 per\ncent. This should lead to large changes in Teff that are not observed. Also,\nthe small light amplitude of these stars seems inconsistent with the radius\namplitude. We conclude that pulsation is not a likely explanation for the LSPs.\nThe main alternative, physical movement of the star -- binary motion -- also\nhas severe problems. If the velocity variations are due to binary motion, the\ndistribution of the angle of periastron in our large sample of stars has a\nprobability of 1.4e-3 that it comes from randomly aligned binary orbits. In\naddition, we calculate a typical companion mass of 0.09 Msun. Less than 1 per\ncent of low mass main sequence stars have companions near this mass (0.06 to\n0.12 Msun) whereas ~25 to 50 per cent of low mass red giants end up with LSPs.\nWe are unable to find a suitable model for the LSPs and conclude by listing\ntheir known properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2009 04:28:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

We discuss how to incorporate a global symmetry, given\nby a compact, completely reducible group G, in tensor network decompositions\nand algorithms. This is achieved by considering tensors that are invariant\nunder the action of the group G. Each symmetric tensor decomposes into two\ntypes of tensors: degeneracy tensors, containing all the degrees of freedom,\nand structural tensors, which only depend on the symmetry group. In numerical\ncalculations, the use of symmetric tensors ensures the preservation of the\nsymmetry, allows selection of a specific symmetry sector, and significantly\nreduces computational costs. On the other hand, the resulting tensor network\ncan be interpreted as a superposition of exponentially many spin networks. Spin\nnetworks are used extensively in loop quantum gravity, where they represent\nstates of quantum geometry. Our work highlights their importance also in the\ncontext of tensor network algorithms, thus setting the stage for\ncross-fertilization between these two areas of research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2009 06:54:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 2010 23:22:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-19"}

The asymmetry is related to the synchronous\nrotation of the Moon: there is a higher density of rayed craters on the leading\nhemisphere compared with the trailing hemisphere. Rayed craters represent\ngenerally the youngest impacts. The purpose of this paper is to test the\nhypotheses that (i) the population of Near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) is the source\nof the impactors that have made the rayed craters, and (ii) that impacts by\nthis projectile population account quantitatively for the observed asymmetry.\nWe carried out numerical simulations of the orbital evolution of a large number\nof test particles representing NEAs in order to determine directly their impact\nflux on the Moon. The simulations were done in two stages. In the first stage\nwe obtained encounter statistics of NEAs on the Earth's activity sphere. In the\nsecond stage we calculated the direct impact flux of the encountering particles\non the surface of the Moon; the latter calculations were confined within the\nactivity sphere of the Earth. A steady-state synthetic population of NEAs was\ngenerated from a debiased orbital distribution of the known NEAs. We find that\nthe near-Earth asteroids do have an asymmetry in their impact flux on the Moon:\napex-to-antapex ratio of 1.32 +/- 0.01. However, the observed rayed crater\ndistribution's asymmetry is significantly more pronounced: apex-to-antapex\nratio of 1.65 +/- 0.16.

Conclusions: Under the influence of expanding\nbubbles, star formation occurs in the infrared dark areas at the border of HII\nregions and infrared bubbles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2009 09:57:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-20"}

By employing a mixed basis involving cluster sites and bath\nmolecular orbitals for the projection of the lattice Green's function onto 2x2\nclusters, a considerably more accurate description of the low frequency\nproperties of the self-energy is achieved than in a pure site picture. The\ntransition from Fermi-liquid to non-Fermi-liquid behavior for decreasing hole\ndoping is studied as a function of Coulomb energy, next-nearest neighbor\nhopping, and temperature. In particular, the self-energy component Sigma_X\nassociated with X=(pi,0) is shown to exhibit an onset of non-Fermi-liquid\nbehavior as the hole doping decreases below a critical value delta_c. The\nimaginary part of Sigma_X(omega) then develops a collective mode above E_F,\nwhich exhibits a distinct dispersion with doping. Accordingly, the real part of\nSigma_X(omega) has a positive slope above E_F, giving rise to an increasing\nparticle-hole asymmetry as the system approaches the Mott transition. This\nbehavior is consistent with the removal of spectral weight from electron states\nclose to E_F and the opening of a pseudogap which increases with decreasing\ndoping. The phase diagram reveals that delta_c = 0.15 ... 0.20 for various\nsystem parameters. For electron doping, the collective mode of Sigma_X(omega)\nand the concomitant pseudogap are located below the Fermi energy which is\nconsistent the removal of spectral weight from hole states just below E_F. The\ncritical doping which marks the onset of non-Fermi-liquid behavior, is\nsystematically smaller than for hole doping.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2009 12:39:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-29"}

On\nthe positive side, they show the existence of polynomial-sized brambles of the\norder of the square root of the treewidth, up to log factors. We provide the\nfirst polynomial time algorithm to construct a bramble in general graphs and\nachieve this bound, up to log-factors. We use this algorithm to construct\ngrid-like minors, a replacement structure for grid-minors recently introduced\nby Reed and Wood, in polynomial time. Using the grid-like minors, we introduce\nthe notion of a perfect bramble and an algorithm to find one in polynomial\ntime.

The most notable conclusion is that the detection of regular galaxies\n(i.e. no AGN, no massive SB) at high z>7 in CO-emission will be dramatically\nhindered by the weak contrast against the CMB, in contradiction to earlier\nclaims that CMB-heating will ease the detection of high-redshift CO. The full\nsimulation of extragalactic CO-lines and the predicted CO-LFs at any redshift\ncan be accessed online, prior registration required} and they should be useful\nfor the modeling of CO-line surveys with future telescopes, such as ALMA, the\nLMT, or the SKA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2009 15:17:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2013 01:36:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-02"}

The set A is said to percolate if eventually all vertices\nare infected. Our aim is to understand this process on the grid, [n]^d, for\narbitrary functions n = n(t), d = d(t) and r = r(t), as t -> infinity. The main\nquestion is to determine the critical probability p_c([n]^d,r) at which\npercolation becomes likely, and to give bounds on the size of the critical\nwindow. In this paper we study this problem when r = 2, for all functions n and\nd satisfying d \\gg log n.\n  The bootstrap process has been extensively studied on [n]^d when d is a fixed\nconstant and 2 \\leq r \\leq d, and in these cases p_c([n]^d,r) has recently been\ndetermined up to a factor of 1 + o(1) as n -> infinity. At the other end of the\nscale, Balogh and Bollobas determined p_c([2]^d,2) up to a constant factor, and\nBalogh, Bollobas and Morris determined p_c([n]^d,d) asymptotically if d > (log\nlog n)^{2+\\eps}, and gave much sharper bounds for the hypercube.\n  Here we prove the following result: let \\lambda be the smallest positive root\nof the equation \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k \\lambda^k / (2^{k^2-k} k!) = 0, so\n\\lambda \\approx 1.166.

It is located at the site of the KASCADE-Grande experiment at\nForschungszentrum Karlsruhe and measures the radio emission of cosmic ray air\nshowers in the frequency band from 40 to 80 MHz. LOPES is triggered by KASCADE\nand uses the KASCADE reconstruction of the shower axis as an input for the\nanalysis of the radio pulses. Thereby LOPES works as an interferometer when the\nsignal of all antennas is digitally merged to form a beam into the shower\ndirection. To be sensitive to the coherence of the radio signal, a precise time\ncalibration with an accuracy in the order of 1 ns is required. Thus, it is\nnecessary to know the delay of each antenna which is time and frequency\ndependent. Several calibration measurements are performed to correct for this\ndelay in the analysis: The group delay of every antenna is measured regularly\n(roughly once per year) by recording a test pulse which is emitted at a known\ntime. Furthermore, the delay is monitored continuously by the so called phase\ncalibration method: A beacon (a dipole antenna) emits continuously two sine\nwaves at 63.5 MHz and 68.1 MHz. By that a variation of the delay can be\ndetected in a subsequent analysis of the radio events as a change of the phase\nat these frequencies. Finally, the dispersion of the analog electronics has\nbeen measured to account for the frequency dependence of the delay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2009 15:35:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-13"}
