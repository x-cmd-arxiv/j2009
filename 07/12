It has been introduced by K.\nCieliebak and U. Frauenfelder. Together with A. Oancea, the same authors have\nrecently computed the Rabinowitz-Floer homology of the cotangent disk bundle\nD^*M of a closed manifold M, by establishing a long exact sequence. The first\naim of this paper is to present a chain level construction of this exact\nsequence. In fact, we show that this sequence is the long homology sequence\ninduced by a short exact sequence of chain complexes, which involves the Morse\nchain complex and the Morse differential complex of the energy functional for\nclosed geodesics on M. These chain maps are defined by considering spaces of\nsolutions of the Rabinowitz-Floer equation on half-cylinders, with suitable\nboundary conditions which couple them with the negative gradient flow of the\ngeodesic energy functional. The second aim is to generalize this construction\nto the case of a fiberwise uniformly convex compact subset W of T^*M whose\ninterior part contains a Lagrangian graph. Equivalently, W is the energy\nsublevel associated to an arbitrary Tonelli Lagrangian L on TM and to any\nenergy level which is larger than the strict Mane' critical value of L. In this\ncase, the energy functional for closed geodesics is replaced by the free period\nLagrangian action functional associated to a suitable calibration of L. An\nimportant issue in our analysis is to extend the uniform estimates for the\nsolutions of the Rabinowitz-Floer equation to Hamiltonians which have quadratic\ngrowth in the momenta.

Each component particle contributes an\nindependent local tendency along the direction of steepest increase of the\nlocally perceived entropy at constant locally perceived energy. It conserves\nboth the locally-perceived energies and the overall energy, and meets strong\nseparability and non-signaling conditions, even though the local evolutions are\nnot independent of existing correlations.

Since this galaxy has\na large inclination, it is easy to observe its galactic wind. We produced the\nHa, [N II]6583, and [S II]6716,6731 images, as well as those line ratio maps.\nThe [N II]/Ha ratio in the galactic wind region is larger than those in H II\nregions in the galactic disk. The [N II]/Ha ratio in the southeastern filament,\na part of the galactic wind, is the largest and reaches about 1.5. These large\n[N II]/Ha ratios are explained by shock ionization/excitation. Using the [S\nII]/Ha ratio map, we spatially separate the galactic wind region from the\nstarburst region. The kinetic energy of the galactic wind can be sufficiently\nsupplied by supernovae in a starburst region in the galactic center. The shape\nof the galactic wind and the line ratio maps are non-axisymmetric about the\ngalactic minor axis, which is also seen in M82.

It has been widely observed, in\nexperiments in Josephson-junctions, photonic crystals, etc., as well as in\nsimulations, that the ratchet current induced by this force has the shape\n$v\\propto\\epsilon_1^p\\epsilon_2^q\\cos(p \\phi_{1} - q \\phi_{2} + \\theta_0)$ for\nsmall amplitudes, where $\\theta_0$ depends on the damping ($\\theta_0=\\pi/2$ if\nthere is no damping, and $\\theta_0=0$ for overdamped systems).
