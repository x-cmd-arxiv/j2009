We consider this QET protocol for N\nmassless fields in near-horizon regions of large-mass black holes with\nnear-horizon geometry described by the Minkowski metric. For each field, a\ntwo-level spin is strongly coupled with the local quantum fluctuation outside\nthe horizon during a short time period. After the measurement of N fields,\nN-bit information is obtained. During the measurement, positive-energy wave\npackets of the fields form and then fall into the black hole. The amount of\nexcitation energy is independent of the measurement result. After absorption of\nthe wave packets and increase of the black hole mass, a\nmeasurement-result-dependent local operation of the N fields is performed\noutside the horizon. Then, accompanying the extraction of positive energy from\nthe quantum fluctuation by the operation, negative-energy wave packets of the\nfields form and then fall into the black hole, decreasing the black hole mass.\nThis implies that a part of the absorbed positive energy emitted from the\nmeasurement devices is effectively retrieved from the black hole via the\nmeasurement results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2009 06:58:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2010 22:39:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2010 06:33:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-29"}

Methods: We used the\nnew generation spectropolarimeters ESPaDOnS and NARVAL to observe and detect\ncircular polarization within the photospheric absorption lines of Pollux. Our\nobservations span 18 months from 2007-2009. We treated the spectropolarimetric\ndata using the Least-Squares Deconvolution method to create high\nsignal-to-noise ratio mean Stokes V profiles. We also measured the classical\nactivity indicator S-index for the Ca H&K lines, and the stellar radial\nvelocity (RV). Results: We have unambiguously detected a weak Stokes V signal\nin the spectral lines of Pollux, and measured the related surface-averaged\nlongitudinal magnetic field Bl. The longitudinal field averaged over the span\nof the observations is below one gauss. Our data suggest variations of the\nlongitudinal magnetic field, but no significant variation of the S-index. We\nobserve variations of RV which are qualitatively consistent with the published\nephemeris for a proposed exoplanet orbiting Pollux. The observed variations of\nBl appear to mimic those of RV, but additional data for this relationship to be\nestablished. Using evolutionary models including the effects of rotation, we\nderive the mass of Pollux and we discuss its evolutionary status and the origin\nof its magnetic field. Conclusions: This work presents the first direct\ndetection of the magnetic field of Pollux, and demonstrates that ESPaDOnS and\nNARVAL are capable of obtaining sub-G measurements of the surface-averaged\nlongitudinal magnetic field of giant stars, and of directly studying the\nrelationships between magnetic activity, stellar evolution and planet hosting\nof these stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2009 07:48:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The\nbranching fractions for these decays with higher $K$-resonances in the final\nstate are suppressed due to the smaller phase spaces and the smaller values of\n$\\zeta^{K_J^{(*)}}_{\\perp,\\parallel}$.

Exact expressions of the\ncomplex admittance are derived in various types of formulations of equations of\nmotion under contact with heat reservoir. Namely, the complex admittance is\nstudied in the relaxation method and the external-field method. In the former\nmethod, the admittance is calculated using the Kubo formula for quantum systems\nin contact with heat reservoir in no external driving fields, while in the\nlatter method the admittance is directly calculated from equations of motion\nwith external driving terms. In each method, two types of equation of motions\nare considered, i.e., the time-convolution (TC) equation and\ntime-convolutionless (TCL) equation. That is, the full of the four cases are\nstudied.
