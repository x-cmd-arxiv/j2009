No clear\ncorrelations were found between the Li abundance and those of other elements.\nWith the exception of the two most Li rich stars, the others follow a fairly\ntight A(Li)-T_eff correlation. It would seems that there must be a Li\nproduction phase during the red giant branch (RGB), acting either on a very\nshort timescale, or selectively only in some stars.

The importance sampling is based,\neither on a guiding function or on an initial variational wave function. Here\nwe investigate the need of importance sampling in the case of Path Integral\nGround State (PIGS) Monte Carlo. PIGS is based on a discrete imaginary time\nevolution of an initial wave function with a non zero overlap with the ground\nstate, that gives rise to a discrete path which is sampled via a Metropolis\nlike algorithm. In principle the exact ground state is reached in the limit of\nan infinite imaginary time evolution, but actual computations are based on\nfinite time evolutions and the question is whether such computations give\nunbiased exact results. We have studied bulk liquid and solid 4He with PIGS by\nconsidering as initial wave function a constant, i.e. the ground state of an\nideal Bose gas. This implies that the evolution toward the ground state is\ndriven only by the imaginary time propagator, i.e. there is no importance\nsampling. For both the phases we obtain results converging to those obtained by\nconsidering the best available variational wave function (the Shadow wave\nfunction) as initial wave function. Moreover we obtain the same results even by\nconsidering wave functions with the wrong correlations, for instance a wave\nfunction of a strongly localized Einstein crystal for the liquid phase. This\nconvergence is true not only for diagonal properties such as the energy, the\nradial distribution function and the static structure factor, but also for\noff-diagonal ones, such as the one--body density matrix. From this analysis we\nconclude that zero temperature PIGS calculations can be as unbiased as those of\nfinite temperature Path Integral Monte Carlo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2009 14:41:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2009 08:02:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-20"}

The CSP differs from other projects to date in its\ngoal of providing an I-band {rest-frame} Hubble diagram. Here we present the\nfirst results from near-infrared (NIR) observations obtained using the Magellan\nBaade telescope for SNe Ia with 0.1 < z < 0.7. We combine these results with\nthose from the low-redshift CSP at z <0.1 (Folatelli et al. 2009). We present\nlight curves and an I-band Hubble diagram for this first sample of 35 SNe Ia\nand we compare these data to 21 new SNe Ia at low redshift. These data support\nthe conclusion that the expansion of the Universe is accelerating. When\ncombined with independent results from baryon acoustic oscillations (Eisenstein\net al. 2005), these data yield Omega_m = 0.27 +/- 0.0 (statistical), and\nOmega_DE = 0.76 +/- 0.13 (statistical) +/- 0.09 (systematic), for the matter\nand dark energy densities, respectively. If we parameterize the data in terms\nof an equation of state, w, assume a flat geometry, and combine with baryon\nacoustic oscillations, we find that w = -1.05 +/- 0.13 (statistical) +/- 0.09\n(systematic). The largest source of systematic uncertainty on w arises from\nuncertainties in the photometric calibration, signaling the importance of\nsecuring more accurate photometric calibrations for future supernova cosmology\nprograms. Finally, we conclude that either the dust affecting the luminosities\nof SNe Ia has a different extinction law (R_V = 1.8) than that in the Milky Way\n(where R_V = 3.1), or that there is an additional intrinsic color term with\nluminosity for SNe Ia independent of the decline rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Jul 2009 22:12:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-25"}

The\nproblem of finding the quotient complexity of a language f(K,L) is considered,\nwhere K and L are regular languages and f is a regular operation, for example,\nunion or concatenation.

Combining the small line widths with the non-detection up to\n70mum and the absence of other signs of star formation activity, most of these\n17 cores with masses between sub-solar to ~10M_sun are likely still in a\nstarless phase. Furthermore, we find a large CS depletion factor of the order\n100. Although the strongest line and continuum peak is close to virial\nequilibrium, its slightly broader line width compared to the other cores is\nconsistent with it being in a contraction phase potentially at the verge of\nstar formation. The relative peak velocities between neighboring cores are\nusually below 1km/s, and we do not identify streaming motions along the\nfilamentary structures. Average densities are between 10^5 and 10^6cm^{-3} (one\nto two orders of magnitude larger than for example in the Pipe nebula) implying\nrelatively small Jeans-lengths that are consistent with the observed core\nseparations of the order 5000AU. The quest for high-mass starless cores prior\nto any star formation activity remains open.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2009 08:42:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

In attempt to explain the phenomena we use power\nspectral methods to perform a parameter study of the Brownian motion of\noptically trapped liquid aerosol droplets concentrated around the critically\ndamped regime. We present evidence that the system is suitably described by a\nsimple harmonic oscillator model which must include a description of\nFax\\'{e}n's correction, but not necessarily frequency dependent hydrodynamic\ncorrections to Stokes' law. We also provide results describing how the system\nbehaves under several variables and discuss the difficulty in decoupling the\nparameters responsible for the observed behaviour. We show that due to the\nrelatively low dynamic viscosity and high trap stiffness it is easy to transfer\nbetween over- and under-damped motion by experimentally altering either trap\nstiffness or damping. Our results suggest stable aerosol trapping may be\nachieved in under-damped conditions, but the onset of deleterious optical\nforces at high trapping powers prevents the probing of the upper stability\nlimits due to Brownian motion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2009 09:46:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Jun 2010 08:17:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

We emphasize that the 'nucleus' must possess Nc^2 degrees of\nfreedom per unit volume, so like a finite-temperature plasma, in order for a\nsupergravity description to exist. We critically reassess previous proposals\nfor introducing transverse inhomogeneity in the shockwave and formulate a new\nproposal in that sense, which involves no external source but requires the\nintroduction of an 'infrared' cutoff which mimics confinement. This cutoff\nhowever plays no role when the shockwave is probed by a highly virtual\nprojectile, so like in deep inelastic scattering. We consider two such\nprojectiles, the dilaton and the R-current, and compute the respective\nstructure functions including unitarity corrections. We find that there are no\nleading-twist contributions to the structure functions at high virtuality,\nmeaning that there are no point-like constituents in the strongly coupled\n'nucleus'. In the black-disk regime at low virtuality, the structure functions\nare suggestive of parton saturation with occupation numbers of order one.

If such nu_h exists its admixtures in the decay Ds -> mu+nu would\nresult in the decay Ds -> mu+nu_h with the branching fraction \\simeq\n(1.2-5.5)\\times 10^{-4}, which is in the experimentally accessible range.\nInterestingly, the existence of the Ds -> mu+nu_h decay at this level may also\nexplain why the currently measured decay rate of Ds -> mu+nu is slightly higher\nthan the predicted one. This enhances motivation for a sensitive search for\nthis decay mode and makes it interesting and complementary to neutrino\nexperiments probing sterile-active neutrino mixing. Considering, as an example\nthe CLEO-c experiment, we suggest to perform a search for the decay Ds ->\nmu+nu_h with the analysis of existing data. The discrepancy between the\nmeasurements and theoretical description of the decay Ds -> tau+nu is also\ndiscussed in brief.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2009 15:43:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-12"}

In some cases, this area law is corrected\nwith a logarithmic factor. This contrasts with the fact that in almost all\nstates of the Hilbert space, the entropy of a region is proportional to its\nvolume. This paper shows that low-energy states have (at most) an area law with\nthe logarithmic correction, provided two conditions hold: (i) the state has\nsufficient decay of correlations, (ii) the number of eigenstates with vanishing\nenergy-density is not exponential in the volume. These two conditions are\nsatisfied by many relevant systems. The central idea of the argument is that\nenergy fluctuations inside a region can be observed by measuring the exterior\nand a superficial shell of the region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2009 15:57:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2009 08:01:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2009 08:50:56 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2009 08:19:40 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2010 09:02:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-09"}
