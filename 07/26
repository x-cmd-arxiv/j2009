Consistent treatment of the\nelectrochemical system as comprising two interacting subsystems - the chemical\nand the electrical (electrochemical) - leads to ln-logistic map of states of\nthe electrochemical system with non-unity coefficient of the electrical charge\ntransfer. This factor provides for a feedback and causes dynamic behavior of\nelectrochemical systems, including bifurcations and electrochemical\noscillations. The latter occur beyond bifurcation point at essential deviation\nof the chemical subsystem from true thermodynamic equilibrium. If the charge\ntransfer coefficient takes on unity, the map turns into classical equation of\nelectrochemical equilibrium. Spectra of electrochemical oscillations, resulted\nfrom the DTD formalism, are multifractals.

A complete drop in the resistivity to 0, along with a\nfinite fraction of Meissner flux expulsion, has been observed in M=Sr, Tc = 22\nK. Using In-flux grown single crystal samples of undoped BaFe2As2, we find a\ncomplete drop in the resistivity to 0 in most samples beginning at Tc(onset) =\n22.5 K. However, in contrast to the SrFe2As2 results, there is no measurable\nMeissner effect and no suppression of the resistive superconducting transition\nwith annealing. The current sensitivity of the superconducting resistive\ntransition in our samples of BaFe2As2 is quite strong, with an increase in the\ncurrent density of a factor of 15 to ~ 1.5 A/cm2 not changing Tc(onset) but\nbroadening the transition significantly and causing the resistivity to remain\nfinite as T approaches 0.

Transport of angular momentum is due to\n\"turbulent\" viscosity induced by supernova explosions in the star formation\nregion. Analytical solutions of the equations are found for the initial cases\nof a gaseous ring and the integrated form for a gaseous disk, respectively. For\na ring with enough low viscosity, it evolves in a slow processes of gaseous\ndiffusion and star formation near the initial radius. For a high viscosity, the\nring rapidly diffuses in the early phase. The diffusion drives the ring into a\nregion with a low viscosity and start the second phase undergoing pile-up of\ngas at a radius following the decreased viscosity torque. The third is a\nsharply deceasing phase because of star formation consumption of gas and\nefficient transportation of gas inward forming a stellar disk.

The constant depends on the properties of the local\nspecifications of $q^n$. The above inequality implies a logarithmic Sobolev\ninequality for $q^n$. We get an explicit lower bound for the logarithmic\nSobolev constant of $q^n$ under the assumptions that: (i) the local\nspecifications of $q^n$ satisfy logarithmic Sobolev inequalities with constants\n$\\rho_i$, and (ii) they also satisfy some condition expressing that the mixed\npartial derivatives of the Hamiltonian of $q^n$ are not too large relative to\nthe logarithmic Sobolev constants $\\rho_i$. Condition (ii) may be weaker than\nthat used in Otto and Reznikoff's recent paper on the estimation of logarithmic\nSobolev constants of spin systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Jul 2009 15:48:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2015 15:04:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

It provides a runtime environment and a set of APIs that allow developers\nto build .NET applications that leverage their computation on either public or\nprivate clouds. One of the key features of Aneka is the ability of supporting\nmultiple programming models that are ways of expressing the execution logic of\napplications by using specific abstractions. This is accomplished by creating a\ncustomizable and extensible service oriented runtime environment represented by\na collection of software containers connected together. By leveraging on these\narchitecture advanced services including resource reservation, persistence,\nstorage management, security, and performance monitoring have been implemented.\nOn top of this infrastructure different programming models can be plugged to\nprovide support for different scenarios as demonstrated by the engineering,\nlife science, and industry applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Jul 2009 02:19:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-28"}
