The origin of the absorbing\nmaterial is controversial, but it may suggest the presence of circumstellar gas\nin the progenitor system prior to the explosion, with significant implications\nfor the nature of the supernova progenitors. We present the third detection of\nsuch variable absorption, based on six epochs of high-resolution spectroscopy\nof the Type Ia supernova SN 2007le from Keck and the HET. The data span ~3\nmonths, from 5 days before maximum light to 90 days after maximum. We find that\none component of the Na D absorption lines strengthened significantly with\ntime, indicating a total column density increase of ~2.5 x 10^12 cm^-2. The\nchanges are most prominent after maximum light rather than at earlier times\nwhen the UV flux from the SN peaks. As with SN 2006X, we detect no change in\nthe Ca II H&K lines over the same time period, rendering line-of-sight effects\nimprobable and suggesting a circumstellar origin for the absorbing material.\nUnlike the previous two SNe exhibiting variable absorption, SN 2007le is not\nhighly reddened (E_B-V = 0.27 mag), also pointing toward circumstellar rather\nthan interstellar absorption. Photoionization models show that the data are\nconsistent with a dense (10^7 cm^-3) cloud or clouds of gas located ~0.1 pc\nfrom the explosion. These results broadly support the single-degenerate\nscenario previously proposed to explain the variable absorption, with mass loss\nfrom a nondegenerate companion star responsible for providing the circumstellar\ngas. We also present tentative evidence for narrow Halpha emission associated\nwith the SN, which will require followup observations at late times to confirm.\n[abridged]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2009 19:24:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-28"}

Due to the nonlinearity of the\nKohn-Sham equations, the general self-consistence searching method involves\niterations with alternate solving of the Poisson and Schr\\\"{o}dinger equations.\nOne of problems of such an approach is that the charge distribution renewed by\nmeans of the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation solution does not conform to boundary\nconditions of Poisson equation for Coulomb potential. The resulting instability\nor even divergence of iterations manifests itself most appreciably in the case\nof infinitely extended systems. The published attempts to deal with this\nproblem are reduced in fact to abandoning the original iterative method and\nreplacing it with some approximate calculation scheme, which is usually\nsemi-empirical and does not permit to evaluate the extent of deviation from the\nexact solution. In this work, we realize the iterative scheme of solving the\nKohn-Sham equations for extended systems with inhomogeneous electron gas, which\nis based on eliminating the long-range character of Coulomb interaction as the\ncause of tight coupling between charge distribution and boundary conditions.\nThe suggested algorithm is employed to calculate energy spectrum,\nself-consistent potential, and electrostatic capacitance of the semi-infinite\ndegenerate electron gas bounded by infinitely high barrier, as well as the work\nfunction and surface energy of simple metals in the jellium model. The\ndifference between self-consistent Hartree solutions and those taking into\naccount the exchange-correlation interaction is analyzed.

In contrast, the particular\nsawtooth structure of the extended emission at the rim of each ionized bubble\nharbours either small lower-mass clusters with a younger stellar population or\nindividual young reddened protostars. In particular, triggered star formation\nis considered to be at work in these regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2009 16:30:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

However, even this relatively simple requirement is beyond the\ncapacity of today's average RFID tag. A recently proposed solution, Fingerprint\nExtraction and Random Number Generation in SRAM (FERNS) [14, 15], involves the\nuse of onboard RAM as the source of \"true\" randomness. Unfortunately, practical\nconsiderations prevent this approach from reaching its full potential. First,\nthis method must compete with other system functionalities for use of memory.\nThus, the amount of uninitialized RAM available for utilization as a randomness\ngenerator may be severely restricted. Second, RAM is subject to data remanence;\nthere is a time period after losing power during which stored data remains\nintact in memory. This means that after a portion of memory has been used for\nentropy collection once it will require a relatively extended period of time\nwithout power before it can be reused. In a usable RFID based security\napplication, which requires multiple or long random numbers, this may lead to\nunacceptably high delays.\n  In this paper, we show that data remanence negatively affects RAM based\nrandom number generation. We demonstrate the practical considerations that must\nbe taken into account when using RAM as an entropy source. We also discuss the\nimplementation of a true random number generator on Intel's WISP RFID tag,\nwhich is the first such implementation to the authors' best knowledge. By\nrelating this to the requirements of some popular RFID authentication\nprotocols, we assess the (im)practicality of utilizing memory based randomness\ntechniques on resource constrained devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2009 16:51:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-08"}

It is\nwell-known that in the scaling limit the model exhibits phase-separation, with\nregions of order and disorder sharply separated by a smooth curve, called the\narctic curve. To find this curve, we study a multiple integral representation\nfor the emptiness formation probability, a correlation function devised to\ndetect spatial transition from order to disorder. We conjecture that the arctic\ncurve, for arbitrary choice of the vertex weights, can be characterized by the\ncondition of condensation of almost all roots of the corresponding saddle-point\nequations at the same, known, value.

Given observational constraints at the current time for a\ngiven planet (semi-major axis, eccentricity, and system age) we find possible\nevolutionary paths that match these constraints, and compare the calculated\nradii to observations. We find that tidal evolution has two effects. First,\nplanets start their evolution at larger semi-major axis, allowing them to\ncontract more efficiently at earlier times. Second, tidal heating can\nsignificantly inflate the radius when the orbit is being circularized, but this\neffect on the radius is short-lived thereafter. Often circularization of the\norbit is proceeded by a long period while the semi-major axis slowly decreases.\nSome systems with previously unexplained large radii that we can reproduce with\nour coupled model are HAT-P-7, HAT-P-9, WASP-10, and XO-4.

Although individual sources\nbehave somewhat differently, common X-ray characteristics of this class are\nemerging such as outburst lengths well in excess of hours, with a multiple\npeaked structure. A high dynamic range (including bright outbursts) of 4 orders\nof magnitude has been observed. We performed out-of-outburst intensity-based\nspectroscopy. Spectral fits with an absorbed blackbody always result in\nblackbody radii of a few hundred meters, consistent with being emitted from a\nsmall portion of the neutron star surface, very likely the neutron star polar\ncaps.

The multiple temperature model is a\nnatural generalization of Winfree's abstract tile assembly model, where the\ntemperature of a tile system is allowed to be shifted up and down as\nself-assembly proceeds. We first exhibit two constant-size tile sets in which\nscaled-up versions of arbitrary shapes self-assemble. Our first tile set has\nthe property that each scaled shape self-assembles via an asymptotically\n\"Kolmogorov-optimum\" temperature sequence but the scaling factor grows with the\nsize of the shape being assembled. In contrast, our second tile set assembles\neach scaled shape via a temperature sequence whose length is proportional to\nthe number of points in the shape but the scaling factor is a constant\nindependent of the shape being assembled. We then show that there is no\nconstant-size tile set that can uniquely assemble an arbitrary (non-scaled,\nconnected) shape in the multiple temperature model, i.e., the scaling is\nnecessary for self-assembly. This answers an open question of Kao and Schweller\n(Reducing Tile Complexity for Self-Assembly Through Temperature Programming,\nSODA 2006), who asked whether such a tile set existed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2009 21:37:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-30"}

However, a more realistic scenario is\nobtained from the interpolation between these two cases, considering a certain\nnumber of stochastic contacts per unit time.

We resolve a\nfamily of models, parameterized by the number of stochastic contact trials per\nunit time, that range from the CP to the RP.

We show how significant information\nabout the charge distribution around vacancies in cerium oxide can be gained\nfrom a study of high resolution crystal structures of higher order oxides which\nexhibit ordering of oxygen vacancies. Specifically, we consider the\nimplications of a bond valence sum analysis of Ce$_{7}$O$_{12}$ and\nCe$_{11}$O$_{20}$. To illuminate our analysis we show alternative\nrepresentations of the crystal structures in terms of orderly arrays of\nco-ordination defects and in terms of flourite-type modules. We found that in\nCe$_{7}$O$_{12}$, the excess charge resulting from removal of an oxygen atom\ndelocalizes among all three triclinic Ce sites closest to the O vacancy. In\nCe$_{11}$O$_{20}$, the charge localizes on the next nearest neighbour Ce atoms.\nOur main result is that the charge prefers to distribute itself so that it is\nfarthest away from the O vacancies. This contradicts \\emph{the standard picture\nof charge localisation} which assumes that each of the two excess electrons\nlocalises on one of the cerium ions nearest to the vacancy. This standard\npicture is assumed in most calculations based on density functional theory\n(DFT). Based on the known crystal structure of Pr$_{6}$O$_{11}$, we also\npredict that the charge in Ce$_{6}$O$_{11}$ will be found in the second\ncoordination shell of the O vacancy.

The\nCCD pixel coordinates of the reference stars will be used to refine the\nastronomical position of the satellite, which will facilitate trigger rapid\nground-based follow-up obsevations of the GRBs. In this algorithm, the image is\ndivided into a number of grid cells and the \"global\" pixel-value maximum within\neach cell is taken as the first-guess position of a \"bright\" star.

To examine the efficiency of the above\naglorithms, we applied them to the experimental images obtained with a\nground-based telescope.

Their\nmaintenance is a challenging and costly task, for obvious security reasons. The\ngoal is to ensure a proper operation of the engines, in all conditions, with a\nzero probability of failure, while taking into account aging. The fact that the\nsame engine is sometimes used on several aircrafts has to be taken into account\ntoo. The maintenance can be improved if an efficient procedure for the\nprediction of failures is implemented. The primary source of information on the\nhealth of the engines comes from measurement during flights. Several variables\nsuch as the core speed, the oil pressure and quantity, the fan speed, etc. are\nmeasured, together with environmental variables such as the outside\ntemperature, altitude, aircraft speed, etc. In this paper, we describe the\ndesign of a procedure aiming at visualizing successive data measured on\naircraft engines. The data are multi-dimensional measurements on the engines,\nwhich are projected on a self-organizing map in order to allow us to follow the\ntrajectories of these data over time. The trajectories consist in a succession\nof points on the map, each of them corresponding to the two-dimensional\nprojection of the multi-dimensional vector of engine measurements.

A comparison with the clusters Coma and\nA1367 and a sample of field galaxies has shown the presence of cluster galaxies\nwith L(Halpha) lower than expected for their MB, a consecuence of the cluster\nenvironment. This fact results in differences in the\n  L(Halpha) vs. EW(Halpha) and L(H\\alpha) distributions of the clusters with\nrespect to the field, and in cluster to cluster variations of these quantities,\nwhich we propose are driven by a global cluster property as the total mass.\nOverall, we conclude that both, the global cluster environment as well as the\ncluster merging history play a non negligible role in the integral star\nformation properties of clusters of galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2009 09:38:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The secular\nperturbations cause orbits at different semi-major axes to precess at different\nrates, and after some time t_cross initially non-intersecting orbits begin to\ncross.

Next, from this intuitive definition we derived the physical\ndefinition of quantum consciousness (Quantum Consciousness Parameter or QCP).\nThis QCP is the elementary level of consciousness in quantum particles, which\nare the most elementary particles in nature. Thus QCP can explain both the\nperceptible and non-perceptible nature and some existing postulates of physics.\nWe conceptualize that the level of human consciousness is most complex having\nhighest fractal dimension of 4.85 in the electroencephalographs experiment done\nby other research groups. On the other hand, other species are having lesser\nconsciousness level, which can be reflected by lesser fractal dimensions. We\nhave also explored the bio informatics of consciousness from genome viewpoints\nwhere we tried to draw an analogy of neurons with electrons and photons.\nLastly, we refine the quantum mechanics in terms of QCP; we all know that in\nEinstein's special theory of relativity, Einstein has used the postulate\n\"Consistency of the velocity of light irrespective of all frames of reference\n(inertial or non-inertial frames)\". In our theoretical revelation QCP can be\ndirectly applied to get a confirmatory proof of this postulate. Thus the\npostulate can be framed as a law.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2009 11:28:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-10"}

Rev. \\textbf{E\n78},025301,(2008)] to modelling Perm dynamo torus in liquid sodium. Since\ndiffusion and advection (stretching), are competing effects for dynamo action,\nplasma resistivity term is shown to be proportional to loops Riemann curvature\n(folding). Shukurov et al, also showed that based on Ponomarenko dynamo, a\nbroader torus channel produces a better dynamo. These results agree with\nSchekochihin et al [Phys Rev \\textbf{E} (2002)] where random filamentary\nmagnetic fields are strengthen by curvature. Analysis of spectrum of chaotic\nfast dynamos, shows that Riemann curvature acts as a damping, since growth\nmagnetic field rate is inversely proportional to Riemann curvature. Comparison\nwith general relativistic MHD dynamo equation, shows that the Ricci tensor,\nwhich is a contraction of the Riemann tensor also appears in the diffusion\nterm. Curvature of plasma loop is\n${{R^{1}}_{212}}|_{\\textbf{Plasma}}\\approx{5.6{\\times}10^{-19}m^{-2}}$, while\nfor Perm torus is certainly higher. Thus slow dynamos are favoured in dynamo\nlaboratories rather than in plasma loops. It is shown that the\ncurvature-stretching flux rope dynamo coupling energy, coincides with the\nminimum twist energy ${\\epsilon}_{\\textbf{twist}}\\approx{10^{30}TeV}$ stored in\nflux ropes. Torus flux tubes around black-holes remain in the order of $2MeV$\nand GBR are around $10^{52}TeV$. Since the ${R^{1}}_{212}$ is negative,\ninflexionary flux tubes fast dynamos may be responsible for this CME mechanism\nin UHF plasma loops.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2009 11:42:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2009 05:45:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-10"}
