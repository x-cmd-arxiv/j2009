In this note, we study the\npotential astrophysical signatures of a new class of hidden sector decaying DM\nmodels, which can address the recent cosmic ray measurements. Such models may\nproduce primary photons and/or neutrinos at large rates, correlated with the\nleptonic production. The photon and neutrino spectra will then contain sharp\nfeatures at the TeV scale. We demonstrate the discovery potential for upcoming\nand future measurements by FERMI, HESS, AGIS and IceCube/DeepCore. We show that\nthese models may be discovered in the near future. Specifically, measurements\nof diffuse gamma rays by FERMI can detect the start of a hard photon feature.\nWe argue that these hard spectra can be produced by decaying dark matter and be\nconsistent with current constraints, but are difficult to reconcile with models\nof annihilating DM. Consequently the measurement of a hard spectral feature, in\ncorrelation with the current cosmic ray measurements, will strongly favor\ndecaying DM models. Finally we comment on the preliminary results from the\nInner Galaxy presented by the FERMI collaboration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2009 19:44:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Aug 2009 20:09:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-11"}

Since the horseshoe drag has a steep\ndependence on the width of the horseshoe region, we provide an adequate\ndefinition of the width that needs to be used in horseshoe drag estimates. We\nthen consider the case of locally isothermal disks, in which the tempera- ture\nis constant in time but depends on the distance to the star. The horseshoe drag\nappears to be different from the case of a globally isothermal disk. The\ndifference, which is due to the driving of vortensity in the vicinity of the\nplanet, is intimately linked to the topology of the flow. We provide a\ndescriptive inter- pretation of these effects, as well as a crude estimate of\nthe dependency of the excess on the temperature gradient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2009 16:09:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

A good morphological correlation is observed\nbetween the PDRs and the molecular gas mapped in the 13CO J=1--0 and CS J=2--1\nlines, suggesting that G45L may be collecting the molecular material. From a\nnear- and mid-IR photometric study, we found three sources, likely O-type\nstars, that are possibly responsible for the creation of G45L.

An empirical selection criterion is derived from colors of HII\nregions in M81 and M101 that differentiates between the young, blue stellar\ncomponent and the older disk and bulge population. This criterion is applied to\na sample of 58 galaxies of Hubble type S0 and later and verified through an\napplication of Fisher's linear discriminant analysis. It is found that 60%\n(49%) of ULXs in optically-bright environments are within regions blueward of\ntheir host galaxy's HII regions compared to only 27% (0%) of a control sample\naccording to the empirical (Fisher) criterion. This is an excess of 3-sigma\nabove the 32% (27%) expected if the ULXs were randomly distributed within their\ngalactic hosts. This indicates a ULX preference for young, approximately <10\nMyr, OB associations. However, none of the ULX environments have the morphology\nand optical brightness suggestive of a massive young super star cluster though\nseveral are in extended or crowded star-forming (blue) environments that may\ncontain clusters unresolved by Sloan imaging. Ten of the 12 ULX candidates with\nestimated X-ray luminosities in excess of 3e39 erg/s are equally divided among\nthe group of ULX environments redward of HII regions and the group of optically\nfaint regions. This likely indicates that the brightest ULXs turn on at a time\nsomewhat later than typical of HII regions; say 10-20 Myr after star formation\nhas ended. This would be consistent with the onset of an accretion phase as the\ndonor star ascends the giant branch if the donor is a <20 solar-mass star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2009 17:51:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

LVL covers an unbiased, representative, and\nstatistically robust sample of nearby star-forming galaxies, exploiting the\nhighest extragalactic spatial resolution achievable with Spitzer. As a result\nof its approximately volume-limited nature, LVL augments previous Spitzer\nobservations of present-day galaxies with improved sampling of the\nlow-luminosity galaxy population. The collection of LVL galaxies shows a large\nspread in mid-infrared colors, likely due to the conspicuous deficiency of 8um\nPAH emission from low-metallicity, low-luminosity galaxies. Conversely, the\nfar-infrared emission tightly tracks the total infrared emission, with a\ndispersion in their flux ratio of only 0.1 dex. In terms of the relation\nbetween infrared-to-ultraviolet ratio and ultraviolet spectral slope, the LVL\nsample shows redder colors and/or lower infrared-to-ultraviolet ratios than\nstarburst galaxies, suggesting that reprocessing by dust is less important in\nthe lower mass systems that dominate the LVL sample.

In this\npaper we extend the asymptotic fluctuation theorem for the first time to\ninhomogeneous continuous-time processes without a stationary distribution,\nconsidering specifically a finite state Markov chain driven by periodic\ntransition rates.

To prevent any malicious\ncontrol of or eavesdropping over the communication, the channel is desired to\nbe authenticated and confidential. The process of setting up a secure\ncommunication channel between two previously unassociated devices is referred\nto as \"Secure Device Pairing\". When there is no prior security context, e.g.,\nshared secrets, common key servers or public key certificates, device pairing\nrequires user involvement into the process. The idea usually involves\nleveraging an auxiliary human-perceptible channel to authenticate the data\nexchanged over the insecure wireless channel.\n  We observe that the focus of prior research has mostly been limited to\npairing scenarios where a single user controls both the devices. In this paper,\nwe consider more general and emerging \"two-user\" scenarios, where two different\nusers establish pairing between their respective devices. Although a number of\npairing methods exists in the literature, only a handful of those are\napplicable to the two-user setting. We present the first study to identify the\nmethods practical for two-user pairing scenarios, and comparatively evaluate\nthe usability of these methods.

Since\nsynchrotron losses vary strongly with electron energy, the source size drops\nwith increasing X-ray energy, resulting in a steepening of the synchrotron\nspectrum. For homogeneous sources, this burnoff produces the well-known result\nof a steepening by 0.5 in the source's integrated spectral index. However, for\ninhomogeneous sources, different amounts of steepening are possible.

The relevant phases are prompt and steady-state convection, the\nstanding accretion shock instability (SASI), and asymmetric explosions. For the\nstages before explosion, we propose a model for the source of GW emission.\nDowndrafts of the postshock-convection/SASI region strike the protoneutron star\n\"surface\" with large speeds and are decelerated by buoyancy forces. We find\nthat the GW amplitude is set by the magnitude of deceleration and, by\nextension, the downdraft's speed and the vigor of postshock-convective/SASI\nmotions. However, the characteristic frequencies, which evolve from ~100 Hz\nafter bounce to ~300-400 Hz, are primarily independent of these speeds, but are\nset by the deceleration timescale, which is in turn set by the buoyancy\nfrequency at the lower boundary of postshock convection. Consequently, the GW\ncharacteristic frequencies are dependent upon a combination of core structure\nattributes, specifically the dense-matter equation of state (EOS) and details\nthat determine the gradients at the boundary, including the accretion-rate\nhistory, the EOS at subnuclear densities, and neutrino transport.

Two main species of Ge hut\nclusters composing the arrays - pyramidal and wedge-shaped ones - have been\nfound to have different atomic structures. The inference is made that shape\ntransitions between pyramids and wedges are impossible. The nucleation\nprobabilities of pyramids and wedges equal 1/2 at the initial stage of the\narray formation. The wedges become the dominating species as the amount of the\ndeposited germanium is increased. A fraction and a density of the pyramids in\nthe arrays are rapidly decreased with the growth of Ge coverage.\n  The derivative types of the clusters - obelisks (or truncated wedges) and\naccreted wedges - have been revealed and investigated for the first time, they\nhave been found to start dominating at high Ge coverages. The obelisks\noriginate from the wedges as a result of their height limitation and further\ngrowth of trapezoid facets. The apexes of the obelisks are formed by sets of\nthe parallel (001) ridges.\n  The uniformity of the cluster arrays have been evidenced to be controlled by\nthe length of the wedge-like clusters.

Fitting the observed disk rotational velocities and radii with a\nMo, Mao, White (1998) (MMW) model requires unusually large disk spin parameters\nlambda_d>0.1 and disk-to-dark halo mass fraction m_d=0.2, close to the cosmic\nbaryon fraction. The galaxies segregate into dispersion-dominated systems with\n1<vmax/sigma<3, maximum rotational velocities vmax<200 km/s and disk half-light\nradii rd=1-3 kpc and rotation-dominated systems with vmax>200 km/s,\nvmax/sigma>3 and rd=4-8 kpc. For the dispersion-dominated sample, radial\npressure gradients partly compensate the gravitational force, reducing the\nrotational velocities. Including this pressure effect in the MMW model,\ndispersion-dominated galaxies can be fitted well with spin parameters lf\nlambda_d=0.03-0.05 for high disk mass fractions of m_d=0.2 and with\nlambda_d=0.01-0.03 for m_d=0.05.

It is shown that the observed high turbulent gas motions of the\ngalaxies are consistent with a Toomre instability parameter Q=1 which is equal\nto the critical value, expected for gravitational disk instability to be the\nmajor driver of turbulence.

The proof exploits\nGauss' lemma and the fact that the bilinear oscillatory integrals in\nH\\\"ormander's proof of the Carleson-Sj\\\"olin theorem become better and better\nbehaved away from the diagonal. Our results are related to a recent work of\nBourgain who showed that $L^2$ averages over geodesics of eigenfunctions are\nsmall compared to a natural power of the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ provided that the\n$L^4(M)$ norms are similarly small. Our results imply that QUE cannot hold on a\ncompact boundaryless Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ of dimension two if\n$L^p$-norms are saturated for a given $2<p<6$. We also show that eigenfunctions\ncannot have a maximal rate of $L^2$-mass concentrating along unit portions of\ngeodesics that are not smoothly closed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2009 03:20:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2009 20:15:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2009 18:32:01 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 5 May 2010 15:07:22 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 26 May 2010 14:59:57 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 14 Jun 2010 16:11:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-15"}

The high-quality\nand time-extended photometric data give us an opportunity to address various\nphenomena associated with young stars.

Both\nthe sequence of 2:1 eccentricity resonances that the system is driven through\nby continued migration and the possibility of a subsequent capture into the 4:2\ninclination resonances are sensitive to the migration rate within the range\nexpected for type II migration. If the migration rate is fast, the resonant\npair can evolve into a family of 2:1 eccentricity resonances different from\nthose found by Lee (2004). This new family has outer orbital eccentricity e_2 >\n0.4-0.5, asymmetric librations of both eccentricity resonance variables, and\norbits that intersect if they are exactly coplanar. Although this family exists\nfor an inner-to-outer planet mass ratio m_1/m_2 > 0.2, it is possible to evolve\ninto this family by fast migration only for m_1/m_2 > 2. Thommes and Lissauer\n(2003) have found that a capture into the 4:2 inclination resonances is\npossible only for m_1/m_2 < 2. We show that this capture is also possible for\nm_1/m_2 > 2 if the migration rate is slightly slower than that adopted by\nThommes and Lissauer. There is significant theoretical uncertainty in both the\nsign and the magnitude of the net effect of planet-disk interaction on the\norbital eccentricity of a planet. If the eccentricity is damped on a timescale\ncomparable to or shorter than the migration timescale, e_2 may not be able to\nreach the values needed to enter either the new 2:1 eccentricity resonances or\nthe 4:2 inclination resonances. Thus, if future observations of extrasolar\nplanetary systems were to reveal certain combinations of mass ratio and\nresonant configuration, they would place a constraint on the strength of\neccentricity damping during migration, as well as on the migration rate itself.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2009 05:46:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The data are fully calibrated\nand obtained with the state-of-the-art pulsar hardware available at Parkes. The\nfinal data sets are archived and are currently being used to carry out studies\nof 1) pulsar glitches, 2) timing noise, 3) pulse profile stability over long\ntime scales and 4) the extreme nulling phenomenon. The data are also included\nin other projects such as gamma-ray observatory support and for the Parkes\nPulsar Timing Array project.

We identify three zones\ndistinguished by polarized emission properties: the disc, the halo, and a\ntransition region connecting them. The halo section lies at latitudes |b| >\n40-deg and has weak and smooth polarized emission mostly at large scale with\nsteep angular power spectra of median slope $\\beta_{\\rm med} \\sim -2.6$.

The nodes know their locations, and\nthey sleep-wake cycle, waking up periodically but not synchronously. In this\nsituation, when a node has a packet to forward to the sink, there is a\ntrade-off between how long this node waits for a suitable neighbor to wake up\nand the progress the packet makes towards the sink once it is forwarded to this\nneighbr. Hence, in choosing a relay node, we consider the problem of minimizing\naverage delay subject to a constraint on the average progress. By constraint\nrelaxation, involving a Lagrange multiplier, we formulate this next hop relay\nselection problem as a Markov decision process (MDP). The exact optimal\nsolution (BF (Best Forward)) can be found, but is computationally intensive.\nNext, we consider a mathematically simplified model for which the optimal\npolicy (SF (Simplified Forward)) turns out to be a simple one-step-look-ahead\nrule. Simulations show that SF is very close in performance to BF, even for\nreasonably small node density. We then study the end-to-end performance of SF\nin comparison with two extremal policies: Max Forward (MF), which makes the\nmaximum possible progress per hop and thus reduces network energy consumption,\nand First Forward (FF), which forwards the packet to the first node to wake up,\nand thus tends to make end-to-end forwarding delays small. We find that, with\nappropriate choice of one hop average progress constraint, SF can be tuned to\nprovide a favorable trade-off between end-to-end packet delay and the number of\nhops in the forwarding path.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2009 09:37:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2009 11:31:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2009 08:45:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-21"}

When the\nexit orifice is only a few grain diameter wide, the flow can be arrested due to\nthe formation of blocking arches. Hence, an external excitation is needed to\nresume the flow. The use of a continuous gentle vibration is a usual technique\nto ease the flow in such situations. Even though jamming is less frequent, it\nis still an issue in vibrated silos. There are, in principle, two possible\nmechanisms through which vibrations may facilitate the flow: (i) a decrease in\nthe probability of the formation of blocking arches, and (ii) the breakage of\nblocking arches once they have been formed. By measuring the time intervals\ninside an avalanche during which no particles flow through the outlet, we are\nable to estimate the probability of breaking a blocking arch by vibrations. The\nresult agrees with the prediction of a bivariate probabilistic model in which\nthe formation of blocking arches is equally probable in vibrated and\nnon-vibrated silos. This indicates that the second aforementioned mechanism is\nthe main responsible for improving the flowability in gently vibrated silos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2009 09:35:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-29"}

Finding ways for distinct CDNs to coordinate and cooperate\nwith other CDNs is necessary to achieve better overall service, as perceived by\nend-users, at lower cost. In this paper, we present an architecture to support\npeering arrangements between CDNs, based on a Virtual Organization (VO) model.\nOur approach promotes peering among providers, while upholding user perceived\nperformance.

The outer disk of this galaxy\ncontains ~23% of the total stellar mass budget of the galaxy and contributes\n~10% of the new stars created showing that this region of the galaxy is active.\nIn fact, the specific star formation rate of the outer disk (~0.012 Gyr^{-1})\nis a factor of ~2 larger (i.e. the star formation is more efficient per unit\nstellar mass) than in the inner disk. We have explored different scenarios to\nexplain the enhanced star formation in the outer disk.

Our approach benefits from several improvements\nwith respect to earlier relativistic SPH formulations. It is self-consistently\nderived from the Lagrangian of an ideal fluid and accounts for\nspecial-relativistic \"grad-h terms\". In our approach, we evolve the canonical\nmomentum and the canonical energy per baryon and thus circumvent some of the\nproblems that have plagued earlier formulations of relativistic SPH. We further\nuse a much improved artificial viscosity prescription which uses the extreme\nlocal eigenvalues of the Euler equations and triggers selectively on a) shocks\nand b) velocity noise. The shock trigger accurately monitors the relative\ndensity slope and uses it to fine-tune the amount of artificial viscosity that\nis applied. This procedure substantially sharpens shock fronts while still\navoiding post-shock noise. If not triggered, the viscosity parameter of each\nparticle decays to zero. None of these viscosity triggers is specific to\nspecial relativity, both could also be applied in Newtonian SPH. The\nperformance of the new scheme is explored in a large variety of benchmark tests\nwhere it delivers excellent results. Generally, the grad-h terms deliver minor,\nthough worthwhile, improvements. The scheme performs close to perfect in\nsupersonic advection tests, but also in strong relativistic shocks, usually\nconsidered a particular challenge for SPH, the method yields convincing\nresults. For example, due to its perfect conservation properties, it is able to\nhandle Lorentz-factors as large as $\\gamma= 50 \\; 000$ in the so-called wall\nshock test.

The statistical equilibrium of neutral and ionized silicon in the\natmospheres of metal-poor stars is discussed. Non-local thermodynamic\nequilibrium effects are investigated and the silicon abundances in metal-poor\nstars determined. Methods. We have used high resolution, high signal to noise\nratio spectra from the UVES spectragraph at the ESO VLT telescope. Line\nformation calculations of Si i and Si ii in the atmospheres of metal-poor stars\nare presented for atomic models of silicon including 174 terms and 1132 line\ntransitions. Recent improved calculations of Si i and Si ii photoionization\ncross-sections are taken into account, and the influence of the free-free\nquasi-molecular absorption in the Ly alpha wing is investigated by comparing\ntheoretical and observed fluxes of metal-poor stars. All abundance results are\nderived from LTE and NLTE statistical equilibrium calculations and spectrum\nsynthesis methods. Results. It is found that the extreme ultraviolet radiation\nis very important for metal-poor stars, especially for the high temperature,\nvery metal-poor stars. The radiative bound-free cross-sections also play a very\nimportant role for these stars. Conclusions. NLTE effects for Si are found to\nbe important for metal-poor stars, in particular for warm metal-poor stars. It\nis found that these effects depend on the temperature. For warm metal-poor\nstars, the NLTE abundance correction reaches ~ 0.2 dex relative to standard LTE\ncalculations. Our results indicate that Si is overabundant for metal-poor\nstars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2009 15:03:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}
