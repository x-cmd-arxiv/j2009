We investigate the constraints that are\nimposed by the observed optical depth of the Universe and the measured\ntemperature of the intergalactic gas. We find that the bounds are significant,\nand have the power to rule out large portions of the `DM mass/cross section'\nparameter space. The optical depth bound is generally stronger and does not\ndepend significantly on the history of structure formation. The temperature\nbound can be competitive in some cases for small masses or the hadronic\nannihilation channels (and is affected somewhat by the details of structure\nformation). We find in particular that DM particles with a large annihilation\ncross section into leptons and a few TeV mass, such as those needed to explain\nthe PAMELA and FERMI+HESS cosmic ray excesses in terms of Dark Matter, are\nruled out as they produce too many free electrons. We also find that low mass\nparticles (<~ 10 GeV) tend to heat too much the gas and are therefore\ndisfavored.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jul 2009 20:37:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2009 08:39:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-20"}

The fact that such\nshocks can exist at all in ADAF disks is a new result. Interestingly, we find\nthat isothermal shocks can form even when the level of viscous dissipation is\nrelatively high. In order to better understand this phenomenon, we explore all\npossible combinations of the fundamental flow parameters, such as specific\nenergy, specific angular momentum, and viscosity, to obtain the complete family\nof global solutions. This procedure allows us to identify the region of the\nparameter space where isothermal shocks can exist in viscous ADAF disks. The\nallowed region is maximized in the inviscid case, and it shrinks as the level\nof viscous dissipation increases. Adopting the canonical value gamma=1.5 for\nthe ratio of specific heats, we find that the shock region disappears\ncompletely when the Shakura-Sunyaev viscosity parameter alpha exceeds the\ncritical value ~0.27. This establishes for the first time that steady ADAF\ndisks containing shocks can exist even for relatively high levels of viscous\ndissipation. If an isothermal shock is present in the disk, it would have\nimportant implications for the acceleration of energetic particles that can\nescape to power the relativistic jets commonly observed around underfed,\nradio-loud black holes.

The\nsimulations are used to construct a semi-analytic model of the motion of the\nMBH in a time-varying triaxial Navarro-Frenk-White dark matter halo plus a\nspherical stellar bulge, where the dynamical friction force is calculated\ndirectly from the velocity dispersion tensor.

However, calculating the centrality of a node is often difficult\nbecause of the overwhelming size of the network or the incomplete information\nabout the network. Thus, developing an approximation method for estimating\ncentrality measures is needed.

This result generalizes a previous result due to\nMolino for the particular case of a singular Riemannian foliation whose leaves\nwere the closure of leaves of a regular Riemannian foliation. We also prove\nthat, if the leaves of the s.r.f are compact, then, for each small epsilon, the\nregular foliation can be chosen so that the desingularization map induces an\nepsilon-isometry between the leaf space of the regular Riemannian foliation and\nthe leaf space of the s.r.f. This implies in particular that, the leaf space of\nthe s.r.f is is a Gromov-Hausdorff limit of a sequence of Riemannian orbifolds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2009 00:45:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-14"}

Theoretical modeling, on the other hand, raises several\nquestions. Firstly, dust coagulation occurs so rapidly, that if the small dust\ngrains are not replenished by collisional fragmentation of dust aggregates,\nmost disks should be observed to be dust poor, which is not the case. Secondly,\nif dust aggregates grow to sizes of the order of centimeters to meters, they\ndrift so fast inwards, that they are quickly lost.\n  Aims: We attempt to verify if collisional fragmentation of dust aggregates is\neffective enough to keep disks 'dusty' by replenishing the population of small\ngrains and by preventing excessive radial drift.\n  Methods: With a new and sophisticated implicitly integrated coagulation and\nfragmentation modeling code, we solve the combined problem of coagulation,\nfragmentation, turbulent mixing and radial drift and at the same time solve for\nthe 1-D viscous gas disk evolution.\n  Results: We find that for a critical collision velocity of 1 m/s, as\nsuggested by laboratory experiments, the fragmentation is so effective, that at\nall times the dust is in the form of relatively small particles. This means\nthat radial drift is small and that large amounts of small dust particles\nremain present for a few million years, as observed. For a critical velocity of\n10 m/s, we find that particles grow about two orders of magnitude larger, which\nleads again to significant dust loss since larger particles are more strongly\naffected by radial drift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2009 14:02:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2009 12:53:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-21"}

During this migration process, they may face absolute boundaries to\ndispersal, because of external environmental factors. Consequently, not only\nthe position, but also the shape of the climate envelope can be modified. We\nuse a reaction-diffusion model to analyse the effects on population persistence\nof simultaneous changes in the climate envelope position and shape. When the\ngrowth term is of logistic type, we show that extinction and persistence are\nprincipally conditioned by the species mobility and the speed of climate\nchange, but not by the shape of the climate envelope. However, with a growth\nterm taking an Allee effect into account, we find a high sensitivity to the\nvariations of the shape of the climate envelope. In this case, the species\nwhich have a high mobility, although they could more easily follow the\nmigration of the climate envelope, would be at risk of extinction when\nencountering a local narrowing of the boundary geometry.

A simple guidance case and two density profiles which satisfactorily fit\nto observations or simulations, are studied in detail.
