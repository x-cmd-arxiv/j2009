We have obtained for this purpose high-quality spectra\nwith the Keck-LRIS spectrograph of red-envelope galaxies in 24 galaxy clusters\nin the redshift range 0.2 < z < 1.0. We complement these Keck spectra with\nhigh-quality, publicly available archival spectra from the SPICES and VVDS\nsurveys. We improve over our previous expansion history measurements in Simon\net al. (2005) by providing two new determinations of the expansion history:\nH(z) = 97 +- 62 km/sec/Mpc at z = 0.5 and H(z) = 90 +- 40 km/sec/Mpc at z =\n0.8. We discuss the uncertainty in the expansion history determination that\narises from uncertainties in the synthetic stellar-population models. We then\nuse these new measurements in concert with cosmic-microwave-background (CMB)\nmeasurements to constrain cosmological parameters, with a special emphasis on\ndark-energy parameters and constraints to the curvature. In particular, we\ndemonstrate the usefulness of direct H(z) measurements by constraining the\ndark- energy equation of state parameterized by w0 and wa and allowing for\narbitrary curvature. Further, we also constrain, using only CMB and H(z) data,\nthe number of relativistic degrees of freedom to be 4 +- 0.5 and their total\nmass to be < 0.2 eV, both at 1-sigma.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jul 2009 16:00:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Special attention is\ngiven to the As-Se binary, a system that displays a rich variety of aging\nbehavior intimately tied to sample synthesis conditions and the ambient\nenvironment in which samples are aged. Calorimetric (Modulated DSC) and Raman\nscattering experiments are undertaken. Our results show all samples display a\nsub-Tg endotherm below Tg in glassy networks possessing a mean coordination\nnumber r in the 2.25 < r < 2.45 range. Two sets of AsxSe1-x samples aged for 8\nyears were compared, set A consisted of slow cooled samples aged in the dark,\nand set B consisted of melt quenched samples aged at laboratory environment.\nSamples of set B in the As concentration range, 35% < x < 60%, display a pre-Tg\nexotherm, but the feature is not observed in samples of set A. The aging\nbehavior of set A presumably represents intrinsic aging in these glasses, while\nthat of set B is extrinsic due to presence of light. The reversibility window\npersists in both sets of samples but is less well defined in set B. These\nfindings contrast with a recent study by Golovchak et al., which finds the\nonset of the reversibility window moved up to the stoichiometric composition (x\n= 40%). Here we show that the upshifted window is better understood as\nresulting due to demixing of As4Se4 and As4Se3 molecules from the backbone,\ni.e., Nanoscale phase separation (NSPS). We attribute sub-Tg endotherms to\ncompaction of the flexible part of networks upon long term aging, while the\npre-Tg exotherm to NSPS. Finally, the narrowing and sharpening of the\nreversibility window upon aging is interpreted as the slow 'self-organizing'\nstress relaxation of the phases just outside the Intermediate phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jul 2009 18:58:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2010 22:44:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

This\nconnection persists in the limit in which gravity can be consistently\ndecoupled. We demonstrate this effect for orbifold planes, as well as for the\nsolitonic branes and string theoretic D-branes. In all cases the emergence of a\n4D strong coupling scale from bulk holography is a persistent phenomenon. The\neffect turns out to be insensitive even to such extreme deformations of the\nbrane action that seemingly shield 4D theory from the bulk gravity effects. A\nwell understood example of such deformation is given by large 4D Einstein term\nin the 3-brane action, which is known to suppress the strength of 5D gravity at\nshort distances and change the 5D Newton's law into the four-dimensional one.\nNevertheless, we observe that the scale at which the scalar polarization of an\neffective 4D-graviton becomes strongly coupled is again set by the bulk\nholographic scale. The effect persist in the gravity decoupling limit, when the\nfull theory reduces to a 4D system in which the only memory about the\nhigh-dimensional holography is encoded in the strong coupling scale. The\nobserved intrinsic connection between the high-dimensional flat space\nholography and 4D strong coupling suggests a possible guideline for\ngeneralization of AdS/CFT duality to other systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jul 2009 18:22:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-21"}

While all members of the group appear to display the\ncanonical traits of first crossers of the instability strip, Polaris has one\nunique peculiarity: a brief hiatus in its monotonic period increment between\n1963 and 1966 during which the pulsation period underwent a dramatic decrease.\nHas the average brightness of the Cepheid also increased over the last\nmillennium?\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jul 2009 21:33:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

On the\nother hand, a significant fraction of stars is supposed to be born as binaries\nwith circumbinary disk that are frequently observed. Here, we investigate the\nevolution of a magnetized rotating cloud using three-dimensional resistive MHD\nnested-grid code, and show that the outflow is driven by the circumbinary disk\nand has an important role even in the binary formation. After the adiabatic\ncore formation in the collapsing cloud core, the magnetic flux is significantly\nremoved from the centre of the cloud by the Ohmic dissipation. Since this\nremoval makes the magnetic braking ineffective, the adiabatic core continuously\nacquires the angular momentum to induce fragmentation and subsequent binary\nformation. The magnetic field accumulates in the circumbinary disk where the\nremoval and accretion of magnetic field are balanced, and finally drives\ncircumbinary outflow. This result explains the spectacular morphology of some\nspecific young stellar objects such as L1551 IRS5. We can infer that most of\nthe bipolar molecular outflows observed by low density tracers (i.e., CO) would\ncorrespond to circumbinary or circum-multiple outflows found in this report,\nsince most of the young stellar objects are supposed to be binaries or\nmultiples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jul 2009 05:55:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

We study three typical star-forming galaxies in haloes of approx. 5 10^11\nMsun at z=2.3, when they were not undergoing a major merger. The steady gas\nsupply by cold streams leads to gravitationally unstable, turbulent discs,\nwhich fragment into giant clumps and transient features on a dynamical\ntimescale. The disc clumps are not associated with dark-matter haloes. The\nclumpy discs are self-regulated by gravity in a marginaly unstable state. Clump\nmigration and angular-momentum transfer on an orbital timescale help the growth\nof a central bulge with a mass comparable to the disc. The continuous gas input\nkeeps the system of clumpy disc and bulge in a near \"steady state\", for several\nGyr. The average star-formation rate, much of which occurs in the clumps,\nfollows the gas accretion rate of approx. 45 Msun/yr.

It\nis shown that when the variation of Bernoulli's function in the upstream is\nsufficiently small and mass flux is in a suitable regime with an upper critical\nvalue, then there exists a unique global subsonic solution in a suitable class\nfor a general variable nozzle. One of the main difficulties for the general\nsteady Euler flows, the governing equations are a mixed elliptic-hyperbolic\nsystem even for uniformly subsonic flows. A key point in our theory is to use a\nstream function formulation for compressible Euler equations. By this\nformulation, Euler equations are equivalent to a quasilinear second order\nequation for a stream function so that the hyperbolicity of the particle path\nis already involved. The existence of solution to the boundary value problem\nfor stream function is obtained with the help of the estimate for elliptic\nequation of two variables. The asymptotic behavior for the stream function is\nobtained via a blow up argument and energy estimates. This asymptotic behavior,\ntogether with some refined estimates on the stream function, yields the\nconsistency of the stream function formulation and thus the original Euler\nequations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jul 2009 12:55:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-21"}

This paper concerns the evolution of the\nprisoner's dilemma game on regular lattices with three different types of\nneighborhoods -- the von Neumann-, Moore-, and kagome types. We investigate two\nkinds of dynamics for the players to update their strategies (that can be\nunconditional cooperator or defector). Depending on the payoff difference, an\nindividual can adopt the strategy of a random neighbor (a voter-model-like\ndynamics, VMLD), or impose its strategy on a random neighbor, i.e.,\ninvasion-like dynamics (IPLD). In particular, we focus on the effects of noise,\nin combination with the strategy dynamics, on the evolution of cooperation. We\nfind that VMLD, compared to IPLD, better supports the spreading and sustaining\nof cooperation. We see that noise has nontrivial effects on the evolution of\ncooperation: maximum cooperation density can be realized either at a medium\nnoise level, in the limit of zero noise, or in both these regions. The\ntemptation to defect and the local interaction structure determine the outcome.\nEspecially, in the low noise limit, the local interaction plays a crucial role\nin determining the fate of cooperators.

In\nparticular CREAM allowed to measure B/C, C/O and N/O up to 1 TeV and PAMELA the\nanti-p/p ratio up to 100 GeV with unprecedented accuracy. These measurements\noffer a valuable probe of CR propagation properties. We performed a statistical\nanalysis to test the compatibility of these results, as well as other most\nsignificant experimental data, with the predictions of a new numerical CR\ndiffusion package (DRAGON). We found that above 1 GeV all data are consistent\nwith a diffusion scenario in a well defined range of values of the diffusion\ncoefficient energy power index and normalization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jul 2009 13:35:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 2009 09:05:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}

We argue that one has to\ndistinguish between two ways of averaging (the annealed and the quenched cases)\ndepending on whether we let the initial condition fluctuate or not. Although\nthe initial condition is not a steady state, the distribution of the current\nsatisfies a symmetry very reminiscent of the fluctuation theorem. We show how\nthe equations of the MFT can be solved in the case of non-interacting\nparticles. The symmetry of these equations can be used to deduce the\ndistribution of the current for several other models, from its knowledge for\nthe symmetric simple exclusion process. In the range where the integrated\ncurrent $Q_t \\sim \\sqrt{t}$, we show that the non-Gaussian decay $\\exp [-\nQ_t^3/t]$ of the distribution of $Q_t$ is generic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jul 2009 14:46:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2009 11:11:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The redundancy of such representations\nis often directly related to the computational load of any algorithm operating\nin the transform domain. To reduce complexity, it may be desirable to increase\nthe time and frequency sampling intervals beyond the point where the transform\nis invertible, at the cost of an inevitable recovery error. In this paper we\ninitiate the study of recovery procedures for non-invertible Gabor\nrepresentations. We propose using fixed analysis and synthesis windows, chosen\ne.g. according to implementation constraints, and to process the Gabor\ncoefficients prior to synthesis in order to shape the reconstructed signal. We\ndevelop three methods to tackle this problem. The first follows from the\nconsistency requirement, namely that the recovered signal has the same Gabor\nrepresentation as the input signal. The second, is based on the minimization of\na worst-case error criterion. Last, we develop a recovery technique based on\nthe assumption that the input signal lies in some subspace of $L_2$. We show\nthat for each of the criteria, the manipulation of the transform coefficients\namounts to a 2D twisted convolution operation, which we show how to perform\nusing a filter-bank. When the under-sampling factor is an integer, the\nprocessing reduces to standard 2D convolution. We provide simulation results to\ndemonstrate the advantages and weaknesses of each of the algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jul 2009 15:35:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}
