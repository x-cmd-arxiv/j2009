Prompt\nimages and spectra are obtained with a co-aligned soft X-ray telescope (SXI;\n0.1 - 10keV) and with a 1.1m optical-IR telescope (IRT) simultaneously in 4\nbands (0.3 - 0.52micron, 0.52 - 0.9micron, 0.9 - 1.38micron, and 1.38 -\n2.3micron). An initial image (100s) will yield prompt identification within the\nHET error circle from a <2\" prompt SXI position; or from VIS vs. IR dropouts or\nvariability. An autonomous spacecraft re-point (<30\") will then put the GRB on\na 0.3\" x 4\" slit for either R = 3000 (for AB <21) or R =30 (for AB ~21-25)\nprompt spectra over the 0.3 - 0.9 micron and 0.9 - 2.3 micron bands. This will\nprovide onboard redshifts within ~500-2000sec for most GRBs, reaching z ~20\n(for Lyman-alpha breaks) if such GRBs exist, and spectra for studies of the\nhost galaxy and local re-ionization patchiness as well as intervening cosmic\nstructure. With ~600 GRBs/yr expected, including ~7-10% expected at z >7, EXIST\nwill open a new era in studies of the early Universe as well as carry out a\nrich program of AGN and transient-source science. An overview of the GRB\nscience objectives and a brief discussion of the overall mission design and\noperations is given, and example high-z GRB IRT spectra are shown.

We\nexplore the problem of whether star formation in low mass dark halos (< 10^{7}\nM_sun) was triggered or suppressed by the SN feedback from neighboring\nstar-forming halos. We take into consideration mainly two effects by the SN\nshock: one is the evacuation of gas components from the halos and the other is\nthe promotion of H_2 formation because of the enhanced ionization degree by\nshock heating. Combining above effects, we find that the star formation\nactivities in the neighboring dark matter halos (M < 10^{7} M_sun) are\nbasically suppressed in case they are located close to the SN center, because\nof the gas evacuation effect. The critical distance within which the gas is\nblown away falls within the range $\\sim 0.3-1.5$kpc depending on the SN energy\nand the halo mass.

On\nCT data from ten previously-treated patients new catheters were digitized\nfollowing three catheter patterns: conical, bi-conical, and fireworks. The\nconical patterns were used to accommodate a robotic delivery using a single\nentry point.

The analysis reveals an overabundance of He, N, and Na, and a\ndepletion of H, C, and O, on the surface of AG Car, indicating the presence of\nCNO-processed material. Furthermore, the ratio N/O is higher on the stellar\nsurface than in the nebula. We found that the minimum phases of AG Car are not\nequal to each other, since we derived a noticeable difference between the\nmaximum effective temperature achieved during 1985-1990 (22,800 K) and\n2000-2001 (17,000 K). While the wind terminal velocity was 300 km/s in\n1985-1990, it was as low as 105 km/s in 2001. The mass-loss rate, however, was\nlower from 1985-1990 (1.5 x 10^(-5) Msun/yr) than from 2000-2001 (3.7 x 10^(-5)\nMsun/yr). We found that the wind of AG Car is significantly clumped (f=0.10 -\n0.25) and that clumps must be formed deep in the wind. We derived a bolometric\nluminosity of 1.5 x 10^6 Lsun during both minimum phases which, contrary to the\ncommon assumption, decreases to 1.0 x 10^6 Lsun as the star moves towards\nmaximum flux in the V band. Assuming that the decrease in the bolometric\nluminosity of AG Car is due to the energy used to expand the outer layers of\nthe star (Lamers 1995), we found that the expanding layers contain roughly 0.6\n- 2 Msun. Such an amount of mass is an order of magnitude lower than the\nnebular mass around AG Car, but is comparable to the nebular mass found around\nlower-luminosity LBVs and to that of the Little Homunculus of Eta Car. If such\na large amount of mass is indeed involved in the S Dor-type variability, we\nspeculate that such instability could be a failed Giant Eruption, with several\nsolar masses never becoming unbound from the star.(abridged)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2009 17:25:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

A standard approach to reconstruct the energy of an ultra-high\nenergy cosmic rays is to sample the lateral profile of the particle density on\nthe ground of the air shower with an array of surface detectors. For cosmic\nrays with large inclinations, this reconstruction is based on a model of the\nlateral profile of the muon density observed on the ground, which is fitted to\nthe observed muon densities in individual surface detectors. The best models\nfor this task are derived from detailed Monte-Carlo simulations of the air\nshower development.

There is recent\nwork extending the celebrated max--flow/min--cut theorem to the capacity of a\nunicast session over a linear deterministic relay network which is modeled by a\nlayered directed graph.

The\napparent reflection of each soliton at the boundary of the spatial domain is\ndue to the presence of a \"mirror\" soliton, with equal amplitude and opposite\nvelocity, located beyond the boundary. We then calculate the position shift of\nthe physical solitons as a result of the nonlinear reflection. These results\nprovide a nonlinear analogue of the method of images that is used to solve\nboundary value problems in electrostatics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2009 22:29:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2009 14:50:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Combining the\ndata with the Swift-XRT and Suzaku data, we modelled the outburst decay over\n160 days, and we found that the source flux decreased exponentially with a\ntimescale of t_c=23.8 days. In the first XMM-Newton observation a large number\nof short X-ray bursts were observed, the rate of which decayed drastically in\nthe following observations. We found large changes in the spectral and timing\nbehavior of the source during the outburst, with softening emission as the flux\ndecayed, and the non-thermal soft X-ray spectral component fading faster than\nthe thermal one. Almost simultaneously to our XMM-Newton observations (on 2008\nAugust 29 and September 2), we observed the source in the hard X-ray range with\nINTEGRAL, which clearly detected the source up to ~100keV in the first\npointing, while giving only upper limits during the second pointing,\ndiscovering a variable hard X-ray component fading in less than 10 days after\nthe bursting activation.

A tag may be\nmissing (left unread) due to errors in the communication link towards the\nreader e.g. due to obstacles in the radio path. The present paper proposes\ntechniques that use multiple reader sessions, during which the system of\nreaders obtains a running estimate of the probability to have at least one tag\nmissing. Based on such an estimate, it is decided whether an additional reader\nsession is required. Two methods are proposed, they rely on the statistical\nindependence of the tag reading errors across different reader sessions, which\nis a plausible assumption when e.g. each reader session is executed on\ndifferent readers. The first method uses statistical relationships that are\nvalid when the reader sessions are independent. The second method is obtained\nby modifying an existing capture-recapture estimator. The results show that,\nwhen the reader sessions are independent, the proposed mechanisms provide a\ngood approximation to the probability of missing tags, such that the number of\nreader sessions made, meets the target specification.

The self-intermediate function and the autocorrelation\nfunctions of pressure and shear stress are analyzed; the obtained fits are very\ngood, at least as good as with a stretched exponential. In contrast to the\nstretched exponential, the key shape parameter--the exponent of the power-law\ntail--seems to be the same for all three correlation functions. It decreases\nfrom a value around 2 at high temperature to a value close to 1.58 (2D), 1.50\n(3D) at low temperatures. The amplitude of the tail increases towards towards a\nvalue corresponding to a diverging relaxation time, which is related to\nanomalous diffusion. On the other hand, careful analysis of the long time\nbehavior in the case of suggests that the memory function is cut-off\nexponentially, which avoids the divergence of the relaxation time.

OC-MDPs are equivalent to a controlled extension of\n(discrete-time) Quasi-Birth-Death processes (QBDs), a stochastic model studied\nheavily in queueing theory and applied probability. They can thus be viewed as\na natural ``adversarial'' version of a classic stochastic model. Alternatively,\nthey can also be viewed as a natural probabilistic/controlled extension of\nclassic one-counter automata. OC-MDPs also subsume (as a very restricted\nspecial case) a recently studied MDP model called ``solvency games'' that model\na risk-averse gambling scenario. Basic computational questions about these\nmodels include ``termination'' questions and ``limit'' questions, such as the\nfollowing: does the controller have a ``strategy'' (or ``policy'') to ensure\nthat the counter (which may for example count the number of jobs in the queue)\nwill hit value 0 (the empty queue) almost surely (a.s.)? Or that it will have\ninfinite limsup value, a.s.? Or, that it will hit value 0 in selected terminal\nstates, a.s.? Or, in case these are not satisfied a.s., compute the maximum\n(supremum) such probability over all strategies. We provide new upper and lower\nbounds on the complexity of such problems.

In this paper, with examples from the canonical scalar field as well\nas the tachyonic models, we illustrate that, in punctuated inflation, a drop in\nthe scalar power on large scales is {\\it always} accompanied by a rise in the\ntensor power and, hence, an even more pronounced increase in the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ on these scales.

We analyse the origin of the correlation in question and show it to be\na direct consequence of the stringent experimental constraint on epsilon_K,\nprovided that the NP enters with comparable strength and a universal weak phase\nin both Delta S = 2 and Delta S = 1 transitions. This happens in many NP\nscenarios with either only SM operators, or where the NP induces exclusively\nright-handed currents while the left-right Delta S = 2 operators are absent. On\nthe other hand, if the NP phases in Delta S = 2 and Delta S = 1 processes are\nuncorrelated, epsilon_K has no power to put constraints on the K -> pi nu\nanti-nu system. The latter appears in particular in those NP models where K^0 -\nanti-K^0 mixing receives contributions from the chirally enhanced left-right\noperators. We discuss the stability of the correlation in question against\nsmall deviations from the assumption of universal Delta S = 2 and Delta S = 1\nweak phases, and in the presence of non-negligible NP contributions to\nepsilon_K.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2009 15:52:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Aug 2009 13:32:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-12"}

A preference for spiral galaxies in one sector of the sky to be\nleft-handed or right-handed spirals would indicate a parity-violating asymmetry\nin the overall universe and a preferred axis. The previous study used 2616\nspiral galaxies with redshifts <0.04 and identified handedness. The new study\nuses 15158 with redshifts <0.085 and obtains very similar results to the first\nwith a signal exceeding 5 sigma, corresponding to a probability ~2.5x10-7 for\noccurring by chance. A similar asymmetry is seen in the Southern Galaxy spin\ncatalog of Iye and Sugai. The axis of the dipole asymmetry lies at approx.
