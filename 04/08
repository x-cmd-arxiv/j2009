Such a \"standard siren\" (the GW\nanalog of a standard candle) would provide an excellent probe of the relatively\nnearby universe's expansion, complementing other standard candles. In this\npaper, we examine binary measurement using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique\nto build the probability distributions describing measured parameters. We\nassume that each SHB observation gives both sky position and the time of\ncoalescence, and we take both binary neutron stars and black hole-neutron star\ncoalescences as plausible SHB progenitors. We examine how well parameters\nparticularly distance) can be measured from GW observations of SHBs by a range\nof ground-based detector networks. We find that earlier estimates overstate how\nwell distances can be measured, even at fairly large signal-to-noise ratio. The\nfundamental limitation to determining distance proves to be a degeneracy\nbetween distance and source inclination. Overcoming this limitation requires\nthat we either break this degeneracy, or measure enough sources to broadly\nsample the inclination distribution.

In contrast to\nprevious studies, we find that viable dark matter candidates with electroweak\nscale masses can naturally provide the dominant contribution to the\nreionization of the universe. Intriguingly, we find that dark matter candidates\ncapable of producing the recent cosmic ray excesses observed by PAMELA and/or\nATIC are also predicted to lead to the full reionization of the universe by z ~\n6.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2009 20:05:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Apr 2009 20:12:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-02"}

For these applications, the underline mathematical\nmodel is multiple sequences sets (MSS). Though there is increasing use of MSS,\nthere is little research on how to process MSS efficiently. To process multiple\nsequences sets, sequences are first distributed to different sets, and then\nsequences for each set are processed.

The generality of this\npicture has now been studied by use of low-energy electron microscopy (LEEM) to\nobserve graphene formation when Ru(0001) and Ir(111) surfaces are exposed to\nethylene. The finding that graphene growth velocities and nucleation rates on\nRu have precisely the same dependence on adatom concentration as for elemental\nC deposition implies that hydrocarbon decomposition only affects graphene\ngrowth through the rate of adatom formation; for ethylene, that rate decreases\nwith increasing adatom concentration and graphene coverage.

In the later stages of growth, graphene crystals that are rotated\nrelative to the initial nuclei nucleate and grow. The rotated nuclei grow much\nfaster. This difference suggests first, that the edge-orientation of the\ngraphene sheets relative to the substrate plays an important role in the growth\nmechanism, and second, that attachment of the clusters to the graphene is the\nslowest step in cluster addition, rather than formation of clusters on the\nterraces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Apr 2009 01:42:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-14"}

Such states are\npossible because their light-like electrons come in spin pairs that are\nchiral,which means that their direction of propagation is tied to a quantity\ncalled pseudospin that describes their location in the crystal lattice. An\nemerging direction in quantum materials research is the manipulation of atomic\nspin-orbit coupling to simulate the effect of a spin dependent magnetic\nfield,in attempt to realize novel spin phases of matter. This effect has been\nproposed to realize systems consisting of unpaired Dirac cones that are\nhelical, meaning their direction of propagation is tied to the electron spin\nitself, which are forbidden to exist in graphene or bismuth. The experimental\nexistence of topological order can not be determined without spin-resolved\nmeasurements. Here we report a spin-and angle-resolved photoemission study of\nthe hexagonal surface of the Bi2Te3 and Bi{2-x}MnxTe3 series, which is found to\nexhibit a single helical Dirac cone that is fully spin-polarized.

Conventional matching\nalgorithms are not necessarily secure against strong intentional impersonation\nattacks such as wolf attacks. The wolf attack is an attempt to impersonate a\ngenuine user by presenting a \"wolf\" to a biometric authentication system\nwithout the knowledge of a genuine user's biometric sample. A wolf is a sample\nwhich can be accepted as a match with multiple templates. The wolf attack\nprobability (WAP) is the maximum success probability of the wolf attack, which\nwas proposed by Une, Otsuka, Imai as a measure for evaluating security of\nbiometric authentication systems. We present a principle for construction of\nsecure matching algorithms against the wolf attack for any biometric\nauthentication systems. The ideal matching algorithm determines a threshold for\neach input value depending on the entropy of the probability distribution of\nthe (Hamming) distances. Then we show that if the information about the\nprobability distribution for each input value is perfectly given, then our\nmatching algorithm is secure against the wolf attack. Our generalized matching\nalgorithm gives a theoretical framework to construct secure matching\nalgorithms. How lower WAP is achievable depends on how accurately the entropy\nis estimated. Then there is a trade-off between the efficiency and the\nachievable WAP. Almost every conventional matching algorithm employs a fixed\nthreshold and hence it can be regarded as an efficient but insecure instance of\nour theoretical framework.

However, in\nmany problems of practical interest these techniques demand procedures for\nsampling from probability distributions with non-standard forms, hence we are\noften brought back to the consideration of fundamental simulation algorithms,\nsuch as rejection sampling (RS). Unfortunately, the use of RS techniques\ndemands the calculation of tight upper bounds for the ratio of the target\nprobability density function (pdf) over the proposal density from which\ncandidate samples are drawn. Except for the class of log-concave target pdf's,\nfor which an efficient algorithm exists, there are no general methods to\nanalytically determine this bound, which has to be derived from scratch for\neach specific case. In this paper, we introduce new schemes for (a) obtaining\nupper bounds for likelihood functions and (b) adaptively computing proposal\ndensities that approximate the target pdf closely. The former class of methods\nprovides the tools to easily sample from a posteriori probability distributions\n(that appear very often in signal processing problems) by drawing candidates\nfrom the prior distribution. However, they are even more useful when they are\nexploited to derive the generalized adaptive RS (GARS) algorithm introduced in\nthe second part of the paper.

Intrinsic sparsity of distribution of clutter and target energy on\nspatial-frequency plane was exploited from the viewpoint of compressed sensing.\nThe original sample data and distribution of target and clutter energy was\nconnected by a ill-posed linear algebraic equation and popular $L_1$\noptimization method could be utilized to search for its solution with sparse\ncharacteristic. Several new filtering algorithm acting on this solution were\ndesigned to clean clutter component on spatial-frequency plane effectively for\ndetecting invisible targets buried in clutter. The method above is called\nCS-STAP in general. CS-STAP showed their advantage compared with conventional\nSTAP technique, such as SMI, in two ways: Firstly, the resolution of CS-STAP on\nestimation for distribution of clutter and target energy is ultra-high such\nthat clutter energy might be annihilated almost completely by carefully tuned\nfilter. Output SCR of CS-STAP algorithms is far superior to the requirement of\ndetection; Secondly, a much smaller size of training sample support compared\nwith SMI method is requested for CS-STAP method. Even with only one snapshot\n(from target range cell) could CS-STAP method be able to reveal the existence\nof target clearly. CS-STAP method display its great potential to be used in\nheterogeneous situation. Experimental result on dataset from mountaintop\nprogram has provided the evidence for our assertion on CS-STAP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Apr 2009 11:58:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-09"}

We initially\nassume T-invariance by taking the up and down-quark 4x4 mass matrix to be real.\nFollowing Friedberg and Lee (FL), we then impose a \"hidden\" symmetry on the\nunobserved (\"hidden\") up and down-quark SU(2) states. The hidden symmetry for\nfour generations ensures the existence of two zero-mass eigenstates, which we\ntake to be the (u,c) and (d,s) states in the up and down-quark sectors,\nrespectively. Then, we simultaneously break T-invariance and the hidden\nsymmetry by introducing two phase factors in each sector. This breaking\nmechanism generates the small quark masses m_u, m_c and m_d, m_s which, along\nwith the orientation of the hidden symmetry, determine the size of CP-violation\nin the SM4. For illustration we choose a specific physical picture for the\nhidden symmetry and the breaking mechanism that reproduces the observed quark\nmasses, mixing angles and CP-violation, and at the same time allows us to\nfurther obtain very interesting relations/predictions for the mixing angles of\nt and t'. For example, with this choice we get V_{td} ~ (V_{cb}/V_{cd} -\nV_{ts}/V_{us}) + O(\\lambda^2) and V_{t'b} ~ V_{t'd}x(V_{cb}/V_{cd}), V_{tb'} ~\nV_{t'd}x(V_{ts}/V_{us}), implying that V_{t'd} > V_{t'b},V_{tb'}.

We contend that a single,\nspecific ranking function may not suffice for probabilistic databases, and we\ninstead propose two parameterized ranking functions, called PRF-w and PRF-e,\nthat generalize or can approximate many of the previously proposed ranking\nfunctions. We present novel generating functions-based algorithms for\nefficiently ranking large datasets according to these ranking functions, even\nif the datasets exhibit complex correlations modeled using probabilistic\nand/xor trees or Markov networks. We further propose that the parameters of the\nranking function be learned from user preferences, and we develop an approach\nto learn those parameters. Finally, we present a comprehensive experimental\nstudy that illustrates the effectiveness of our parameterized ranking\nfunctions, especially PRF-e, at approximating other ranking functions and the\nscalability of our proposed algorithms for exact or approximate ranking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Apr 2009 15:30:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2009 04:42:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2010 19:25:42 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2010 21:12:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-17"}

In this work we report a methodology capable of\ncharacterizing the time behavior of these variable objects. The Maximum\nLikelihood Blocks (MLBs) is a model-independent estimator which sub-divides the\nlight curve into time blocks, whose length and amplitude are compatible with\nstates of constant emission rate of the observed source. The MLBs yields the\nstatistical significance in the rate variations and strongly suppresses the\nnoise fluctuations in the light curves. We apply the MLBs for the first time on\nthe long term X-ray light curves (RXTE/ASM) of Mkn~421,Mkn~501, 1ES 1959+650\nand 1ES 2155-304, which consist of more than 10 years of observational data\n(1996-2007). Using the MLBs interpretation of RXTE/ASM data, the integrated\ntime flux distribution is determined for each single source considered. We\nidentify in these distributions the characteristic level as well as the flaring\nstates of the blazars. All the distributions show a significant component at\nnegative flux values, most probably caused by an uncertainty in the background\nsubtraction and by intrinsic fluctuations of RXTE/ASM. This effect interests in\nparticular short time observations. In order to quantify the probability that\nthe intrinsic fluctuations give rise to a false identification of a flare, we\nstudy a population of very faint sources and their integrated time flux\ndistribution.
