We show that the collective mode spectrum of this superfluid exhibits,\nin addition to the long wavelength sound mode, a sharp roton mode over a wide\nrange of densities and interaction strengths. We compute the sound velocity and\nthe roton gap within a generalized random phase approximation (GRPA) and show\nthat the GRPA results are in good agreement, at strong coupling, with a spin\nwave analysis of the appropriate strong-coupling pseudospin model. We also\ninvestigate, using this two-pronged approach, the breakdown of superfluidity in\nthe presence of a supercurrent. We find that the superflow can break down at a\ncritical flow momentum via several distinct mechanisms - depairing, Landau\ninstabilities or dynamical instabilities - depending on the dimensionality, the\ninteraction strength and the fermion density. The most interesting of these\ninstabilities is a charge modulation dynamical instability which is distinct\nfrom previously studied dynamical instabilities of Bose superfluids. The charge\norder associated with this instability can be of two types: (i) a commensurate\ncheckerboard modulation driven by softening of the roton mode at the Brillouin\nzone corner, or, (ii) an incommensurate density modulation arising from\nsuperflow-induced finite momentum pairing of Bogoliubov quasiparticles.

Joule\nheating associated with the currents driven by the synthetic electric field\ndominates the intrinsic damping, caused by the electron-phonon interaction, of\nmany acoustic phonon modes of graphene and metallic carbon nanotubes when\nincluding the effects of disorder and Coulomb interactions. Several important\nconsequences follow from the observation that by time-reversal symmetry, the\nsynthetic electric field associated with the vector potential has opposite\nsigns for the two valleys. First, this implies that the synthetic electric\nfield drives charge-neutral valley currents and is therefore unaffected by\nscreening.

Second, valley currents decay by\nelectron-electron scattering (valley Coulomb drag) which causes interesting\ntemperature dependence of the damping rates.

Instead of probability vectors, agents strategies are now characterized\nby probability measures over continuous variables. As a result, the ordinary\ndifferential equations for the discrete case are replaced by a system of\ncoupled integral--differential replicator equations that describe the mutual\nevolution of individual agent strategies.

Roughly half\nthe data was taken through the Keck iodine cell which contains thousands of\nwell calibrated iodine lines.

These offsets correspond to an\nabsolute redshift of uncertainty of about Delta z=10^{-5} (Delta lambda= 0.02\nAng), with daily drifts of around Delta z=5x10^{-6} (Delta lambda =0.01 Ang),\nand multiday drifts of nearly Delta z=2x10^{-5} (0.04 Ang).

Ages can be estimated for the youngest\ncomplexes and correlated with azimuthal distances from the spiral arms defined\nby the K-band intensity variation. The extended sources with Mk <-12 mag\ndisplay a diffuse appearance and are more concentrated inside the arm region\nthan fainter ones, which are compact and uniformly distributed in the disk. The\nNIR colors of the bright diffuse objects are consistent with them being young\nstarforming complexes with ages <10 Myr and reddened by up to 8 mag of visual\nextinction. They show a color gradient as a function of their azimuthal\ndistance from the spiral arms. Interpreting this gradient as an age variation,\nthe pattern speed Op = 16 km/s/kpc of the main spiral was derived assuming\ncircular motion. The alignment and color gradient of the bright, diffuse\ncomplexes strongly support a density wave scenario for NGC 2997. Only the\nbrightest complexes with Mk <-12 mag show a well aligned structure along the\narm, suggesting that a strong compression in the gas due to the spiral\npotential is required to form these most massive aggregates, while smaller\nstarforming regions are formed more randomly in the disk.

In CDMA MIMO-based wireless packet access, multi-code transmission\nsuffers from severe performance degradation due to the loss of code\northogonality caused by both interchip interference (ICI) and co-antenna\ninterference (CAI). This limitation results in large transmission delays when\nan ARQ mechanism is used in the link layer. In this paper, we investigate\nefficient minimum mean square error (MMSE) frequency domain equalization\n(FDE)-based iterative (turbo) packet combining for cyclic prefix (CP)-CDMA MIMO\nwith Chase-type ARQ. We introduce two turbo packet combining schemes: i) In the\nfirst scheme, namely \"chip-level turbo packet combining\", MMSE FDE and packet\ncombining are jointly performed at the chip-level. ii) In the second scheme,\nnamely \"symbol-level turbo packet combining\", chip-level MMSE FDE and\ndespreading are separately carried out for each transmission, then packet\ncombining is performed at the level of the soft demapper. The computational\ncomplexity and memory requirements of both techniques are quite insensitive to\nthe ARQ delay, i.e., maximum number of ARQ rounds. The throughput is evaluated\nfor some representative antenna configurations and load factors to show the\ngains offered by the proposed techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2009 13:22:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

In\ncontrast, samples with x < 0.2 exhibit weak ferromagnetism only in magnetometry\nmeasurement which is absent in optical and electrical measurements. We\ndemonstrate, by systematic electrical transport studies that carrier\nlocalization indeed occurs below 20-50 K for samples with x < 0.2; however,\nthis does not lead to the formation of ferromagnetic phase in these samples\nwith an electron concentration in the range of 6 x 10(19) cm(-3) 1 x 10(20)\ncm(-3). Detailed structural and optical transmission spectroscopy analyses\nrevealed that the anomalous Hall effect observed in samples with x > 0.25 is\ndue to the formation of secondary phases and Co clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2009 12:32:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-01"}

We point out that a process like reheating at the end of\ninflation will inevitably generate perturbations, even on superhorizon scales,\nby the local diffusion of energy. Provided that the reheating temperature is of\norder the GUT scale, the density contrast $\\delta_R$ for spheres of radius $R$\nwill be of order $10^{-5}$ at horizon entry, consistent with the values\nmeasured by \\texttt{WMAP}. If this were a purely classical process,\n$\\delta_R^2$ would fall as $1/R^4$ beyond the horizon, and the resulting\nprimordial density power spectrum would be $P(k) \\propto k^n$ with $n=4$.\nHowever, as shown by Gabrielli et al, a quantum diffusion process can generate\na power spectrum with any index in the range $0<n\\leq 4$, including values\nclose to the observed $n=1$ ($\\delta_R^2$ will then be $\\propto 1/R^{3+n}$ for\n$n<1$ and $1/R^4$ for $n>1$). Thus, the two characteristic parameters that\ndetermine the appearance of present day structures could be natural\nconsequences of this mechanism. These are in any case the minimum density\nvariations that must have formed if the universe was rapidly heated to GUT\ntemperatures by the decay of a `false vacuum'. There is then no \\emph{a priori}\nnecessity to postulate additional (and fine tuned) quantum fluctuations in the\n`false vacuum', nor a pre-inflationary period.

In this paper we revisit the classical and well-studied push\nprotocol for message broadcasting. Assuming that initially only one node has\nsome piece of information, at each stage every one of the informed nodes\nchooses randomly and independently one of its neighbors and passes the message\nto it.\n  The performance of the push protocol on a fully connected network, where each\nnode is joined by a link to every other node, is very well understood. In\nparticular, Frieze and Grimmett proved that with probability 1-o(1) the push\nprotocol completes the broadcasting of the message within (1 +/- \\epsilon)\n(log_2 n + ln n) stages, where n is the number of nodes of the network.\nHowever, there are no tight bounds for the broadcast time on networks that are\nsignificantly sparser than the complete graph.\n  In this work we consider random networks on n nodes, where every edge is\npresent with probability p, independently of every other edge. We show that if\np > f(n)ln n/ n, where f(n) is any function that tends to infinity as n grows,\nthen the push protocol broadcasts the message within (1 +/- \\epsilon) (log_2 n\n+ ln n) stages with probability 1-o(1). In other words, in almost every network\nof density d such that d > f(n)ln n, the push protocol broadcasts a message as\nfast as in a fully connected network. This is quite surprising in the sense\nthat the time needed remains essentially unaffected by the fact that most of\nthe links are missing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2009 14:34:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-01"}

This\npaper proposes a new image deconvolution approach for images with Poisson\nstatistical models, with the following building blocks: (a) a standard\nregularization/MAP criterion, combining the Poisson log-likelihood with a\nregularizer (log-prior) is adopted; (b) the resulting optimization problem\n(which is difficult, since it involves a non-quadratic and non-separable term\nplus a non-smooth term) is transformed into an equivalent constrained problem,\nvia a variable splitting procedure; (c) this constrained problem is addressed\nusing an augmented Lagrangian framework. The effectiveness of the resulting\nalgorithm is illustrated in comparison with current state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2009 15:54:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-01"}
