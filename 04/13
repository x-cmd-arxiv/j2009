We aim to construct preconditioners that\nare robust with respect to the magnitude of the coefficient contrast and the\nmesh size simultaneously. For that, we prove and numerically demonstrate the\nrobustness of the preconditioner proposed by Aksoylu et al. (2008, Comput. Vis.\nSci. 11, pp. 319--331) by extending the devised singular perturbation analysis\nfrom linear finite element discretization to the above discretization. The\nsingular perturbation analysis is more involved than that of finite element\nbecause all the subblocks in the discretization matrix depend on the diffusion\ncoefficient. However, that dependence is eliminated asymptotically. This allows\nthe same preconditioner to be utilized due to similar limiting behaviours of\nthe submatrices; leading to a narrowing family of preconditioners that can be\nused for different discretizations--a desirable preconditioner design goal. We\ncompare our numerical results to standard cell-centered multigrid and observe\nthat performance of our preconditioner is independent of the utilized\nprolongation operators and smoothers.\n  As a side result, we also prove that the solution over the highly-diffusive\nisland becomes constant asymptotically. Integration of this qualitative\nunderstanding of the underlying PDE to our preconditioner is the main reason\nbehind its superior performance. Diagonal scaling is probably the most basic\npreconditioner for high-contrast coefficients.

Rev.\nLett., {\\bf 92}, 157203 (2004)] leads to an excellent description of such\ninhomogeneities. In the $\\ell-b$ model two very different kinds of electronic\nstates, one localized and polaronic ($\\ell$), and the other extended or broad\nband ($b$) co-exist. For model parameters appropriate to manganites, and even\nwithin a simple dynamical mean-filed theory (DMFT) framework, it describes many\nof the unusual phenomena seen in manganites, including colossal\nmagnetoresistance (CMR), qualitatively and quantitatively. However, in the\nabsence of long ranged Coulomb interaction, a system described by such a model\nwould actually phase separate, into macroscopic regions of $l$ and $b$\nelectrons respectively. As we show in this paper, in the presence of Coulomb\ninteractions, the {\\em macroscopic} phase separation gets suppressed, and\ninstead nanometer scale regions of polarons interspersed with band electron\npuddles appear, constituting a new kind of quantum Coulomb glass. Our work\npoints to an interplay of strong correlations, long range Coulomb interaction\nand dopant ion disorder as the origin of nanoscale inhomogeneities, rather than\ndisorder frustrated phase competition as is generally believed. Based on this,\nwe argue that the observed micrometer(meso)-scale inhomogeneities owe their\nexistence to extrinsic causes, eg. strain due to cracks and defects.

The\nobservation that the fraction of radio-loud quasars decreases with increasing\nredshift is inconsistent with the popular notion that BH spin is a critical\nfactor for generating strong radio jets.

The positional center of the gamma-ray\nsource is only ~3' away from the NGC 1275 nucleus, well within the 95% LAT\nerror circle of ~5'.The spatial distribution of gamma-ray photons is consistent\nwith a point source. The average flux and power-law photon index measured with\nthe LAT from 2008 August 4 to 2008 December 5 are F_gamma = (2.10+-0.23)x\n10^{-7} ph (>100 MeV) cm^{-2} s^{-1} and Gamma = 2.17+-0.05, respectively. The\nmeasurements are statistically consistent with constant flux during the\nfour-month LAT observing period.Previous EGRET observations gave an upper limit\nof F_gamma < 3.72x 10 ^{-8} ph (>100 MeV) cm^{-2} s^{-1} to the gamma-ray flux\nfrom NGC 1275. This indicates that the source is variable on timescales of\nyears to decades, and therefore restricts the fraction of emission that can be\nproduced in extended regions of the galaxy cluster. Contemporaneous and\nhistorical radio observations are also reported. The broadband spectrum of NGC\n1275 is modeled with a simple one-zone synchrotron/synchrotron self-Compton\nmodel and a model with a decelerating jet flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2009 04:44:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-27"}

The formalism is valid for arbitrary orbital eccentricities\nand therefore applicable to white dwarf binaries in the Galactic disk as well\nas globular clusters. In the quasi-static limit, the total perturbation of the\ngravitational potential shows a phase shift with respect to the position of the\ncompanion, the magnitude of which is determined primarily by the efficiency of\nenergy dissipation through convective damping. We determine rates of secular\nevolution of the orbital elements and white dwarf rotational angular velocity\nfor a 0.3 solar mass helium white dwarf in binaries with orbital frequencies in\nthe LISA gravitational wave frequency band and companion masses ranging from\n0.3 to 10^5 solar masses. The resulting tidal evolution time scales for the\norbital semi-major axis are longer than a Hubble time, so that convective\ndamping of quasi-static tides need not be considered in the construction of\ngravitational wave templates of white dwarf binaries in the LISA band. Spin-up\nof the white dwarf, on the other hand, can occur on time scales of less than\n10Myr, provided that the white dwarf is initially rotating with a frequency\nmuch smaller than the orbital frequency. For semi-detached white dwarf binaries\nspin-up can occur on time scales of less than 1Myr. Nevertheless, the time\nscales remain longer than the orbital inspiral time scales due to gravitational\nradiation, so that the degree of asynchronism in these binaries increases. As a\nconsequence, tidal forcing eventually occurs at forcing frequencies beyond the\nquasi-static tide approximation. For the shortest period binaries, energy\ndissipation is therefore expected to take place through dynamic tides and\nresonantly excited g-modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2009 14:59:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}
