Such low mass scales can arise when\nhidden sectors are more weakly coupled to supersymmetry breaking than the\nvisible sector, as happens when supersymmetry breaking is communicated to the\nvisible sector by gauge interactions under which the hidden sector is\nuncharged, or if the hidden sector is sequestered from gravity-mediated\nsupersymmetry breaking. We study these mechanisms in detail in the context of\ngauge and gaugino mediation, and present specific models of Abelian GeV-scale\nhidden sectors. In particular, we discuss kinetic mixing of a U(1)_x gauge\nforce with hypercharge, singlets or bi-fundamentals which couple to both\nsectors, and additional loop effects. Finally, we investigate the possible\nrelevance of such sectors for dark matter phenomenology, as well as for low-\nand high-energy collider searches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Apr 2009 17:53:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2009 01:15:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-15"}

Our model is\na substantially modified version of the one by Springel et al. (2005). Because\ncosmological simulations lack both the resolution and the physics to model the\nmultiphase interstellar medium, they tend to strongly underestimate the\nBondi-Hoyle accretion rate. To allow low-mass BHs to grow, it is therefore\nnecessary to increase the predicted Bondi-Hoyle rates in dense gas by large,\nad-hoc factors. We explore the physical regimes where the use of such factors\nis reasonable, and through this introduce a new prescription for gas accretion.\nFeedback from AGN is modeled by coupling a fraction of the rest-mass energy of\nthe accreted gas thermally into the surrounding medium. We describe the\nimplementation as well as the limitations of the model and motivate all the\nchanges relative to previous work.\n  We investigate the robustness of the predictions for the cosmic star\nformation history, the redshift zero cosmic BH density, BH scaling relations,\nand galaxy specific star formation rates. We find that the freedom introduced\nby the need to increase the predicted accretion rates, the standard procedure\nin the literature, is the most significant source of uncertainty. Our\nsimulations demonstrate that supermassive BHs are able to regulate their growth\nby releasing a fixed amount of energy for a given halo mass, independent of the\nassumed efficiency of AGN feedback, which sets the normalization of the BH\nscaling relations. Regardless of whether BH seeds are initially placed above or\nbelow the BH scaling relations they grow onto the same relations. AGN feedback\nefficiently suppresses star formation in high-mass galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Apr 2009 16:39:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 May 2009 08:07:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

We turn this lower\nbound into an upper bound, by giving a quantum walk algorithm based on the dual\nSDP that has query complexity at most the general adversary bound, up to a\nlogarithmic factor.\n  In more detail, the proof has two steps, each based on \"span programs,\" a\ncertain linear-algebraic model of computation. First, we give an SDP that\noutputs for any boolean function a span program computing it that has optimal\n\"witness size.\" The optimal witness size is shown to coincide with the general\nadversary lower bound. Second, we give a quantum algorithm for evaluating span\nprograms with only a logarithmic query overhead on the witness size.\n  The first result is motivated by a quantum algorithm for evaluating composed\nspan programs. The algorithm is known to be optimal for evaluating a large\nclass of formulas. The allowed gates include all constant-size functions for\nwhich there is an optimal span program. So far, good span programs have been\nfound in an ad hoc manner, and the SDP automates this procedure. Surprisingly,\nthe SDP's value equals the general adversary bound. A corollary is an optimal\nquantum algorithm for evaluating \"balanced\" formulas over any finite boolean\ngate set. The second result extends span programs' applicability beyond the\nformula evaluation problem.\n  A strong universality result for span programs follows. A good quantum query\nalgorithm for a problem implies a good span program, and vice versa. Although\nnearly tight, this equivalence is nontrivial.

In\nparticular, we calculate the dependence of maximum black hole mass on\nmetallicity and on some specific wind mass loss rates (e.g., Hurley et al. and\nVink et al.). Our calculations show that the highest mass black holes observed\nin the Galaxy M_bh = 15 Msun in the high metallicity environment (Z=Zsun=0.02)\ncan be explained with stellar models and the wind mass loss rates adopted here.\nTo reach this result we had to set Luminous Blue Variable mass loss rates at\nthe level of about 0.0001 Msun/yr and to employ metallicity dependent\nWolf-Rayet winds. With such winds, calibrated on Galactic black hole mass\nmeasurements, the maximum black hole mass obtained for moderate metallicity\n(Z=0.3 Zsun=0.006) is M_bh,max = 30 Msun. This is a rather striking finding as\nthe mass of the most massive known stellar black hole is M_bh = 23-34 Msun and,\nin fact, it is located in a small star forming galaxy with moderate\nmetallicity. We find that in the very low (globular cluster-like) metallicity\nenvironment the maximum black hole mass can be as high as M_bh,max = 80 Msun\n(Z=0.01 Zsun=0.0002). It is interesting to note that X-ray luminosity from\nEddington limited accretion onto an 80 Msun black hole is of the order of about\n10^40 erg/s and is comparable to luminosities of some known ULXs.

In\ngeneral, the radiation intensity emitted by the photo-oval is non-uniform, and\nthe photo-oval surface has a relative velocity with respect to the position of\nthe comoving observer. Both effects introduce some degree of anisotropy in the\nradiation field observed in the comoving frame. As a result, the radiation\nfield observed by the comoving observer becomes {\\it anisotropic}, and the\nEddington factor must deviate from the usual value of 1/3. Thus, the\nrelativistic Eddington factor generally depends on the optical depth $\\tau$ and\nthe velocity gradient $du/d\\tau$, $u$ being the four velocity. % In the case of\na plane-parallel vertical flow, we obtain the shape of the photo-oval and\ncalculate the Eddington factor in the optically thick regime. We found that the\nEddington factor $f$ is well approximated by $f(\\tau, \\frac{du}{d\\tau}) = {1/3}\n\\exp (\\frac{1}{u} \\frac{du}{d\\tau}) $. % This relativistic variable Eddington\nfactor can be used in various relativistic radiatively-driven flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Apr 2009 00:39:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

As the shocked secondary wind is responsible for most of the\nX-ray emission, the accretion process accounts for the X-ray minimum. The early\nexit from the 2009 X-ray minimum after four weeks, instead of ten weeks as in\nthe two previous minima, is attributed to the primary wind that during the last\nminimum was somewhat faster and of lower mass loss rate than during the two\nprevious X-ray minima. This results in a much lower mass accretion rate during\nthe X-ray minimum. We show that using fluctuations in these quantities that are\nwithin the range deduced from fluctuations in the X-ray flux outside the\nminimum, can account for the short duration of the last X-ray minimum.

At intermediate densities, we detect significant\ndifferences, indicating that close pairs could have experienced a more rapid\ntransition onto the red sequence than isolated galaxies. The presence of a\ncorrelation between colours and morphologies indicates that the physical\nmechanism responsible for the colour transformation also operates changing\ngalaxy morphologies. Regardless of dark matter halo mass, we show that the\npercentage of red galaxies in close pairs and in the control sample are\ncomparable at low and high local density environments. However, at intermediate\nlocal densities, the gap in the red fraction between close pairs and the\ncontrol galaxies increases from ~10% in low mass haloes up to ~50% in the most\nmassive ones. Our findings suggest that in intermediate density environments\ngalaxies are efficiently pre-processed by close encounters and mergers before\nentering higher local density regions.

The presence of direct higher-twist processes,\nwhere a proton is produced directly in the hard subprocess, can explain the\n\"baryon anomaly\" -- the large proton-to-pion ratio seen at RHIC in high\ncentrality heavy ion collisions. Direct hadronic processes can also account for\nthe deviation from leading-twist PQCD scaling at fixed x_T = 2p_T/\\sqrt s. I\nsuggest that the \"ridge\" -- the same-side long-range rapidity correlation\nobserved at RHIC in high centrality heavy ion collisions is due to the imprint\nof semihard DGLAP gluon radiation from initial-state partons which have\ntransverse momenta biased toward the trigger. Rescattering interactions from\ngluon-exchange, normally neglected in the parton model, have a profound effect\nin QCD hard-scattering reactions, leading to leading-twist single-spin\nasymmetries, diffractive deep inelastic scattering, diffractive hard hadronic\nreactions, the breakdown of the Lam-Tung relation in Drell-Yan reactions,\nnuclear shadowing --all leading-twist dynamics not incorporated in the\nlight-front wavefunctions of the target computed in isolation. Antishadowing is\nshown to be quark flavor specific and thus different in charged and neutral\ndeep inelastic lepton-nucleus scattering. I also discuss the consequences of\ncolor-octet intrinsic heavy quark distributions in the proton for heavy\nparticle and Higgs production at high x_F.
