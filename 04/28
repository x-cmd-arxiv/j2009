These new\nmeasurements significantly improve the constraints on anisotropy power at 150\nGHz over the range of angular multipoles 3000 < l < 10,000, limiting the total\nastronomical signal in a flat band power to be less than 105 microK^2 at 95%\nCL.

This\ntask is impossible to realize when it relies solely on the asynchronous\nexchange of classical bits: one dishonest player has complete control over the\nfinal outcome. It is only when coin flipping is supplemented with quantum\ncommunication that this problem can be alleviated, although partial bias\nremains. Unfortunately, practical systems are subject to loss of quantum data,\nwhich restores complete or nearly complete bias in previous protocols. We\nreport herein on the first implementation of a quantum coin-flipping protocol\nthat is impervious to loss. Moreover, in the presence of unavoidable\nexperimental noise, we propose to use this protocol sequentially to implement\nmany coin flips, which guarantees that a cheater unwillingly reveals\nasymptotically, through an increased error rate, how many outcomes have been\nfixed. Hence, we demonstrate for the first time the possibility of flipping\ncoins in a realistic setting. Flipping quantum coins thereby joins quantum key\ndistribution as one of the few currently practical applications of quantum\ncommunication.

We search for stable, self-consistent N-body orbits with the so\ncalled GAMP method that incorporates stability constraints into the\noptimization algorithm. Our searches reveal only small regions of stable\nmotions in the phase space of three-planet, coplanar configurations.

In\nformer theoretical work, we showed that a quantum algorithm requires the number\nof function evaluations of a classical algorithm that knows in advance 50% of\nthe information that specifies the solution of the problem. Here we check that\nthis 50% rule holds for the main quantum algorithms.

We observed two distinct types of diffuse scattering. The first is\nweak, relatively temperature independent, persists to at least 900 K, and forms\nbow-tie-shaped patterns in reciprocal space centered on (h00) Bragg peaks. We\nassociate this primarily with chemical short-range order. The second is strong,\ntemperature dependent, and forms butterfly-shaped patterns centered on (h00)\nBragg peaks. This diffuse scattering has been attributed to the PNR because it\nresponds to an electric field and vanishes near Td ~ 620K when measured with\nthermal neutrons. Surprisingly, it vanishes at 420K when measured with cold\nneutrons, which provide ~4 times superior energy resolution. That this onset\ntemperature depends on the instrumental energy resolution demands a\nreassessment of the Burns temperature Td. Neutron backscattering measurements\nmade with 300 times better energy resolution confirm the onset temperature of\n420+/-20K. The energy width of the diffuse scattering is resolution limited,\nindicating that the PNR are static on timescales of at least 2 nsec. Transverse\nacoustic (TA) phonon lifetimes are temperature independent up to 900K for q <\n0.2 1/A. This motivates a physical picture in which sufficiently\nlong-wavelength TA phonons average over the PNR; only those TA phonons having\nwavelengths comparable to the size of the PNR are affected. The PMN lattice\nconstant changes by less than 0.001 Angstroms below 300K, but expands rapidly\nat a rate of 2.5x10^-5 1/K at high temperature. The regimes of low and high\nthermal expansion bracket the revised value of Td, which suggests the anomalous\nthermal expansion results from the condensation of static PNR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2009 18:32:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-11"}

The data reveal\nthat there is only one transition observed over the entire range of variables\nexplored, which is a combined magnetic and structural transformation between\nthe paramagnetic to ferromagnetic phases (Tc~255 K for this composition). The\nstructural part of the transition is associated with an expansion of the\nhexagonal unit cell in the direction of the a- and b-axes and a contraction of\nthe c-axis as the FM phase is formed, which originates from an increase in the\nintra-layer metal-metal bond distance. The application of pressure is found to\nhave an adverse effect on the formation of the FM phase since pressure opposes\nthe expansion of the lattice and hence decreases Tc. The application of a\nmagnetic field, on the other hand, has the expected effect of enhancing the FM\nphase and increasing Tc. We find that the substantial range of\ntemperature/field/pressure coexistence of the PM and FM phases observed is due\nto compositional variations in the sample.

The Spitzer Space Telescope has detected a powerful (L(H2)~10^41 erg\ns-1) mid-infrared H2 emission towards the galaxy-wide collision in the\nStephan's Quintet (SQ) galaxy group. This discovery was followed by the\ndetection of more distant H2-luminous extragalactic sources, with almost no\nspectroscopic signatures of star formation. These observations set molecular\ngas in a new context where one has to describe its role as a cooling agent of\nenergetic phases of galaxy evolution. Aims. The SQ postshock medium is observed\nto be multiphase, with H2 gas coexisting with a hot (~ 5 10^6 K), X-ray\nemitting plasma. The surface brightness of H2 lines exceeds that of the X-rays\nand the 0-0 S(1) H2 linewidth is ~ 900 km s-1, of the same order of the\ncollision velocity. These observations raise three questions we propose to\nanswer: (i) Why H2 is present in the postshock gas ? (ii) How can we account\nfor the H2 excitation ? (iii) Why H2 is a dominant coolant ? Methods. We\nconsider the collision of two flows of multiphase dusty gas. Our model\nquantifies the gas cooling, dust destruction, H2 formation and excitation in\nthe postshock medium. Results. (i) The shock velocity, the post-shock\ntemperature and the gas cooling timescale depend on the preshock gas density.\nThe collision velocity is the shock velocity in the low density volume filling\nintercloud gas. This produces a ~ 5 10^6 K, dust-free, X-ray emitting plasma.\nThe shock velocity is smaller in clouds. We show that gas heated to\ntemperatures less than 10^6 K cools, keeps its dust content and becomes H2\nwithin the SQ collision age (~ 5 10^6 years). (ii) Since the bulk kinetic\nenergy of the H2 gas is the dominant energy reservoir, we consider that the H2\nemission is powered by the dissipation of kinetic turbulent energy.

Self-gravitating gas is also\nintuitively associated with star formation. However, recent simulations of the\ninfall process display highly turbulent continuous flows. We propose that\nJ-transfer, which enables the inflow, also suppresses fragmentation.\nInefficient J loss by the gas leads to decay of turbulence, triggering global\ninstabilities and renewed turbulence driving. Flow regulated in this way is\nstable against fragmentation, whilst staying close to the instability threshold\nfor bar formation -- thick self-gravitating disks are prone to global\ninstabilities before they become unstable locally. On smaller scales, the\nfraction of gravitationally unstable matter swept up by shocks in such a flow\nis a small and decreasing function of the Mach number. We conclude\ncounterintuitively that gas able to cool down to a small fraction of its virial\ntemperature will not fragment as it collapses. This provides a venue for\nsupermassive black holes to form via direct infall, without the intermediary\nstage of forming a star cluster. Some black holes could have formed or grown in\nmassive halos at low redshifts. Thus the fragmentation is intimately related to\nJ redistribution within the system: it is less dependent on the molecular and\nmetal cooling but is conditioned by the ability of the flow to develop virial,\nsupersonic turbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2009 20:00:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 2009 20:28:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

We find that the presence of a close companion\nraises the star formation rate by a factor of just under two, while increasing\nhardly at all the equivalent width of the H alpha emission. This means that\nalthough statistically galaxies with close companions form stars at a higher\nrate, they do this over extended periods of time, and not as bursts. We find no\nsignificant increase in the central concentration of the star formation as a\nresult of the presence of a close companion. The fraction of truly interacting\nor merging galaxies is very small in the local Universe, at around 2%, and\npossibly 4% of bright galaxies. Most of these interacting galaxies currently\nhave unremarkable star formation properties. We also study the properties of\nthe Survey galaxies with the most extreme values for star formation indicators\nsuch as rate, equivalent width, star formation rate per area, and gas depletion\ntimescale. We find that each of these indicators favors a different subset of\ngalaxies, and use this information to discuss critically the possible\ndefinitions of the term starburst to describe galaxies with enhanced star\nformation activity. We conclude that no one starburst definition can be devised\nwhich is objective and generally discriminant. Unless one restricts the use of\nthe term \"starburst\" to a very small number of galaxies, the term will continue\nto be used for a heterogeneous and wide-ranging collection of objects with no\nphysical basis for their classification as starburst.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2009 20:23:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-25"}

Such behavior is known from spin glasses and\nfrustrated systems. Rb4O6 and Cs4O6 comprise two different types of dioxygen\nanions, the hyperoxide and the peroxide anions.

What\nis the lowest possible distortion in a causal estimate at the supervisor ? Is\nDelta sampling better than periodic sampling ? We answer these questions under\nan idealized model of the network and the assumption of perfect measurements at\nthe sensor. For a scalar, linear diffusion process, we study the problem of\nchoosing the causal sampling times that will give the lowest aggregate squared\nerror distortion. We stick to finite-horizons and impose a hard upper bound on\nthe number of allowed samples. We cast the design as a problem of choosing an\noptimal sequence of stopping times. We reduce this to a nested sequence of\nproblems each asking for a single optimal stopping time. Under an unproven but\nnatural assumption about the least-square estimate at the supervisor, each of\nthese single stopping problems are of standard form. The optimal stopping times\nare random times when the estimation error exceeds designed envelopes. For the\ncase where the state is a Brownian motion, we give analytically: the shape of\nthe optimal sampling envelopes, the shape of the envelopes under optimal Delta\nsampling, and their performances. Surprisingly, we find that Delta sampling\nperforms badly. Hence, when the rate constraint is a hard limit on the number\nof samples over a finite horizon, we should should not use Delta sampling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2009 10:08:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2011 10:58:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-21"}

The on-surface diffusion path energetics of atomic hydrogen, as\nwell as the activation barriers for hydrogen penetration from the on-surface to\nthe subsurface sites, are also presented at low coverage. At high coverage of\n$1.00<\\Theta<2.0, it is found that the coadsorption configuration with 1.0\nmonolayer of H's residing on the surface fcc sites and the remaining monolayer\nof H's occupying the subsurface tetra-I sites is most energetically favourable.\nThe resultant H-Mg-H sandwich structure for this most stable coadsorption\nconfiguration displays similar spectral features to the bulk hydride MgH$_{2}$\nin the density of states. The other properties of the H/Mg(0001) system,\nincluding the charge distribution, the lattice relaxation, the work function,\nand the electronic density of states, are also studied and discussed in detail.\nIt is pointed out that the H-Mg chemical bonding during surface hydrogenation\ndisplays a mixed ionic/covalent character.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2009 13:06:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-29"}

We find no evidence of GWs associated with any SGR\nburst in a sample consisting of the 2004 December 27 giant flare from SGR\n1806-20 and 190 lesser events from SGR 1806-20 and SGR 1900+14 which occurred\nduring the first year of LIGO's fifth science run. GW strain upper limits and\nmodel-dependent GW emission energy upper limits are estimated for individual\nbursts using a variety of simulated waveforms. We find upper limit estimates on\nthe model-dependent isotropic GW emission energies (at a nominal distance of 10\nkpc) between 3x10^45 and 9x10^52 erg depending on waveform type, detector\nantenna factors and noise characteristics at the time of the burst.

We analyze winds\nwith polar magnetic field intensities ranging from 1 to 20G. We show that the\nwind structure presents characteristics that are similar to the solar coronal\nwind. The steady-state magnetic field topology for all cases is similar,\npresenting a configuration of helmet streamer-type, with zones of closed field\nlines and open field lines coexisting.

A simplified MHD model for the global coronal magnetic\nfield evolution in response to flux emergence and shearing by large-scale\nsurface motions is described and motivated. Using automated algorithms for\ndetecting flux ropes and ejections in the global magnetic model, the effects of\nkey simulation parameters on the formation of flux ropes and the number of\nejections are considered, over a 177-day period in 1999. These key parameters\ninclude the magnitude and sign of magnetic helicity emerging in active regions,\nand coronal diffusion. The number of flux ropes found in the simulation at any\none time fluctuates between about 28 and 48, sustained by the emergence of new\nbipolar regions, but with no systematic dependence on the helicity of these\nregions. However, the emerging helicity does affect the rate of flux rope\nejections, which doubles from 0.67 per day if the bipoles emerge untwisted to\n1.28 per day in the run with greatest emerging twist. The number of ejections\nin the simulation is also increased by 20%-30% by choosing the majority sign of\nemerging bipole helicity in each hemisphere, or by halving the turbulent\ndiffusivity in the corona. For reasonable parameter choices, the model produces\napproximately 50% of the observed CME rate.

Some\ntemporal characteristics are similar to those in the Rapid Burster and GRO\nJ1744-28, making XSS J12270-4859 a very rare object.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2009 15:28:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

However,\nmeasurement of the linear resistance of these nanowires have been inconclusive\nin determining the low-temperature behavior of phase-slip fluctuations, both\nquantal and thermal. Thus, we are motivated to study the nonlinear\ncurrent-voltage characteristics in current-biased nanowires and the stochastic\ndynamics of superconductive-resistive switching, as a way of probing phase-slip\nevents. In particular, we address the question: Can a single phase-slip event\noccurring somewhere along the wire--during which the order-parameter fluctuates\nto zero--induce switching, via the local heating it causes? We explore this and\nrelated issues by constructing a stochastic model for the time-evolution of the\ntemperature in a nanowire whose ends are maintained at a fixed temperature. We\nderive the corresponding master equation as tool for evaluating and analyzing\nthe mean switching time at a given value of current. The model indicates that\nalthough, in general, several phase-slip events are necessary to induce\nswitching via a thermal runaway, there is indeed a regime of temperatures and\ncurrents in which a single event is sufficient. We carry out a detailed\ncomparison of the results of the model with experimental measurements of the\ndistribution of switching currents, and provide an explanation for the\ncounter-intuitive broadening of the distribution width that is observed upon\nlowering the temperature. Moreover, we identify a regime in which the\nexperiments are probing individual phase-slip events, and thus offer a way for\nexploring the physics of nanoscale quantum tunneling of the superconducting\norder parameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2009 15:53:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-17"}
