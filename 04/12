In general, flows change the waves' phase velocities\ncompared to their magnitudes in a static MHD plasma slab and the Hall effect\nlimits the range of waves' propagation. On the other hand, when the relative\nAlfvenic Mach number is negative, the flow extends the waves propagation range\nbeyond that limit (owing to the Hall effect) and can cause the triggering of\nthe Kelvin--Helmholtz instability whose onset begins at specific critical wave\nnumbers.

Combining our method\nwith available observational data of proper motions, we derive the intrinsic\nvelocity as well as the viewing angles to the line of sight for eight knotty\nregions down the M87 jet. The results favor the 'modest beaming' scenario along\nthe jet, with Doppler factors varying between 2-5. The inner jet of M87 suffers\nsharp deceleration, and the intrinsic speed remains roughly constant down the\nouter jet. The orientation of the inner jet regions is fully consistent with\nthe result of 10deg-19deg to the line of sight suggested by previous Hubble\nSpace Telescope (HST) proper motion studies of the M87 jet. The outer jet,\nhowever, shows systematic deflection off the inner jet to much smaller\ninclination (<<10deg). Further calculation of knot A suggests this deflection\ncan be regarded as evidence that the outer jet suffers some departure from\nequipartition. The nucleus region of the M87 jet should have a viewing angle\nclose to its first knot HST-1, i.e. ~15deg, which favors the idea that M87 may\nbe a misaligned blazar.

In the absence of the magnetic field, the quantum interference effect in\nthe electric conductivity from the contribution of Cooperon propagator will be\nstudied and possible weak localization in the system is discussed in terms of\nthe sample length and temperature. The magnetoconductivity stemming from the\nquantum interference effect is calculated, and the obtained results are in good\nagreement with experimental measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Apr 2009 14:28:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-23"}
