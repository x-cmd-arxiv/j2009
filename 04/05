We demonstrate that\ncommensurability of the nanotube walls can increase the dissipation rate, while\nthe structure of the wall ends and the nanotube length do not influence the\nQ-factor.

This\nmodel uses a streamline formalism to calculate the ring's internal forces,\nnamely, ring gravity, pressure, viscosity, as well as a hypothetical drag\nforce. The model calculates the streamlines' forced orbit elements and surface\ndensity throughout the perturbed ring. The model is then applied to the outer\nedge of Saturn's B ring, which is maintained by an m=2 inner LR with the\nsatellite Mimas. Ring models are used to illustrate how a ring's perturbed\nstate depends on the ring's physical properties: surface density, viscosity,\ndispersion velocity, and the hypothetical drag force. A comparison of models to\nthe observed outer B ring suggests that the ring's surface density there is\nbetween 10 and 280 gm/cm^2. The ring's edge also indicates where the viscous\ntorque counterbalances the perturbing satellite's gravitational torque on the\nring. But an examination of seemingly conventional viscous B ring models shows\nthat they all fail to balance these torques at the ring's edge. This is due\nring self-gravity and the fact that a viscous ring tends to be nearly\nperi-aligned with the satellite, which reduces the satellite's torque on the\nring and makes the ring's edge more difficult to maintain. Nonetheless, the\nfollowing shows that a torque balance can still be achieved in a viscous B\nring, but only in an extreme case where the ratio of the ring's bulk/shear\nviscosities satisfy ~10^4. However, if the dissipation of the ring's forced\nmotions is instead dominated by a weak drag force, then the satellite can exert\na much stronger torque that can counterbalance the ring's viscous torque.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Apr 2009 22:32:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

Both slow MC1 and fast MC2 are initially emerged\nalong the heliospheric equator, one after another with different time interval.\nThe coupling of two MCs could be considered as the comprehensive interaction\nbetween two systems, each comprising of an MC body and its driven shock. The\nMC2-driven shock and MC2 body are successively involved into interaction with\nMC1 body. The momentum is transferred from MC2 to MC1. After the passage of\nMC2-driven shock front, magnetic field lines in MC1 medium previously\ncompressed by MC2-driven shock are prevented from being restored by the MC2\nbody pushing. MC1 body undergoes the most violent compression from the ambient\nsolar wind ahead, continuous penetration of MC2-driven shock through MC1 body,\nand persistent pushing of MC2 body at MC1 tail boundary. As the evolution\nproceeds, the MC1 body suffers from larger and larger compression, and its\noriginal vulnerable magnetic elasticity becomes stiffer and stiffer.

Similar to social norms or conventions, it is an emergent feature\nresulting from the firms' interaction in an economic network. To model these\ndynamics, we consider a distributed agent population, representing e.g. firms\nor individuals. Further, we build on a continuous opinion dynamics model with\nbounded confidence ($\\epsilon$), which assumes that two agents only interact if\ndifferences in their behaviour are less than $\\epsilon$. Interaction results in\nmore similarity of behaviour, i.e. convergence towards a common mean. This\nframework is extended by two major concepts: (i) The agent's in-group\nconsisting of acquainted interaction partners is explicitly taken into account.\nThis leads to an effective agent behaviour reflecting that agents try to\ncontinue to interact with past partners and thus to keep sufficiently close to\nthem. (ii) The in-group network structure changes over time, as agents can form\nnew links to other agents with sufficiently close effective behaviour or delete\nlinks to agents no longer close in behaviour. Thus, our model provides a\nfeedback mechanism between the agents' behaviour and their in-group structure.\nStudying its consequences by means of agent-based computer simulations, we find\nthat for narrow-minded agents (low $\\epsilon$) the additional feedback helps to\nfind consensus more often, whereas for open-minded agents (high $\\epsilon$)\nthis does not hold. This counterintuitive result is explained by simulations of\nthe network evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Apr 2009 11:52:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-07"}

The MC is\ninjected with very strong inherent magnetic field over that in the ambient flow\nand expands rapidly in size initially. Consequently, the diameter of MC\nincreases in an asymptotic speed while its angular width contracts gradually.\nMeanwhile, simulations of MC-shock interaction are also presented, in which\nboth a typical MC and a strong fast shock emerge from the inner boundary and\npropagate along heliospheric equator, separated by an appropriate interval.
