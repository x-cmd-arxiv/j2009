Given a generic component of\nthe moment map, we define a canonical class \\alpha_p in the equivariant\ncohomology of the manifold M for each fixed point p of M. When they exist,\ncanonical classes form a natural basis of the equivariant cohomology of M; in\nparticular, when M is a flag variety, these classes are the equivariant\nSchubert classes. We show that the restriction of a canonical class \\alpha_p to\na fixed point q can be calculated by a rational function which depends only on\nthe value of the moment map, and the restriction of other canonical classes to\npoints of index exactly two higher.

In this\npaper, the complexifier is chosen for the first time to involve squares of area\noperators.\n  Both cases use coherent states that depend on a graph. However, the basic\ndifference between the two choices of complexifier is that in the first case\nthe set of surfaces involved is discrete, while, in the second it is\ncontinuous. This raises the important question of whether the second set of\nstates has improved invariance properties with respect to relative orientation\nof the chosen graph in the set of surfaces on which the complexifier depends.\nIn this paper, we examine this question in detail, including a semiclassical\nanalysis.\n  The main result is that we obtain the correct semiclassical properties of the\nvolume operator for i) artificial rescaling of the coherent state label; and\nii) particular orientations of the 4- and 6-valent graphs that have measure\nzero in the group SO(3). Since such requirements are not present when analysing\ndual cell complex states, we conclude that coherent states whose complexifiers\nare squares of area operators are not an appropriate tool with which to analyse\nthe semiclassical properties of the volume operator.

The first part deals with\npion-nucleon/meson-baryon scattering in the Kadyshevsky formalism. This\nformalism is introduced and discussed. Problems may arise when derivative\ncouplings and/or higher spin fields are used, especially when compared to the\nresults in the Feynman formalism: unwanted contact terms pop-up. These terms\nare cancelled using the Gross and Jackiw or Takahashi and Umezawa method. The\nfinal results in both formalisms are therefore equal, causal and covariant.\nFormal incorporation of pair suppression in the baryon exchange sector is\nachieved using a method based on the Takahashi and Umezawa method. For the\nresulting tree level amplitudes, we have shown, to our knowledge for the first\ntime, that they are causal, covariant and n-independent. Moreover, the\namplitudes are just a factor 1/2 of the usual Feynman expressions. The\namplitudes contain only posititve energy initial and final states, although it\nshould be mentioned that negative energy is present inside an amplitude via the\nDelta propagator. The second part of this thesis deals with higher spin field\nquantization in the framework of Dirac's Constraint analysis. A full constraint\nanalysis and quantization procedure is presented for the free spin 1,3/2 and 2\ncase and for the situation where these fields are coupled to auxiliary fields.\nThe constructed propagators in the former case are shown to be non-covariant,\nas is well-known. Therefore, auxiliary fields coupled to gauge conditions of\nthe free case are introduced in the Lagrangian.

Luminous blazars have also typically very hard X-ray\nspectra, and those in turn seem to challenge hadronic scenarios for the high\nenergy blazar emission. As shown in this paper, no such problems are faced by\nthe models which involve Comptonization of radiation provided by a broad\nline-region, or dusty molecular torus. The lack or weakness of bulk Compton and\nKlein-Nishina features indicated by the presently available data favors\nproduction of gamma-rays via up-scattering of infrared photons from hot dust.\nThis implies that the blazar emission zone is located at parsec-scale distances\nfrom the nucleus, and as such is possibly associated with the extended,\nquasi-stationary reconfinement shocks formed in relativistic outflows. This\nscenario predicts characteristic timescales for flux changes in luminous\nblazars to be days/weeks, consistent with the variability patterns observed in\nsuch systems at infrared, optical and gamma-ray frequencies. We also propose\nthat the parsec-scale blazar activity can be occasionally accompanied by\ndissipative events taking place at sub-parsec distances and powered by internal\nshocks and/or reconnection of magnetic fields.

Asset backed securities have been\nextensively criticised for creating a moral hazard in loan issuance and an\nassociated increase in default risk, by removing the immediate lender's\nincentive to ensure that the underlying loans could be repaid. However\nsignificant monetary issues can accompany any form of increased commercial bank\nlending, and these appear to have been overlooked by this analysis. In this\npaper we propose a general explanation for credit crises based on an\nexamination of the mechanics of the banking system, and in particular its\ninternal controls on the supply of credit. We suggest that the current credit\ncrisis is the result of multiple failures in the Basel regulatory framework,\nincluding the removal of central bank reserve requirements from some classes of\ndeposit accounts within the banking system, allowing financial instruments\nrepresenting debt to be used as regulatory capital, and in particular the\nintroduction of securitized lending which effectively removed a previously\nimplicit control over the total quantity of lending originating from the\nbanking system. We further argue that the interaction of these problems has led\nto a destabilising imbalance between total money and loan supply growth, in\nthat total lending sourced from the commercial bank sector increased at a\nfaster rate than accompanying growth in the money supply. This not only created\na multi-decade macro-economic debt spiral, but by increasing the ratio of debt\nto money within the monetary system acted to increase the risk of loan\ndefaults, and consequentially reduce the overall stability of the banking\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Apr 2009 20:30:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Dec 2009 16:50:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 9 Jan 2011 23:41:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 3 Aug 2012 00:31:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-06"}

These features have\nbeen recently ascribed to the relaxation of residual stresses in the film that\nstem from the nonequilibrium preparation of the samples. Recent experiments by\nCoppee et al. on PS with low molecular weight, where such stresses could not be\nevidenced, showed however similar behavior. By scaling arguments and numerical\nsolution of a thin film viscoelastic model we show that the maximum in the\nwidth of the rim can be caused by a temporal evolution of the friction\ncoefficient (or equivalently of the slip length), for which we discuss two\npossible mechanisms. In addition, the maximum in the width is affected by the\nsample age. As a consequence, knowing the temporal behavior of friction (or\nslip length) in principle allows to measure the aging dynamics of a\npolymer-polymer interface by simple dewetting experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Apr 2009 09:27:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The layers are\nsp2 hybridized honeycomb networks with strong in plane sigma and weaker pi\nbonds to the substrate and to the adsorbates. This hierarchy in bond strength\ncauses anisotropic elastic properties, where the sp2 layers are stiff in plane\nand soft out of plane. A corrugation of these layers imposes a third hierarchy\nlevel in bond energies, with lateral bonding to molecular objects with sizes\nbetween 1 and 5 nanometer. This extra bond energies are in the range of thermal\nenergies kT at room temperature and are particularly interesting for\nnanotechnology. The concomitant template function will be discussed.

S-K mappings are\ncontinuous, or piecewise continuous direct source-to-channel mappings operating\ndirectly on amplitude continuous and discrete time signals. Such mappings\ninclude several existing JSCC schemes as special cases. Many existing\napproaches to analog- or hybrid discrete analog JSCC provide both excellent\nperformance as well as robustness to variations in noise level. This at low\ndelay and relatively low complexity. However, a theory explaining their\nperformance and behaviour on a general basis, as well as guidelines on how to\nconstruct close to optimal mappings in general, does not currently exist.\nTherefore, such mappings are often found based on educated guesses inspired of\nconfigurations that are known in advance to produce good solutions, combination\nof already existing mappings, numerical optimization or machine learning\nmethods. The objective of this paper is to introduce a theoretical framework\nfor analysis of analog- or hybrid discrete analog S-K mappings. This framework\nwill enable calculation of distortion when applying such schemes on\npoint-to-point links, reveal more about their fundamental nature, and provide\nguidelines on how they should be constructed in order to perform well at both\nlow and arbitrary complexity and delay. Such guidelines will likely help\nconstrain solutions to numerical approaches and help explain why machine\nlearning approaches finds the solutions they do. This task is difficult and we\ndo not provide a complete framework at this stage: We focus on high SNR and\nmemoryless sources with an arbitrary continuous unimodal density function and\nmemoryless Gaussian channels.

All measurements were carried out on individual quantum dots\nstudied by micro-photoluminescence at low temperature. We show that the\nhyperfine interaction leads to an effective partial spin relaxation, under\n50kHz modulated excitation polarization, which becomes however strongly\ninhibited under steady optical pumping conditions because of dynamical nuclear\npolarization. This optically created magnetic-like nuclear field can become\nvery strong (up to ~4 T) when it is generated in the direction opposite to a\nlongitudinally applied field, and exhibits then a bistability regime. This\neffect is very well described by a theoretical model derived in a perturbative\napproach, which reveals the key role played by the energy cost of an electron\nspin flip in the total magnetic field. Eventually, we emphasize the\nsimilarities and differences between X+ and X- trions with respect to the\nhyperfine interaction, which turn out to be in perfect agreement with the\ntheoretical description.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Apr 2009 15:22:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-10"}

Second, in some\nspecial cases we show how to amplify the acceptance probability for good\nwitnesses to 1, making a step towards the proof that QMA with one-sided error\nis equal to QMA.
