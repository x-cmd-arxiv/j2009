Direct tracking of the lung\ntumor during radiation therapy is very difficult without implanted fiducial\nmarkers. Indirect tracking relies on the correlation of the tumor's motion and\nthe surrogate's motion. The present paper presents an analysis of the\ncorrelation between the tumor motion and the diaphragm motion in order to\nevaluate the potential use of diaphragm as a surrogate for tumor motion. We\nhave analyzed the correlation between diaphragm motion and superior-inferior\nlung tumor motion in 32 fluoroscopic image sequences from 10 lung cancer\npatients. A simple linear model and a more complex linear model that accounts\nfor phase delays between the two motions have been used. Results show that the\ndiaphragm is a good surrogate for tumor motion prediction for most patients,\nresulting in an average correlation factor of 0.94 and 0.98 with each model\nrespectively. The model that accounts for delays leads to an average\nlocalization prediction error of 0.8mm and an error at the 95% confidence level\nof 2.1mm. However, for one patient studied, the correlation is much weaker\ncompared to other patients. This indicates that, before using diaphragm for\nlung tumor prediction, the correlation should be examined on a\npatient-by-patient basis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2009 19:08:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

It is supposed that the boron interstitials are\ngenerated continuously during annealing due to dissolution or rearrangement of\nthe clusters of impurity atoms which are formed in the ion-implanted layers\nwith impurity concentration above the solubility limit. The local elastic\nstresses arising due to the difference of boron atomic radius and atomic radius\nof silicon also contribute to the generation of boron interstitials.

The calculated profile of boron\ndistribution after thermal treatment agrees well with the experimental data\nthat confirms the adequacy of the model.

The summation theorems for flux variances\nare shown to depend on the size of the measurement time window ($\\epsilon$),\nwithin which reaction events are counted for measuring a single flux. The\ndegree of the $\\epsilon$-dependency can become significant for processes\ninvolving multi-time-scale dynamics and is estimated by introducing a new\nmeasure of time scale separation.

The metallicity\nof the LMC decreases linearly as -0.047+/-0.003 dex/kpc out to ~8 kpc from the\ncentre. In the SMC, [Fe/H] has a constant value of ~ -1.25+/-0.01 dex up to ~\n12 kpc.

The\nmetallicity of the LMC, as traced by different populations, bears the signature\nof two major star forming episodes: the first one constituting a thick\ndisc/halo population and the second one a thin disc and bar due to a close\nencounter with the MW and SMC.

In a short wavelength regime where semiclassical\ntheories are most relevant, such transport phenomena, being quintessentially\ninterference based, are difficult to understand with the system's specific\nlong-time classical dynamics. Fortunately, semiclassical methods applied to\nwave packet propagation can provide a natural approach to understanding the\nconnections, even though they are known to break down progressively as time\nincreases. This is due to the fact that some long-time transport properties can\nbe deduced from intermediate-time behavior. Thus, these methods need only\nretain validity and be carried out on much shorter time scales than the\ntransport phenomena themselves in order to be valuable. The initial value\nrepresentation of the semiclassical propagator of Herman and Kluk [M. F. Herman\nand E. Kluk, Chem.

The outer bound is based on a channel enhancement that creates\na degraded broadcast channel for which the capacity region is known.

Two type cloak materials are proposed and\ninstalled in the each layer, respectively. The outer layer cloak of the GL\ndouble layered cloak has the invisible function, the inner layer cloak has\nfully absorption function. The GL double layered metamaterials are weak\ndegenerative and weak dispersive. When the source is located outside of the GL\ndouble layered cloak, the excited EM wave field propagation outside of the\ndouble layered cloak is as same as in free space and never be disturbed by the\ncloak; also, the exterior EM wave can not penetrate into the inner layer and\nconcealment. When local sources are located inside of the GL double cloaked\nconcealment with the normal EM materials, the excited EM wave is propagating\nunder Maxwell equation governing, it is complete absorbed by the inner layer\ncloak of GL double cloak and never propagate to outside of the inner layer of\nthe GL cloak, moreover, the EM wavefield in concealment never be disturbed by\nthe cloak. The GL doubled layered cloak is a robust cloak and has complete and\nsufficient invisibility functions. Its concealment is the normal\nelectromagnetic environment. Our EM GL double layered cloak is different from\nconventional common cloak. The 3D GL EM modeling simulations for the double\nlayered cloak are presented. The GL method is an effective physical simulation\nmethod and is fully different from the conventional methods.

They have been proposed as the carriers of the Aromatic\nInfrared Bands (AIBs) observed in emission in the mid-IR. They likely have a\nsignificant contribution to various features of the extinction curve such as\nthe 220 nm bump,the far-UV rise and the diffuse interstellar bands. Emission\nbands are also expected in the far-IR, which are better fingerprints of\nmolecular identity than the AIBs. They will be searched for with the Herschel\nSpace Observatory. Rotational emission is also expected in the mm range for\nthose molecules which carry significant dipole moments. Despite spectroscopic\nstudies in the laboratory, no individual PAH species could be identified. This\nemphasises the need for an investigation on where interstellar PAHs come from\nand how they evolve due to environmental conditions: ionisation and\ndissociation upon UV irradiation, interactions with electrons, gas and dust.\nThere is also evidence for PAH species to contribute to the depletion of heavy\natoms from the gas phase, in particular Si and Fe. This paper illustrates how\nlaboratory work can be inspired from observations. In particular there is a\nneed for understanding the chemical properties of PAHs and PAH-related species,\nincluding very small grains, in physical conditions that mimic those found in\ninterstellar space. This motivates a joint effort between astrophysicists,\nphysicists and chemists. Such interdisciplinary studies are currently\nperformed, taking advantage of the PIRENEA set-up, a cold ion trap dedicated to\nastrochemistry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2009 08:41:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-22"}

I analyze the stochastic effects introduced by\nthe sampling of the stellar initial mass function (SIMF) in the derivation of\nthe individual masses and the CMF and I establish that such effects are the\nlargest contributor to the observational uncertainties. An analytical solution,\nvalid in the limit where uncertainties are small, is provided to establish the\nrange of cluster masses over which the CMF slope can be obtained with a given\naccuracy. The validity of the analytical solution is extended to higher mass\nuncertainties using Monte Carlo simulations and the Gamma approximation. The\nvalue of the Poisson mass is calculated for a large range of ages and a variety\nof filters for solar-metallicity clusters measured with single-filter\nphotometry. A method that uses the code CHORIZOS is presented to simultaneously\nderive masses, ages, and extinctions. The classical method of using unweighted\nUBV photometry to simultaneously establish ages and extinctions of stellar\nclusters is found to be unreliable for clusters older than approx. 30 Ma, even\nfor relatively large cluster masses. On the other hand, augmenting the filter\nset to include longer-wavelength filters and using weights for each filter\nincreases the range of masses and ages that can be accurately measured with\nunresolved photometry. Nevertheless, a relatively large range of masses and\nages is found to be dominated by SIMF sampling effects that render the observed\nmasses useless, even when using UBVRIJHK photometry. A revision of some\nliterature results affected by these effects is presented and possible\nsolutions for future observations and analyses are suggested.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2009 10:24:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-24"}

Many of these proteins are 'two-state folders',\ni.e. proteins that fold rather directly from the denatured state to the native\nstate, without populating metastable intermediate states. A central question is\nhow to characterize the instable, partially folded conformations of two-state\nproteins, in particular the rate-limiting transition-state conformations\nbetween the denatured and the native state. These partially folded\nconformations are short-lived and cannot be observed directly in experiments.\nHowever, experimental data from detailed mutational analyses of the folding\ndynamics provide indirect access to transition states.

We present HST photometry of the late-type dwarf galaxy NGC 1705\nobserved with the WFPC2 in the U and B bands, and with the ACS/HRC in the U, V,\nand I bands.

For the central\nregions of the galaxy, where HST-NICMOS J and H photometry is also available,\nwe present U, B, V, I, J, H CMDs of the 256 objects with magnitudes measured in\nall bands. While our previous study based on V, I, J and H data allowed us to\ntrace the star formation history of NGC 1705 back to a Hubble time, the new\ndata provide a better insight on its recent evolution. With the method of the\nsynthetic CMDs, we confirm the presence of two strong bursts of star formation\n(SF). The older of the two bursts (B1) occurred between ~ 10 and 15 Myr ago,\nwhile the younger burst (B2) started ~ 3 Myr ago, and it is still active. The\nstellar mass produced by B2 amounts to ~ 10^6 msun, and it is a factor of ~ 3\nlower for B1. The interburst phase was likely characterized by a much lower\nlevel of SF rather than by its complete cessation. The two bursts show distinct\nspatial distributions: while B1 is centrally concentrated, B2 is more diffused,\nand presents ring and arc-like structures that remind of an expanding shell.\nThis suggests a feedback mechanism, in which the expanding superbubble observed\nin NGC 1705, likely generated by the (10-15) Myr burst, triggered the current\nstrong SF activity. From the HRC data, we identified 12 star clusters (plus the\nSSC) in the central region of NGC 1705, 10 of which have photometry in all the\nUBVIJH bands.

We detected H2O, CH4, C2H2, C2H6,\nCO, H2CO, CH3OH, HCN, and NH3 and we conducted a sensitive search for CH3D. We\nreport rotational temperatures, production rates, and mixing ratios (with\nrespect to H2O) at heliocentric distances of 1.49 AU (Nov. 2004) and 1.21 AU\n(Jan. 2005). We highlight three principal results: (1) The mixing ratios of\nparent volatiles measured at 1.49 AU and 1.21 AU agree within confidence\nlimits, consistent with homogeneous composition in the mean volatile release\nfrom the nucleus of C/2004 Q2. Notably, the relative abundance of C2H6/C2H2 is\nsubstantially higher than those measured in other comets, while the mixing\nratios C2H6/H2O, CH3OH/H2O, and HCN/H2O are similar to those observed in\ncomets, referred to as \"organics-normal\". (2) The spin temperature of CH4 is >\n35-38 K, an estimate consistent with the more robust spin temperature found for\nH2O. (3) We obtained a 3s upper limit of CH3D/CH4 < 0.020 (D/H < 0.005). This\nlimit suggests that methane released from the nucleus of C/2004 Q2 is not\ndominated by a component formed in extremely cold (near 10 K) environments.\nFormation pathways of both interstellar and nebular origin consistent with the\nmeasured D/H in methane are discussed. Evaluating the relative contributions of\nthese pathways requires further modeling of chemistry including both gas-phase\nand gas-grain processes in the natal interstellar cloud and in the\nprotoplanetary disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2009 15:17:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 2 May 2009 22:09:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}
