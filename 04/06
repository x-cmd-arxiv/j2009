The general configuration\nof this type is derived and shown to exhibit different branches, with different\nasymptotic behaviors. In particular, for the special fine tuning\n$m^2=\\pm1/(2l^2)$, solutions with logarithmic fall-off arise, while in the\nrange $m^2>-1/(2l^2)$, spacetimes with Schrodinger isometry group are admitted\nas solutions. Solutions that are asymptotically AdS$_3$, both for\nBrown-Henneaux and for the weakened boundary conditions, are also identified.\nThe metric function that characterizes the profile of the AdS-wave behaves as a\nmassive excitation on the spacetime, with an effective mass given by\n$m_{eff}^2=m^2-1/(2l^2)$. For the critical value $m^2=-1/(2l^2)$, the value of\nthe effective mass precisely saturates the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound for the\nAdS$_3$ space where the wave is propagating on. The analogies with the AdS-wave\nsolutions of topologically massive gravity are also discussed. Besides, we\nconsider the coupling of both massive deformations to Einstein gravity and find\nthe exact configurations for the complete theory, discussing all the different\nbranches exhaustively. One of the effects of introducing the Chern-Simons\ngravitational term is that of breaking the degeneracy in the effective mass of\nthe generic modes of pure New Massive Gravity, producing a fine structure due\nto parity violation. Another effect is that the zoo of exact logarithmic\nspecimens becomes considerably enlarged.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Apr 2009 17:21:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 May 2009 18:43:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-17"}

However, planet formation in such close\nbinary systems is a challenge to current theory. One of the major theoretical\nproblems occurs in the intermediate stage-planetesimals accretion into\nplanetary embryos-during which the companion's perturbations can stir up the\nrelative velocites(dV) of planetesimals and thus slow down or even cease their\ngrowth. However, all previous studies assumed a 2-dimentional (2D) disk and a\ncoplanar binary orbit. Extending previous studies by including a 3D gas disk\nand an inclined binary orbit with small relative inclination of i_B=0.1-5 deg,\nwe numerically investigate the conditions for planetesimal accretion at 1-2 AU,\nan extension of the habitable zone(1-1.3 AU), around alpha Centauri A in this\npaper. Inclusion of the binary inclination leads to: (1) differential orbital\nphasing is realized in the 3D space, and thus different-sized bodies are\nseparated from each other; (2) total impact rate becomes lower, and impacts\nmainly occur between similar-sized bodies; (3) accretion is more favored, but\nthe balance between accretion and erosion remains uncertain, and the \"possible\naccretion region\" extends up to 2AU when assuming an optimistic Q*(critical\nspecific energy that leads to catastrophic fragmentation); and (4) impact\nvelocities (dV) are significantly reduced but still much larger than their\nescape velocities, which infers that planetesimals grow by means of type II\nrunaway mode. As a conclusion, inclusion of a small binary inclination is a\npromising mechanism that favors accretion, opening a possibility that planet\nformation in close binary systems can go through the difficult stage of\nplanetesimals accretion into planetary embryos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2009 06:33:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2009 18:54:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Special coupling\nof the finite elements ensures that the resultant discretisations are\nconsistent with the \\pde to as high an order as desired. Computer algebra\nhandles the enormous algebraic details as seen in the specific application to\nthe Ginzburg--Landau equation. However, higher order models in 2D appear to\nrequire a mixed numerical and algebraic approach that is also developed. Being\ndriven by the residuals of the equations, the modelling here may be\nstraightforwardly adapted to a wide class of reaction-diffusion differential\nand lattice equations in multiple space dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2009 07:14:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-07"}

For any k >=\n2 and eps>0, if P != NP this ratio cannot be improved to k-1-eps, and under the\nunique games conjecture this ratio cannot be improved to k-eps. One key idea is\nto replace individual constraints by others that have better rounding\nproperties but the same nonnegative integral solutions; another critical\ningredient is knapsack-cover inequalities. Second, for packing integer programs\n{max cx: Ax <= b, 0 <= x <= d} where A has at most k nonzeroes per column, we\ngive a (2k^2+2)-approximation algorithm. Our approach builds on the iterated LP\nrelaxation framework.

The turbulence is inhomogeneous with respect to the vertical direction.\nThis manifests in different lateral and vertical two-particle dispersion and in\na dependence of the dispersion on the initial tracer position for short and\nintermediate times. Similar to homogeneous isotropic turbulence, the dispersion\nproperties depend in addition on the initial pair separation and yield a\nshort-range Richardson-like scaling regime of two-particle dispersion for\ninitial separations close to the Kolmogorov dissipation length. The Richardson\nconstant is about half the value of homogeneous isotropic turbulence.

However, the frequent occurrence of nanoflares requires that\nflare-hot plasma be present in the corona at all times. Its detection has\nproved elusive until now, in part because the intensities are predicted to be\nvery faint. Here we report on the analysis of an active region observed with\nfive filters by Hinode/XRT in November 2006. We have used the filter ratio\nmethod to derive maps of temperature and emission measure both in soft and hard\nratios. These maps are approximate in that the plasma is assumed to be\nisothermal along each line-of-sight. Nonetheless, the hardest available ratio\nreveals the clear presence of plasma around 10 MK. To obtain more detailed\ninformation about the plasma properties, we have performed Monte Carlo\nsimulations assuming a variety of non-isothermal emission measure distributions\nalong the lines-of-sight. We find that the observed filter ratios imply\nbi-modal distributions consisting of a strong cool (log T ~ 6.3-6.5) component\nand a weaker (few percent) and hotter (6.6 < log T < 7.2) component. The data\nare consistent with bi-modal distributions along all lines of sight, i.e.,\nthroughout the active region. We also find that the isothermal temperature\ninferred from a filter ratio depends sensitively on the precise temperature of\nthe cool component. A slight shift of this component can cause the hot\ncomponent to be obscured in a hard ratio measurement. Consequently, temperature\nmaps made in hard and soft ratios tend to be anti-correlated. We conclude that\nthis observation supports the presence of widespread nanoflaring activity in\nthe active region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2009 10:03:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

We provide here an empirical\nstudy of the cross-correlation between all these different events, and their\nrespective impact on future price changes. We define and extract from the data\nthe \"bare\" impact these events would have, if they were to happen in isolation.\nFor large tick stocks, we show that a model where the bare impact of all events\nis permanent and non-fluctuating is in good agreement with the data. For small\ntick stocks, however, bare impacts must contain a history dependent part,\nreflecting the internal fluctuations of the order book. We show that this\neffect can be accurately described by an autoregressive model on the past order\nflow.

As a result we found that imperfections present in the\nprocess of preparation of test states and as well as in measurements of the\nconsidered ion trap system do not limit the control of the implementation of\nthe desired channel. Even imperfect preparation of test state and subsequent\nmeasurements still provide sufficient resources for the complete\nquantum-channel tomography.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2009 13:52:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-07"}

Towers","title":"Solvable Lie A-algebras","comments":null,"journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"math.RA math.RT","license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","abstract":"  A finite-dimensional Lie algebra $L$ over a field $F$ is called an\n$A$-algebra if all of its nilpotent subalgebras are abelian. This is analogous\nto the concept of an $A$-group: a finite group with the property that all of\nits Sylow subgroups are abelian. These groups were first studied in the 1940s\nby Philip Hall, and are still studied today. Rather less is known about\n$A$-algebras, though they have been studied and used by a number of authors.\nThe purpose of this paper is to obtain more detailed results on the structure\nof solvable Lie $A$-algebras. It is shown that they split over each term in\ntheir derived series. This leads to a decomposition of $L$ as $L = A_{n}\n\\dot{+} A_{n-1} \\dot{+} ... \\dot{+} A_0$ where $A_i$ is an abelian subalgebra\nof $L$ and $L^{(i)} = A_{n} \\dot{+} A_{n-1} \\dot{+} ... \\dot{+} A_{i}$ for each\n$0 \\leq i \\leq n$. It is shown that the ideals of $L$ relate nicely to this\ndecomposition: if $K$ is an ideal of $L$ then $K = (K \\cap A_n) \\dot{+} (K \\cap\nA_{n-1}) \\dot{+} ... \\dot{+} (K \\cap A_0)$. When $L^2$ is nilpotent we can\nlocate the position of the maximal nilpotent subalgebras: if $U$ is a maximal\nnilpotent subalgebra of $L$ then $U = (U \\cap L^2) \\oplus (U \\cap C)$ where $C$\nis a Cartan subalgebra of $L$. If $L$ has a unique minimal ideal $W$ then $N =\nZ_L(W)$. If, in addition, $L$ is strongly solvable the maximal nilpotent\nsubalgebras of $L$ are $L^2$ and the Cartan subalgebras of $L$ (that is, the\nsubalgebras that are complementary to $L^2$.) Necessary and sufficient\nconditions are given for such an algebra to be an $A$-algebra. Finally, more\ndetailed structure results are given when the underlying field is algebraically\nclosed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2009 13:33:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2009 10:46:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-30"}

To hunt for effects of Kaluza-Klein (KK)\nexcitations of known fermions and bosons is very much in the agenda of the LHC.\nThese KK states arise when the SM particles penetrate in the extra space-like\ndimension(s). In this paper, we consider a 5d scenario, called `Universal Extra\nDimension', where the extra space coordinate, compactified on an orbifold\n$S^1/Z_2$, is accessed by {\\em all} the particles. The KK number ($n$) is\nconserved at all tree level vertices. This entails the production of KK states\nin pairs and renders the lightest KK particle stable, which leaves the detector\ncarrying away missing energy. The splitting between different KK flavors is\ncontrolled by the zero mode masses and the bulk- and brane-induced one-loop\nradiative corrections. We concentrate on the production of an $n=1$ KK\nelectroweak gauge boson in association with an $n=1$ KK quark. This leads to a\nsignal consisting of {\\em only one} jet, one or more leptons and missing $p_T$.\nFor definiteness we usually choose the inverse radius of compactification to be\n$R^{-1} = 500$ GeV, which sets the scale of the lowest lying KK states.

For $T_c/T_f \\ll 1$,\ncreep/damage occurs sufficiently fast compared with nucleation of sliding,\ncausing bonds to break, and the bottom part of the mass undergoes a\nfragmentation process with the creation of a heterogeneous population of\nsliding blocks. For the intermediate regime $T_c/T_f \\sim 1$, a macroscopic\ncrack nucleates and propagates along the location of the largest curvature\nassociated with the change of slope from the stable frictional state in the\nupper part to the unstable frictional sliding state in the lower part. The\nother important parameter is the Young modulus $Y$ which controls the\ncorrelation length of displacements in the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2009 15:01:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}
