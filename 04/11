We really need to know the\nprobability that the time series is - or is not - compatible with the null\nhypothesis that the measurements are derived from noise. This probability can\nbe calculated by Bayesian analysis, but this requires one to specify and\nevaluate a second hypothesis, that the time series does contain a contribution\nother than noise. We approach the problem of identifying this function in two\nways. We first propose three simple conditions that it seems reasonable to\nimpose on this function, and show that these conditions may be satisfied by a\nsimple function with one free parameter. We then define two different ways of\ncombining information derived from two independent power estimates.

It is often argued that the three methods differ in the treatment of\nhigher orders only and therefore the full difference should be treated as\ntheoretical error. Recently other arguments either in favor of FOPT, CIPT or\nRCPT have been given, but none of those is able to combine all three to a\nsingle value in the strong coupling constant. In this note I will show that\nFOPT alone has a much larger uncertainty than previously assumed and therefore\nagrees within error with CIPT. Furthermore a more appropriate matching of the\ndifferent schemes used in RCPT reduces the difference to the CIPT result by a\nfactor of 6.
