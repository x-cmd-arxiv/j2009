In General\nRelativity the stress-energy is not covariant because it violates a gauge\nsymmetry, but a gravitational theory without fundamental spin 2 gauge\ninvariance must either lack a stress-energy operator or have a non-relativistic\ngraviton. The latter option is incompatible with the principle of equivalence,\nthough such theories are not necessarily ruled out at low energies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Apr 2009 17:21:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2009 18:08:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-01"}

We study the paramagnetic phases of this theory at\nthree quarters filling, where it is a model of Na_0.5CoO_2, Rb_0.5CoO_2, and\nK_0.5CoO_2. This theory has two bands of fermionic quasi-particles: one of\nwhich is filled or nearly filled and hence weakly correlated; the other is\nhalf-filled or nearly half-filled and hence strongly correlated. Further\nresults depend strongly on the sign of the hopping integral, t. The light band\nis always filled for t>0, but only becomes filled for |Delta/t|>=1.5 for t<0,\nwhere Delta is the difference in the site energies of the two sublattices. A\nmetal--charge transfer insulator transition occurs at |Delta/t|=5.0 for t>0 and\n|Delta/t|=8.0 for t<0. In the charge transfer insulator complete charge\ndisproportionation occurs: one sublattice is filled and the other in half\nfilled.

Instead of considering the static\nproblem of constructing one or ten day ahead distributions for vectors of risk\nfactors, we embed the problem into a dynamic framework, where any time horizon\ncan be consistently simulated. Additionally, we use standard models from\nmathematical finance for each risk factor, whence bridging the worlds of\ntrading and risk management.\n  Our approach is based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs), like the\nHJM-equation or the Black-Scholes equation, governing the time evolution of\nrisk factors, on an empirical calibration method to the market for the chosen\nSDEs, and on an Euler scheme (or high-order schemes) for the numerical\nevaluation of the respective SDEs.

Glycans are involved\nin fundamental biological processes, including protein folding and clearance,\ncell proliferation and apoptosis, development, immune responses, and\npathogenesis. One of the major types of glycans, N-linked glycans, is formed by\nsequential attachments of monosaccharides to proteins by a limited number of\nenzymes. Many of these enzymes can accept multiple N-linked glycans as\nsubstrates, thereby generating a large number of glycan intermediates and their\nintermingled pathways. Motivated by the quantitative methods developed in\ncomplex network research, we investigated the large-scale organization of such\nN-linked glycosylation pathways in mammalian cells. The N-linked glycosylation\npathways are extremely modular, and are composed of cohesive topological\nmodules that directly branch from a common upstream pathway of glycan\nsynthesis. This unique structural property allows the glycan production between\nmodules to be controlled by the upstream region. Although the enzymes act on\nmultiple glycan substrates, indicating cross-talk between modules, the impact\nof the cross-talk on the module-specific enhancement of glycan synthesis may be\nconfined within a moderate range by transcription-level control.

In this context, the discovery of a subluminous type II-linear\nevent is even more interesting.

Spectroscopic and photometric observations of SN\n1999ga allow us to constrain the energetics of the explosion and to estimate\nthe mass of the ejected material, shedding light on the nature of the\nprogenitor star in the final stages of its life.

Despite the lack of early-time observations, we provide\nreasonable evidence that SN 1999ga was probably a type II-linear supernova that\nejected a few solar masses of material, with a very small amount of radioactive\nelements of the order of 0.01 solar masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Apr 2009 18:54:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

We are interested in the angular momentum (J) redistribution\nin the disk-halo system. We confirm the previous results and quantify for the\nfirst time the dual role that the DM halos play in the bar evolution: more\ncentrally concentrated halos dilute the dynamical processes, such as\nspontaneous bar instability and vertical buckling instability, and slowdown the\nJ transfer, while facilitating it in the secular phase. Within the corotation\nradius (Rcr), the disk J remains nearly constant, as long as Rcr stays within\nthe disk -- a sign that the lost J to the outer disk and the halo is being\ncompensated by an influx of fresh J due to the outward motion of Rcr. This is\nfeasible as long as the bar slowdown dominates the loss of J inside Rcr. We\nfind that in some models the bar pattern speed stalls for prolonged time\nperiods when Rcr is located outside the disk. This phenomenon appears\nconcurrent with the near absence of J transfer between the disk and the halo.\nFurthermore, we confirm that stellar bars generally display the corotation to\nbar size ratios in the range of ~1-1.4, but only between the times of the first\nbuckling and Rcr leaving the disk. The corotation-to-disk size ratio emerges as\nan important dynamic discriminator between various stages of barred disk\nevolution.

It is difficult for feedback from near the\naccretion disk to directly impact dense molecular clouds at ~kpc. But if such\nfeedback can drive a weak wind or outflow in the hot, diffuse ISM (a relatively\n'easy' task), then in the wake of such an outflow passing over a cold cloud, a\ncombination of instabilities will drive the cloud material to effectively\nexpand in the direction perpendicular to the outflow. Such expansion\ndramatically increases the effective cross section of the cloud material and\nmakes it more susceptible to ionization and momentum coupling from absorption\nof the incident quasar radiation field. Even a moderate effect of this nature\ncan dramatically alter the ability of clouds at large radii to be fully ionized\nand driven into a secondary outflow by radiation pressure. Since the amount of\nmomentum and volume which can be ionized by observed quasar radiation field is\nmore than sufficient to affect the entire cold gas supply once it has been\naltered in this manner (and the 'initial' feedback need only initiate a\nmoderate wind in the low-density hot gas), this reduces by an order of\nmagnitude the required energy budget for feedback to affect a host galaxy.\nInstead of ~5% of the radiated energy (~100% momentum) needed if the initial\nfeedback must directly heat or blow out the galactic gas, if only ~0.5% of the\nluminosity (~10% momentum) can couple to drive the initial hot outflow, this\nmechanism could be efficient. This amounts to hot gas outflow rates from near\nthe accretion disk of only 5-10% of the BH accretion rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Apr 2009 20:05:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2009 20:20:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Let us remind that\nthe NP class is called the class of \"Non Deterministic Polynomial\" languages.\nUsing the meta argument that results in Mathematics should be \"time\nindependent\" as they are reproducible, the paper shows that the P!=NP assertion\nis impossible to prove in the a-temporal framework of Mathematics. In a\nprevious version of the report, we use a similar argument based on randomness\nto show that the P = NP assertion was also impossible to prove, but this part\nof the paper was shown to be incorrect. So, this version deletes it. In fact,\nthis paper highlights the time dependence of the complexity for any NP problem,\nlinked to some pseudo-randomness in its heart.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Apr 2009 09:16:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2010 11:43:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 24 Mar 2016 23:30:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-28"}

In recent years a paradigm has arisen\nin which \"soft\" X-ray states are associated with an inner disc radius at, or\nvery close to, the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) around the black\nhole, while in \"hard\" X-ray states the inner edge of the disc is further from\nthe black hole. Models of advective flows suggest that as the X-ray luminosity\ndrops in hard states, the inner disc progressively recedes, from a few to\nhundreds gravitational radii. Recent observations which show broad iron line\ndetections and estimates of the disc component strength suggest that a\nnon-recessed disc could still be present in bright hard states. In this study\nwe present a comprehensive analysis of the spectral components associated with\nthe inner disc, utilising data from instruments with sensitive low-energy\nresponses and including reanalyses of previously published results. A key\ncomponent of the study is to fully estimate systematic uncertainties by e.g.\ninvestigating in detail the effect of having a hydrogen column density that is\nfixed or free to vary. We conclude that for L_x > 0.01 of the Eddington limit,\nspectral fits allow us to constrain the disc to be < 10R_g. There is, however,\nclear evidence that when L_x is between 10^-2-- 10^-3 Eddington, the disc does\nbegin to recede. We include measurements of disc radii in two quiescent black\nhole binaries, and present the inferred evolution of accretion parameters in\nthe entire range of bolometric luminosities 10^-8 -- 1 Eddington. We compare\nour results with theoretical models and note that the implied rate of disc\nrecession with luminosity is consistent with recent empirical results on the\nX-ray timing behaviour of black holes of all masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Apr 2009 10:42:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The velocity (momentum) equation is approximated by a mixed finite\nelement method using the lowest order Nedelec spaces of the first kind. The\ncontinuity equation is approximated by a standard piecewise constant upwind\ndiscontinuous Galerkin scheme. Our main result states that the numerical method\nconverges to a weak solution. The convergence proof consists of two main steps:\n(i) To establish strong spatial compactness of the velocity field, which is\nintricate since the element spaces are only div or curl conforming. (ii) To\nprove that the discontinuous Galerkin approximations converge strongly, which\nis required in view of the nonlinear pressure function. Tools involved in the\nanalysis include a higher integrability estimate for the discontinuous Galerkin\napproximations, a discrete equation for the effective viscous flux, and various\nrenormalized formulations of the discontinuous Galerkin scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Apr 2009 15:32:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-07"}
