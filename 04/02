Previous results\nhave confirmed that a non-negligible fraction of old main-sequence stars is\npresent in the lists of possible members of young stellar kinematic groups. A\ndetailed study of the properties of these samples is needed to separate the\nyoung stars from old main-sequence stars with similar space motion, and\nidentify the origin of these structures. We used stars possible members of the\nyoung (~ 10 - 650 Myr) moving groups from the literature. To determine the age\nof the stars, we used several suitable age indicators for young main sequence\nstars, i.e., X-ray fluxes and other photometric data. We also used\nspectroscopic data, in particular the equivalent width of the lithium line Li I\nand Halpha, to constrain the range of ages of the stars. By combining\nphotometric and spectroscopic data, we were able to separate the young stars\n(10 - 650 Myr) from the old (> 1 Gyr) field ones. We found, in particular, that\nthe Local Association is contaminated by old field stars at the level of ~30%.\nThis value must be considered as the contamination for our particular sample,\nand not of the entire Local Association. For other young moving groups, it is\nmore difficult to estimate the fraction of old stars among possible members.\nHowever, the level of X-ray emission can, at least, help to separate two age\npopulations: stars with <200 Myr and stars older than this. Our results are\nconsistent with a scenario in which the moving groups contain both groups of\nyoung stars formed in a recent star-formation episode and old field stars with\nsimilar space motion. Only by combining X-ray and optical spectroscopic data is\nit possible to distinguish between these two age populations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2009 16:01:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

A heavily coded system\ncorresponds to a low transmission rate with few ARQ re-transmissions, whereas\nlighter coding corresponds to a higher transmitted rate but more\nre-transmissions. The optimum error probability, where optimum refers to the\nmaximization of the average successful throughput, is derived and is shown to\nbe a decreasing function of the average signal-to-noise ratio and of the\nchannel diversity order. A general conclusion of the work is that the optimum\nerror probability is quite large (e.g., 10% or larger) for reasonable channel\nparameters, and that operating at a very small error probability can lead to a\nsignificantly reduced throughput. This conclusion holds even when a number of\npractical ARQ considerations, such as delay constraints and acknowledgement\nfeedback errors, are taken into account.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2009 17:33:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2010 22:35:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

We study both the inverse and direct\ncascades (the `dual cascade'), driven by a homogeneous and isotropic random\nforcing. The key characteristic length of gyrokinetics, the Larmor radius,\ndivides scales into two physically distinct ranges. For scales larger than the\nLarmor radius, we derive the familiar Charney--Hasegawa--Mima (CHM) equation\nfrom the gyrokinetic system, and explain its relationship to gyrokinetics. At\nscales smaller than the Larmor radius, a dual cascade occurs in phase space\n(two dimensions in position space plus one dimension in velocity space) via a\nnonlinear phase-mixing process. We show that at these sub-Larmor scales, the\nturbulence is self-similar and exhibits power law spectra in position and\nvelocity space.

Although terrestrial parallax was pioneered over 2000\nyears ago by Hipparchus (ca. 140 BCE) to measure the distance to the Moon, the\nbaseline of the Earth is so small that terrestrial parallax can generally only\nbe applied to objects in the Solar System. However, there exists a class of\nextreme gravitational microlensing events in which the effects of terrestrial\nparallax can be readily detected and so permit the measurement of the distance,\nmass, and transverse velocity of the lens. Here we report observations of the\nfirst such extreme microlensing event OGLE-2007-BLG-224, from which we infer\nthat the lens is a brown dwarf of mass M=0.056 +- 0.004 Msun, with a distance\nof 525 +- 40 pc and a transverse velocity of 113 +- 21 km/s. The velocity\nplaces the lens in the thick disk, making this the lowest-mass thick-disk brown\ndwarf detected so far. Follow-up observations may allow one to observe the\nlight from the brown dwarf itself, thus serving as an important constraint for\nevolutionary models of these objects and potentially opening a new window on\nsub-stellar objects. The low a priori probability of detecting a thick-disk\nbrown dwarf in this event, when combined with additional evidence from other\nobservations, suggests that old substellar objects may be more common than\npreviously assumed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2009 20:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 May 2009 07:23:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

The Si$^{34}$S line detected\nin region I shows a large expansion velocity of 16 km/s due to strong wing\ncomponents, indicating that the emission may arise from a shock region in the\ninnermost envelope. In region II, the P.A. of the most copious mass loss\ndirection was found to be 120 +/- 10 degrees, which may correspond to the\nequatorial direction of the star. Region II contains a torus-like feature.\nThese two regions may have emerged due to significant differences in the size\ndistributions of the dust particles in the two regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2009 07:00:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

This work focuses on developing a\nfull-life-cycle software toolset for creating and maintaining Semantic Web\nServices (SWSs) based on the Web Service Modelling Ontology (WSMO) framework. A\nmain part of WSMO-based SWS is service capability - a declarative description\nof Web service functionality. A formal syntax and semantics for such a\ndescription is provided by Web Service Modeling Language (WSML), which is based\non different logical formalisms, namely, Description Logics, First-Order Logic\nand Logic Programming. A WSML description of a Web service capability is\nrepresented as a set of complex logical expressions (axioms). We develop a\nspecialized user-friendly tool for constructing and editing WSMO-based SWS\ncapabilities. Since the users of this tool are not specialists in first-order\nlogic, a graphical way for constricting and editing axioms is proposed. The\ndesigned process for constructing logical expressions is ontology-driven, which\nabstracts away as much as possible from any concrete syntax of logical\nlanguage.

We infer a relatively narrow\nrange for the initial masses of the progenitor system: M_{10} = 2.3 +/- 0.2\nM_sun and M_{20} = 1.7 +/- 0.2 M_sun, where M_{10} and M_{20} are the initial\nmasses of the progenitors of the white dwarf and Regulus, respectively. In this\nscenario, the age of the Regulus system would exceed 1 Gyr. We also show that\nRegulus, with a current orbital period of 40 days, has an interesting future\nahead of it. This includes (i) a common envelope phase, and, quite possibly,\n(ii) an sdB phase, followed by (iii) an AM CVn phase with orbital periods < 1\nhr. Binary evolution calculations are presented in support of this scenario. We\nalso discuss alternative possibilities, emphasizing the present uncertainties\nin binary evolution theory. Thus, this one particular star system illustrates\nmany different aspects of binary stellar evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2009 14:10:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}
