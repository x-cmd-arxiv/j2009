We find that additional structures along\nthe line-of-sight increase the strong-lensing optical depth by ~10-25%, while\nstrong-lensing cross-sections of individual clusters are frequently boosted by\nas much as ~50%. The enhancement is mainly due to structures that are not\ncorrelated with the lens. Cluster galaxies increase the strong-lensing optical\ndepth by up to a factor of 2, while interloping galaxies are not significant.\nWe conclude that these effects need to be taken into account for predictions of\nthe giant arc abundance, but they are not large enough to fully account for the\nreported discrepancy between predicted and observed abundances. Furthermore, we\nfind that Einstein radii defined via the area enclosed by the critical curve\nare 10-30% larger than those defined via radial surface mass density profiles.\nThe contributions of radial and tangential arcs to the radial distribution of\narcs can be clearly distinguished. The radial distribution of tangential arcs\nis very broad and extends out to several Einstein radii.

The Eguchi-Kawai reduction relates gauge theories in\ndifferent numbers of dimensions in the large $N$ limit provided that certain\nconditions are met. In principle, this relation opens up the possibility of\nlearning about the dynamics of 4D gauge theories through techniques only\navailable in lower dimensions. Dimensional reduction can be understood as a\nspecial case of large $N$ equivalence between theories related by an orbifold\nprojection. In this work, we focus on the simplest case of dimensional\nreduction, relating a 4D gauge theory to a 3D gauge theory via an orbifold\nprojection. A necessary condition for the large N equivalence between the 4D\nand 3D theories to hold is that certain discrete symmetries in the two theories\nmust not be broken spontaneously. In pure 4D Yang-Mills theory, these\nsymmetries break spontaneously as the size of one of the spacetime dimensions\nshrinks. An analysis of the effect of adjoint fermions on the relevant\nsymmetries of the 4D theory shows that the fermions help stabilize the\nsymmetries. We consider the same problem from the point of view of the lower\ndimensional 3D theory and find that, surprisingly, adjoint fermions are not\ngenerally enough to stabilize the necessary symmetries of the 3D theory. In\nfact, a rich phase diagram arises, with a complicated pattern of symmetry\nbreaking. We discuss the possible causes and consequences of this finding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2009 19:07:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Apr 2009 22:58:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 21 Aug 2009 01:13:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-17"}

The dynamical friction effects calculated on the basis of this\nself-consistent model are small enough that the observed spatial distribution\nof the globular clusters poses no difficulty, and the apparent paradox is\nresolved.

We detect luminous X-ray counterparts in five LABs, implying a\nlarge fraction of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in LABs, f_AGN = 17% down to\nL_2-32keV ~ 10^44 erg/s. All of the AGN appear to be heavily obscured, with\nspectral indices implying obscuring column densities of N_H > 10^23 cm^-2. The\nAGN fraction should be considered a lower limit, since several more LABs not\ndetected with Chandra show AGN signatures in their mid-infrared emission. We\nshow that the UV luminosities of the AGN are easily capable of powering the\nextended Ly-alpha emission via photo-ionization alone. When combined with the\nUV flux from a starburst component, and energy deposited by mechanical\nfeedback, we demonstrate that 'heating' by a central source, rather than\ngravitational cooling is the most likely power source of LABs. We argue that\nall LABs could be powered in this manner, but that the luminous host galaxies\nare often just below the sensitivity limits of current instrumentation, or are\nheavily obscured. No individual LABs show evidence for extended X-ray emission,\nand a stack equivalent to a >9Ms exposure of an average LAB also yields no\nstatistical detection of a diffuse X-ray component.

In this approach, we start from realistic two-nucleon or two-\nplus three-nucleon interactions. Many-body calculations are performed using a\nfinite harmonic-oscillator (HO) basis. To facilitate convergence for realistic\ninter-nucleon interactions that generate strong short-range correlations, we\nderive effective interactions by unitary transformations that are tailored to\nthe HO basis truncation. For soft realistic interactions this might not be\nnecessary. If that is the case, the NCSM calculations are variational. In\neither case, the ab initio NCSM preserves translational invariance of the\nnuclear many-body problem. In this review, we, in particular, highlight results\nobtained with the chiral two- plus three-nucleon interactions. We discuss\nefforts to extend the applicability of the NCSM to heavier nuclei and larger\nmodel spaces using importance-truncation schemes and/or use of effective\ninteractions with a core. We outline an extension of the ab initio NCSM to the\ndescription of nuclear reactions by the resonating group method technique.

This wave\npropagates radially inwards in $AdS_{d+1}$ space and collapses to form a black\nbrane. Outside its horizon the bulk spacetime for this collapse process may\nsystematically be constructed in an expansion in the amplitude of the source\nfunction, and takes the Vaidya form at leading order in the source amplitude.\nThis solution is dual to a remarkably rapid and intriguingly scale dependent\nthermalization process in the field theory.

The transition between these two\nbehaviors is sharp and can be tuned to the Choptuik scaling solution in\n$R^{d,1}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Apr 2009 06:55:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2009 10:29:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-28"}

All CR points have to be nonminimal and all\ncomplex points have to be \"flat\". Then, adding a positivity condition at\ncomplex points, which is similar to the ellipticity for $n=2$ and excluding the\npossibility of $S$ to contain complex $(n-2)$-dimensional submanifolds, we\nobtain a solution $M$ to the above problem as a projection of a possibly\nsingular Levi-flat hypersurface in $R\\times C^n$. It turns out that $S$ has to\nbe a topological sphere with two complex points and with compact CR orbits,\nalso topological spheres, serving as boundaries of the (possibly singular)\ncomplex leaves of $M$. There are no more global assumptions on $S$ like being\ncontained in the boundary of a strongly pseudoconvex domain, as it was in case\n$n=2$.

Several approaches have been developed to recover\nthe unknown sparse vectors from the given observations, including thresholding,\nsimultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (SOMP), and convex relaxation based on\na mixed matrix norm. Typically, worst-case analysis is carried out in order to\nanalyze conditions under which the algorithms are able to recover any jointly\nsparse set of vectors. However, such an approach is not able to provide\ninsights into why joint sparse recovery is superior to applying standard sparse\nreconstruction methods to each channel individually. Previous work considered\nan average case analysis of thresholding and SOMP by imposing a probability\nmodel on the measured signals. In this paper, our main focus is on analysis of\nconvex relaxation techniques. In particular, we focus on the mixed l_2,1\napproach to multichannel recovery. We show that under a very mild condition on\nthe sparsity and on the dictionary characteristics, measured for example by the\ncoherence, the probability of recovery failure decays exponentially in the\nnumber of channels. This demonstrates that most of the time, multichannel\nsparse recovery is indeed superior to single channel methods. Our probability\nbounds are valid and meaningful even for a small number of signals.

The bispectrum of peaks is not only sensitive to that of the underlying\nmatter density fluctuations, but also to the four-point function. For a\nphysically-motivated, local form of primordial non-Gaussianity in the curvature\nperturbation, we show that the galaxy bispectrum contains five physically\ndistinct pieces: (i) non-linear gravitational evolution, (ii) non-linear galaxy\nbias, (iii) f_nl, (iv) f_nl^2, and (v) \\gnl.

For a more general form of local-type non-Gaussianity, the\ncoefficient \\fnl^2 can be interpreted as \\tau_nl, which allows us to test\nmulti-field inflation models. The usual terms from Gaussian initial conditions,\nhave the smallest signals in the squeezed configurations, while the others have\nthe largest signals; thus, we can distinguish them easily. We cannot interpret\nthe effects of f_nl on B_g(k_1,k_2,k_3) as a scale-dependent bias, and thus\nreplacing the linear bias in the galaxy bispectrum with the scale-dependent\nbias known for the power spectrum results in an incorrect prediction.

The theoretical curves(U1 vs q and U2 vs q) are derived.\nAlthough these curves can reflect the distribution of U1 vs q and U2 vs q, some\nobservational systems are significantly deviated from these curves. It is\nmainly resulted from the difference in the effective temperatures of the\ncomponents in W UMa systems.The radius and the density of the secondary are\nrelated to the relative energy tran-sfer rate U2: the higher is U2, the greater\nis the expansion and the lower is the density of the secondaries in W UMa\nsystems. The temperature difference of W UMa binary components is correlated\nwith the relative energy transfer rate U1 and decreases with increasing U1.\nThis might suggest that there is a thermal coupling between two components in W\nUMa contact binaries, and that the classif-ication of W UMa contact binaries\ninto A- or W-types depends on the energy tran-sfer from the primary to the\nsecondary. The temperature difference of W UMa bin-ary components is poorly\ncorrelated with the mass of the primary.

Shedding light on the nature of these BSS candidates is\ncrucial, in order to understand the star formation history of dSphs. In this\npaper, we consider BSS candidates in Sculptor and Fornax. In Fornax there are\nstrong hints that the BSS population is contaminated by young stars, whereas in\nSculptor there is no clear evidence of recent star formation. We derive the\nradial and luminosity distribution of BSS candidates from wide field imaging\ndata extending beyond the nominal tidal radius of these galaxies. The\nobservations are compared with the radial distribution of BSSs expected from\ndynamical simulations. In Sculptor the radial distribution of BSS candidates is\nconsistent with that of red horizontal branch (RHB) stars and is in agreement\nwith theoretical expectations for BSSs generated via mass transfer in binaries.\nOn the contrary, in Fornax the radial distribution of BSS candidates is more\nconcentrated than that of all the considered stellar populations. This result\nsupports the hypothesis that most of BSS candidates in Fornax are young stars\nand is consistent with previous studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Apr 2009 08:10:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

We analyse\nthe environments of nearby quasars using number counts of galaxies. We also\nstudy the dependence of group properties to their distance to the nearest\nquasar. The large scale environments are studied by analysing the locations of\nquasars in the luminosity density field. Our study of the number counts of\ngalaxies in quasar environments shows an underdensity of bright galaxies at a\nfew Mpc from quasars. Also, the groups of galaxies that have a quasar closer\nthan 2Mpc are poorer and less luminous than in average. Our analysis on the\nluminosity density field shows that quasars clearly avoid rich superclusters.\nNearby quasars seem to be located in outskirts of superclusters or in filaments\nconnecting them. Our results suggest that quasar evolution may be affected by\ndensity variations both on supercluster scales and in the local environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Apr 2009 12:20:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

However, this theory fails to explain some aging phenotypes such as\nfibrosis and premature aging, since terms such as 'damage' and 'fault' are not\nspecified. Therefore we introduce some crucial modifications of this theory and\narrive at a novel theory: aging of the body is the result of accumulation of\nMisrepair of tissue. It emphasizes: a) it is Misrepair, not the original\ndamage, that accumulates and leads to aging; and b) aging can occur at\ndifferent levels, however aging of the body takes place necessarily on the\ntissue level, but not requiring the aging of cells/molecules. The\nMisrepair-accumulation theory introduced in the present paper unifies the\nunderstanding of the roles of environmental damage, repair, gene regulation,\nand multicellular structure in the aging process.

In the case of the core model, we find good agreement both for\nthe predicted spectral shape and the overall normalization between our earlier\nresults and the H.E.S.S. observations for a primary proton energy $dN/dE\\propto\nE^{-\\alpha}$ with $\\alpha\\sim 2$ or smaller. A broken-power law with\nhigh-energy part $\\alpha=-2.7$ leads to photon fluxes in excess of the Fermi\nmeasurements. The energy spectrum of the photon fluxes obtained by us for the\njet scenario is in all cases at variance with the H.E.S.S. and Fermi\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Apr 2009 15:08:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-05"}

Eight pure H2 rotational lines, from S (0) to S (7), are detected\nand mapped. The H2 emission appears to be associated with the warm gas shocked\nby the multiple outflows present in the region. A comparison between the\nobserved intensities and the predictions of detailed shock models indicates\nthat the emission arises in both slow (12 - 24 km/s) and fast (36 - 53 km/s)\nC-type shocks with an initial ortho-to-para ratio of ~ 1. The present H2\northo-to-para ratio exhibits a large degree of spatial variations. In the\npost-shocked gas, it is usually about 2, i.e. close to the equilibrium value (~\n3). However, around at least two outflows, we observe a region with a much\nlower (~ 0.5) ortho-to-para ratio. This region probably corresponds to gas\nwhich has been heated-up recently by the passage of a shock front, but whose\northo-to-para has not reached equilibrium yet. This, together with the low\ninitial ortho-to-para ratio needed to reproduce the observed emission, provide\nstrong evidence that H2 is mostly in para form in cold molecular clouds. The H2\nlines are found to contribute to 25 - 50% of the total outflow luminosity, and\nthus can be used to ascertain the importance of star formation feedback on the\nnatal cloud. From these lines, we determine the outflow mass loss rate and,\nindirectly, the stellar infall rate, the outflow momentum and the kinetic\nenergy injected into the cloud over the embedded phase. The latter is found to\nexceed the binding energy of individual cores, suggesting that outflows could\nbe the main mechanism for core disruption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Apr 2009 15:43:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}
