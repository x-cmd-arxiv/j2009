We investigate the role of randomized\noutcomes (henceforth, \"lotteries\") in the context of a fundamental and\narchetypical multi-parameter mechanism design problem: selling heterogeneous\nitems to unit-demand bidders. To what extent can a seller improve her revenue\nby pricing lotteries rather than items, and does this modification of the\nproblem affect its computational tractability? Our results show that the\nanswers to these questions hinge on whether consumers can purchase only one\nlottery (the buy-one model) or purchase any set of lotteries and receive an\nindependent sample from each (the buy-many model). In the buy-one model, there\nis a polynomial-time algorithm to compute the revenue-maximizing envy-free\nprices (thus overcoming the inapproximability of the corresponding item pricing\nproblem) and the revenue of the optimal lottery system can exceed the revenue\nof the optimal item pricing by an unbounded factor as long as the number of\nitem types exceeds 4. In the buy-many model with n item types, the profit\nachieved by lottery pricing can exceed item pricing by a factor of O(log n) but\nnot more, and optimal lottery pricing cannot be approximated within a factor of\nO(n^eps) for some eps>0, unless NP has subexponential-time randomized\nalgorithms. Our lower bounds rely on a mixture of geometric and algebraic\ntechniques, whereas the upper bounds use a novel rounding scheme to transform a\nmechanism with randomized outcomes into one with deterministic outcomes while\nlosing only a bounded amount of revenue.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2009 16:30:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-17"}

By applying an\nobservational detection bias for radial velocity surveys, we identify the\npotentially detectable synthetic planets. The properties of these planets are\ncompared in quantitative statistical tests with the properties of a carefully\nselected sub-population of actual exoplanets. We use a two dimensional\nKolmogorov-Smirnov test to compare the mass-distance distributions of synthetic\nand observed planets, as well as 1D KS tests to compare the mass, the semimajor\naxis and the [Fe/H] distributions. We find that some models can account to a\nreasonable degree of significance for the observed properties. We concurrently\naccount for many other observed features, e.g. the \"metallicity effect\". This\ngives us confidence that our model captures several essential features of giant\nplanet formation. Our simulations allow us also to extract the properties of\nthe underlying exoplanet population that are not yet detectable. For example,\nwe have derived the planetary initial mass function (PIMF) and have been led to\nconclude that the planets detected so far represent only the tip of the\niceberg. The PIMF can also be used to predict how the detectable extrasolar\nplanet population will change as the precision of radial velocity surveys\nimproves to an extreme precision of 0.1 m/s.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2009 17:16:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

A soft band (0.5-2 keV) image shows the presence of a bright core in\nthe center surrounded by an extended X-ray corona and two pronounced\nquasi-symmetric, 8 kpc long, arm-like features. Each of this features defines\nthe rim of an ellipsoidal bubble. An additional bubble-like feature, whose\nnorthern rim is located ~2 kpc south of the north-eastern arm, is detected as\nwell. We present surface brightness and temperature profiles across the rims of\nthe bubbles, showing that their edges are sharp and characterized by\ntemperature jumps of about 20-25%. Through a comparison of the observed\nprofiles with theoretical shock models, we demonstrate that a scenario where\nthe bubbles were produced by shocks, probably driven by energy deposited\noff-center by jets, is the most viable explanation to the X-ray morphology\nobserved in the central part of NGC4636. As a confirmation to this scenario,\nradio jets extending towards the bubbles and a central weak X-ray and radio\nsource are detected and are most likely the signs of AGN activity which was\nmore intense in the past. A bright dense core of ~1 kpc radius is observed at\nthe center of NGC4636. A sharp decline in surface brightness from the core to\nthe ambient gas is observed and is not accompanied by a variation in the\ntemperature and thus could not be in thermal pressure equilibrium.

The AGN sample is composed of Type II AGNs identified\nwith flux ratios of narrow-emission lines with S/N > 6. We find that the\nfraction of galaxies hosting an AGN (f_AGN) depends strongly on morphology\ntogether with color, and very weakly on luminosity or velocity dispersion of\nhost galaxies.

The host\ngalaxy color preferred by AGNs is u-r ~2.0 for early-type hosts and u-r=2.0-2.4\nfor late-type hosts. This trend suggests that AGNs are dominantly hosted by\nintermediate-mass late-type galaxies. We also investigate how the accretion\npower varies with galaxy properties. While the Eddington ratio ([OIII] line\nluminosity normalized by black hole mass) ranges over three orders of magnitude\nfor both morphological types, late-type galaxies are the dominant hosts over\nall AGN power.

We demonstrate\nreconstructions with simulated data and investigate the effects of particle\ncomplexity, number of measurements, and the number of photons per measurement.\nThe relatively transparent scaling behavior of our algorithm provides a first\nestimate of the data processing resources required for future single-particle\nimaging experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2009 22:03:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2009 18:47:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 4 May 2009 17:10:38 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2009 21:15:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-04"}

The source of the bias is commonly attributed to noise in the data.\nAssuming a two-tissue compartmental model, we investigate the bias that\noriginates from model error. This bias is an intrinsic property of the\nsimplified linear models used for limited scan durations, and it is exaggerated\nby random noise and numerical quadrature error. Conditions are derived under\nwhich Logan's graphical method either over- or under-estimates the distribution\nvolume in the noise-free case. The bias caused by model error is quantified\nanalytically. The presented analysis shows that the bias of graphical methods\nis inversely proportional to the dissociation rate.

In an open\nannular geometry, Kim and Chan found that a fraction of the solid moment of\ninertia is decoupled from the motion of the oscillator; however, when the\nannulus is blocked by a partition, the decoupled supersolid fraction is locked\nto the oscillator being accelerated by an AC pressure gradient generated by the\nmoving partition. These observations are in accord with superfluid\nhydrodynamics. We apply a low frequency AC pressure gradient in order to search\nfor a superfluid-like response in a supersolid sample. Our results are\nconsistent with zero supersolid flow in response to the imposed low frequency\npressure gradient.

We study an equatorial CH observed simultaneously by HINODE and\nSTEREO on July 27, 2007.

The G band and Ca II H images with high tempo-spatial resolution\nfrom HINODE/BFI and the multi-wavelength data from STEREO/EUVI are utilized to\nstudy the corresponding atmospheric response of different overlying layers.\nResults. We explore an emerging dipole locating at the CH boundary. Mini-scale\narch filaments (AFs) accompanying the emerging dipole were observed with the Ca\nII H line. During the separation of the dipolar footpoints, three AFs appeared\nand expanded in turn. The first AF divided into two segments in its late stage,\nwhile the second and third AFs erupted in their late stages. The lifetimes of\nthese three AFs are 4, 6, 10 minutes, and the two intervals between the three\ndivisions or eruptions are 18 and 12 minutes, respectively. We display an\nexample of mixed-polarity flux emergence of IN fields within the CH and present\nthe corresponding chromospheric response. With the increase of the integrated\nmagnetic flux, the brightness of the Ca II H images exhibits an increasing\ntrend. We also study magnetic flux cancellations of NT fields locating at the\nCH boundary and present the obvious chromospheric and coronal response. We\nnotice that the brighter regions seen in the 171 A images are relevant to the\ninteracting magnetic elements.

Based on morphological and spectral\ncharacteristics of these sources, currently a strong contender to explain the\nnature of these sources is the `alternative' model of Lal & Rao (2007), in\nwhich these sources consist of two pairs of jets, which are associated with two\nunresolved AGNs. Detailed morphological and spectral results on\nmilliarcsecond-scales (mas) provide a crucial test of this model, and hence\nthese sources are excellent candidates to study on mas; {\\it i.e.}, to detect\nhe presence/absence of double nuclei/AGNs, signs of helical/disrupted jets,\nthereby, to investigate spatially resolved/unresolved binary AGN systems and\nproviding clues to understanding the physics of merging of AGNs on mas.
