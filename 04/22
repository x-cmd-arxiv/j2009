We show that for 1/2<g<1, the\npinch-off of the point contact as a function of gate voltage is controlled by a\nnovel quantum critical point, related to a nontrivial intermediate fixed point\nfound previously in the Luttinger liquid model. We predict that the dependence\nof the conductance on gate voltage and temperature near the pinch-off\ntransition collapses onto a universal curve described by a crossover scaling\nfunction. We compute the conductance, the critical exponents and the scaling\nfunction in solvable limits, which include g=1-\\epsilon, g=1/2+\\epsilon and\ng=1/\\sqrt{3}. These results, along with a general scaling analysis provide an\noverall picture of the critical behavior as a function of g. In addition, we\nanalyze the structure of the four terminal conductance of the point contact in\nthe weak tunneling and weak backscattering limits. We find that different\ncomponents of the conductance can have different temperature dependence. We\nidentify a skew conductance G_{XY}, which we predict vanishes as T^\\gamma with\n\\gamma\\ge 2.

Based\non recent experimental evidence from {\\it Arabidopsis}, we assume that at the\nmolecular level, incompatibility between strains is caused by epistatic\ninteractions between two proteins in the plant immune system, the guard and the\nguardee. Within each plant strain, immune reactions occur when the guardee\nprotein is modified by a pathogen effector, and the guard subsequently binds to\nthe guardee, thus precipitating an immune response. However, when guard and\nguardee proteins come from phenotypically distant parents, a hybrid's immune\nsystem can be triggered by erroneous interactions between these proteins even\nin the absence of pathogen attack, leading to severe autoimmune reactions in\nhybrids.

This is demonstrated in a sub-sample of metal-rich RV standards,\nwhich appear to have low surface gravity as measured by the CaH index, yet show\nno other evidence of youth. We also use additional youth diagnostics such as\nlithium absorption and strong H-alpha emission to set more stringent age\nlimits. Eleven M dwarfs with no H-alpha emission or absorption are likely old\n(>400 Myr) and were caught during an X-ray flare. We estimate that our final\nsample of the 144 youngest and nearest low-mass objects in the field is less\nthan 300 Myr old, with 30% of them being younger than 150 Myr and 4 very young\n(<10 Myr), representing a generally untapped and well-characterized resource of\nM dwarfs for intensive planet and disk searches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2009 19:45:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2009 14:41:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

In this paper we present the\nfirst application of a new technique to determine the presence or absence of a\ncentral IMBH in globular clusters that have reached energy equipartition via\ntwo-body relaxation. The method is based on the measurement of the radial\nprofile for the average mass of stars in the system, using the fact that a\nquenching of mass segregation is expected when an IMBH is present. Here we\nmeasure the radial profile of mass segregation using main-sequence stars for\nthe globular cluster NGC 2298 from resolved source photometry based on HST-ACS\ndata. The observations are compared to expectations from direct N-body\nsimulations of the dynamics of star clusters with and without an IMBH. The mass\nsegregation profile for NGC 2298 is quantitatively matched to that inferred\nfrom simulations without a central massive object over all the radial range\nprobed by the observations, that is from the center to about two half-mass\nradii. Profiles from simulations containing an IMBH more massive than ~ 300-500\nMsun (depending on the assumed total mass of NGC 2298) are instead inconsistent\nwith the data at about 3 sigma confidence, irrespective of the IMF and binary\nfraction chosen for these runs.

If the cause of accelerated cosmic expansion is\ndark energy within general relativity (GR), both cosmic distances and structure\ngrowth are governed by the properties of dark energy. Consequently, one may use\nlensing to check for this consistency and test GR. After reviewing the\nphenomenology of such tests, we address one major challenge to such a program.\nThe evolution of the baryonic component of the Universe is highly uncertain and\ncan influence lensing observables, manifesting as modified structure growth for\na fixed cosmic distance scale. Using two proposed methods, we show that one\ncould be led to reject the null hypothesis of GR when it is the true theory if\nthis uncertainty in baryonic processes is neglected.

The correction renders biases\nsmall compared to statistical uncertainties.

Compared to nulling information from\nsmall-scales to mitigate sensitivity to baryonic physics, this internal\ncalibration program should provide limits on deviations from GR that are\nseveral times more constraining.

Recent studies have probed the interaction\nbetween a disk and a terrestrial planet on an eccentric orbit, and the\ninteraction between a disk and a gas giant on a nearly circular orbit, but\nlittle is known about the interaction between a disk and an eccentric gas\ngiant. Such a scenario could arise due to scattering while the disk is still\npresent, or perhaps through planet formation via gravitational instability.

The reduced forms of a certain\nmonomial m[G] in commuting variables x_{ij}, y_{ij}, z_k under reductions\nderived from the relations of a bracket algebra of type C_n, can be interpreted\nas triangulations of P(G). Using these triangulations, the volume of P(G) can\nbe calculated. If we allow variables to commute only when all their indices are\ndistinct, then we prove that the reduced form of m[G], for \"good\" graphs G, is\nunique and yields a canonical triangulation of P(G) in which each simplex\ncorresponds to a noncrossing alternating graph in a type C sense. A special\ncase of our results proves a conjecture of A. N. Kirillov about the uniqueness\nof the reduced form of a Coxeter type element in the bracket algebra of type\nC_n. We also study the bracket algebra of type D_n and show that a family of\nmonomials has unique reduced forms in it. A special case of our results proves\na conjecture of A. N. Kirillov about the uniqueness of the reduced form of a\nCoxeter type element in the bracket algebra of type D_n.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2009 20:28:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2009 20:24:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-02"}

Motivated, in\npart, by recent results of Gupta-Verd\\'{u}-Weissman (GVW) and their underlying\nconnections with the pattern-matching scheme of Kontoyiannis' lossy Lempel-Ziv\nalgorithm, we introduce a non-universal version of the lossy Lempel-Ziv method\n(termed LLZ). The optimality of LLZ for memoryless sources is established, and\nits performance is compared to that of the GVW divide-and-conquer approach.\nExperimental results indicate that the GVW approach often yields better\ncompression than LLZ, but at the price of much higher memory requirements. To\ncombine the advantages of both, we introduce a hybrid algorithm (HYB) that\nutilizes both the divide-and-conquer idea of GVW and the single-database\nstructure of LLZ. It is proved that HYB shares with GVW the exact same\nrate-distortion performance and implementation complexity, while, like LLZ,\nrequiring less memory, by a factor which may become unbounded, depending on the\nchoice or the relevant design parameters. Experimental results are also\npresented, illustrating the performance of all three methods on data generated\nby simple discrete memoryless sources. In particular, the HYB algorithm is\nshown to outperform existing schemes for the compression of some simple\ndiscrete sources with respect to the Hamming distortion criterion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2009 20:54:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-23"}

We see evidence that the\nactive z~4 black hole population is somewhat different than that at lower z. In\nparticular, there is a sharp increase in the space density of the detected\nactive black holes (M_BH >~ 10^8 Msun) between redshifts ~4 and ~2.5. Also, the\nz~4 SDSS quasar mass function has a somewhat flatter high mass-end slope, beta\n= -1.75 +- 0.56, compared to the mass functions based on quasars below z of 3,\nwhich display typical slopes of beta =~ -3.3; the latter are consistent with\nthe mass functions at similar redshifts based on the SDSS Data Release 3 quasar\ncatalog presented by Vestergaard et al.

In the spirit of Nesterov's work, one of the key\nideas of this algorithm is a subtle averaging of sequences of iterates, which\nhas been shown to improve the convergence properties of standard\ngradient-descent algorithms. This paper demonstrates that this approach is\nideally suited for solving large-scale compressed sensing reconstruction\nproblems as 1) it is computationally efficient, 2) it is accurate and returns\nsolutions with several correct digits, 3) it is flexible and amenable to many\nkinds of reconstruction problems, and 4) it is robust in the sense that its\nexcellent performance across a wide range of problems does not depend on the\nfine tuning of several parameters. Comprehensive numerical experiments on\nrealistic signals exhibiting a large dynamic range show that this algorithm\ncompares favorably with recently proposed state-of-the-art methods. We also\napply the algorithm to solve other problems for which there are fewer\nalternatives, such as total-variation minimization, and convex programs seeking\nto minimize the l1 norm of Wx under constraints, in which W is not diagonal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2009 01:05:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-15"}

We adopt the\n\"one-tau photo-oval\" approximation in the comoving frame. Namely, the comoving\nobserver sees radiation coming from a closed surface where the optical depth\nmeasured from the observer is unity; such a surface is called a one-tau\nphoto-oval. In general, the radiative intensity emitted by the photo-oval is\nnon-uniform and anisotropic. Furthermore, the photo-oval surface has a relative\nvelocity with respect to the comoving observer, and therefore, the observed\nintensity suffers from the Doppler effect and aberration. In addition, the\nbackground intensity usually depends on the optical depth. All of these\nintroduce the anisotropy to the radiation field observed by the comoving\nobserver. As a result, the relativistic Eddington factor $f$ generally depends\non the optical depth $\\tau$, the four velocity $u$, and the velocity gradient\n$du/d\\tau$. % In the case of a plane-parallel vertical flow, we found that the\nrelativistic variable Eddington factor $f$ generally decreases as the velocity\ngradient increases, but it increases as the velocity increases for some case.\nWhen the comoving radiation field is uniform, it is well approximated by $3f\n\\sim 1/[ 1+ ({16}/{15})(-{du}/{\\gamma d\\tau}) +(-{du}/{\\gamma d\\tau})^{1.6-2}\n  ]$. When the radiation field in the inertial frame is uniform, on the other\nhand, it is expressed as $f = (1+3\\beta^2)/(3+\\beta^2$).

We show how a\nfractal-like structure, typical of aggregates in natural systems, can be\nincorporated in an approximate way into the aggregation and fragmentation model\nby introducing effective densities and radii. We apply this model to the\nspecial case of marine aggregates in coastal areas and investigate numerically\nthe impact of three different modes of fragmentation: large-scale splitting,\nwhere fragments have similar sizes, erosion, where one of the fragments is much\nsmaller than the other and uniform fragmentation, where all sizes of fragments\noccur with the same probability. We find that the steady state particle size\ndistribution depends strongly on the mode of fragmentation. The resulting size\ndistribution for large-scale fragmentation is exponential. As some aggregate\ndistributions found in published measurements share this latter characteristic,\nthis may indicate that large-scale fragmentation is the primary mode of\nfragmentation in these cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2009 10:03:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2010 14:09:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 2010 10:13:39 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2011 09:20:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-08"}

In the\nrising phase, only absorption lines of H$\\alpha$, H$\\beta$, and H$\\gamma$ were\npresent. Around the maximum, the spectrum showed singly-peaked emission lines\nof H$\\alpha$, He I 5876, He I 6678, He II 4686, and C III/N III as well as\nabsorption lines of Balmer components and He I.

We derive the\nICS HXR emission of Ophiuchus under various scenarios: primary cosmic ray\nmodel, secondary cosmic rays model and neutralino DM annihilation scenario. We\nfurther discuss the predictions of the Warming Ray model for the cluster\natmosphere. Under the assumption to fit the observed HXR emission, we find that\nthe high-E electrons induce various consequences on the cluster atmosphere: i)\nprimary electrons can be marginally consistent with the data provided that\ntheir spectrum is cutoff at E~30(90) MeV for spectral index of 3.5 (4.4); ii)\nsecondary electron models from pp collisions are inconsistent with gamma-ray\nlimits, cosmic ray protons produce too much heating of the IC gas and their\npressure at the cluster center largely exceeds the thermal one; iii) secondary\nelectron models from DM annihilation are inconsistent with gamma-ray and radio\nlimits and electrons produce too much heating of the IC gas at the cluster\ncenter, unless the neutralino annihilation cross section is much lower than the\nproposed value. We conclude that ICS by secondary electrons from both\nneutralino DM annihilation and pp collisions cannot be the mechanism\nresponsible for the HXR excess emission; primary electrons are still a\nmarginally viable solution provided that their spectrum has a low-energy cutoff\nat E~30-90 MeV.

We present a chi^2-empirical\nmethod that derives PDFs from empirical models as a subclass of kernel\nregression methods, and apply it to the SDSS DR5 sample of >75,000 QSOs, which\nis full of ambiguities. Objects with single-peak PDFs show <1% outliers, rms\nredshift errors <0.05 and vanishing redshift bias. At z>2.5, these figures are\n2x better. Outliers result purely from the discrete nature and limited size of\nthe model, and rms errors are dominated by the instrinsic variety of object\ncolours. PDFs classed as ambiguous provide accurate probabilities for\nalternative solutions and thus weights for using both solutions and avoiding\nneedless outliers. E.g., the PDFs predict 78.0% of the stronger peaks to be\ncorrect, which is true for 77.9% of them. Redshift incompleteness is common in\nfaint spectroscopic surveys and turns into a massive undetectable outlier risk\nabove other performance limitations, but we can quantify residual outlier risks\nstemming from size and completeness of the model. We propose a matched\nchi^2-error scale for noisy data and show that it produces correct error\nestimates and redshift distributions accurate within Poisson errors. Our method\ncan easily be applied to future large galaxy surveys, which will benefit from\nthe reliability in ambiguity detection and residual risk quantification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2009 11:44:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

These are found at distances of up to\n67 Mpc and cover the absorbed 2-10 keV luminosity range ~10^38-10^43 ergs/s.\nOur aim is to determine the distribution of the X-ray absorption in the local\nUniverse. Three of these are Compton-thick with column densities just above\n10^24 cm^-2 and high equivalent width FeKa lines (>700 eV). Five more sources\nhave low values of the X-ray to [OIII] flux ratio suggesting that they could be\nassociated with obscured nuclei. Their individual spectra show neither high\nabsorbing columns nor flat spectral indices. However, their stacked spectrum\nreveals an absorbing column density of N_H~10^23 cm^-2. Therefore the fraction\nof absorbed sources (>10^22 cm^-2 could be as high as 55+/-12%. A number of\nSeyfert-2 appear to host unabsorbed nuclei. These are associated with\nlow-luminosity sources Lx < 3x10^41 ergs/s. Their stacked spectrum again shows\nno absorption while inspection of the \\chandra images, where available, shows\nthat contamination from nearby sources does not affect the {\\it XMM-Newton}\nspectra in most cases. Nevertheless, such low luminosity sources are not\ncontributing significantly to the X-ray background flux. When we consider only\nthe brighter, $>10^{41}$ \\lunits, 21 sources, we find that the fraction of\nabsorbed nuclei rises to $75\\pm19 $ % while that of Compton-thick sources to\n15-20%. The fraction of Compton-thick AGN is lower than that predicted by the\nX-ray background synthesis model in the same luminosity and redshift range.}\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2009 13:17:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

For the fermion and boson propagators in QED this requires an {\\it\nansatz} for the full three point vertex. Here we illustrate how the properties\nof gauge invariance, gauge covariance and multiplicative renormalizability\nimpose severe constraints on this fermion-boson interaction, allowing a\nconsistent truncation of the propagator equations. We demonstrate how these\nconditions imply that the 3-point vertex {\\bf in the propagator equations} is\nlargely determined by the behaviour of the fermion propagator itself and not by\nknowledge of the many higher point functions. We give an explicit form for the\nfermion-photon vertex, which in the fermion and photon propagator fulfills\nthese constraints to all orders in leading logarithms for massless QED, and\naccords with the weak coupling limit in perturbation theory at ${\\cal\nO}(\\alpha)$. This provides the first attempt to deduce non-perturbative Feynman\nrules for strong physics calculations of propagators in massless QED that\nensures a more consistent truncation of the 2-point Schwinger-Dyson equations.\nThe generalisation to next-to-leading order and masses will be described in a\nlonger publication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2009 15:55:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-09"}
