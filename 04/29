In the intermediate field regime, the electron resides in a\nsuperposition between the states of the atomic donor potential and that of the\nquantum dot like states at the surface. In addition to determining the effect\nof field and donor depth on the electronic structure, the model also provides a\nbasis to distinguish between a phosphorus and an arsenic donor based on their\nStark signature.

It has been tentatively explained by the possible increase\nof planet formation probability in stellar disks with enhanced amount of\nmetals. However, there are two caveats to this explanation. First, giant stars\nwith planets do not show a metallicity distribution skewed towards metal-rich\nobjects, as found for dwarfs. Second, the correlation with metallicity is not\nvalid at intermediate metallicities, for which it can be shown that giant\nplanets are preferentially found orbiting thick disk stars.\n  None of these two peculiarities is explained by the proposed scenarios of\ngiant planet formation. We contend that they are galactic in nature, and\nprobably not linked to the formation process of giant planets. It is suggested\nthat the same dynamical effect, namely the migration of stars in the galactic\ndisk, is at the origin of both features, with the important consequence that\nmost metal-rich stars hosting giant planets originate from the inner disk, a\nproperty that has been largely neglected until now. We illustrate that a\nplanet-metallicity correlation similar to the observed one is easily obtained\nif stars from the inner disk have a higher percentage of giant planets than\nstars born at the solar radius, with no specific dependence on metallicity. We\npropose that the density of molecular hydrogen in the inner galactic disk (the\nmolecular ring) could play a role in setting the high percentage of giant\nplanets that originate from this region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2009 16:55:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

In the present work, we\nstudy the entanglement entropy in the quantum O(N) model in 1 < d < 3. We use\nan expansion in epsilon = 3-d to evaluate i) the universal geometric correction\nto S for an infinite cylinder divided along a circular boundary; ii) the\nuniversal correction to S due to a finite correlation length. Both corrections\nare different at the Wilson-Fisher and Gaussian fixed points, and the epsilon\n-> 0 limit of the Wilson-Fisher fixed point is distinct from the Gaussian fixed\npoint.

Our numerical scattering experiments reveal that: 1) a significant\nfraction of stars initially bound to the primary hole are scattered into its\ntidal disruption loss cone by gravitational interactions with the secondary\nhole, an enhancement effect that is more pronounced for very unequal-mass\nbinaries; 2) about 25% (40%) of all strongly interacting stars are tidally\ndisrupted by a MBH binary of mass ratio q=1/81 (q=1/243) and eccentricity 0.1;\nand 3) two mechanisms dominate the fueling of the tidal disruption loss cone, a\nKozai non-resonant interaction that causes the secular evolution of the stellar\nangular momentum in the field of the binary, and the effect of close encounters\nwith the secondary hole that change the stellar orbital parameters in a chaotic\nway. For a hard MBH binary of 10^7 solar masses and mass ratio 0.01, embedded\nin an isothermal stellar cusp of velocity dispersion sigma*=100 km/s, the tidal\ndisruption rate can be as large as 1/yr.

The LIRGs are a complete subset of\nthe IRAS Revised Bright Galaxy Sample (RBGS). The LIRGs targeted in GOALS span\nthe full range of nuclear spectral types defined via traditional optical\nline-ratio diagrams as well as interaction stages. They provide an unbiased\npicture of the processes responsible for enhanced infrared emission in galaxies\nin the local Universe. As an example of the analytic power of the\nmulti-wavelength GOALS dataset, we present data for the interacting system VV\n340 (IRAS F14547+2449). Between 80-95% of the total far-infrared emission (or\nabout 5E11 solar luminosities) originates in VV 340 North. While the IRAC\ncolors of VV 340 North and South are consistent with star-forming galaxies,\nboth the Spitzer IRS and Chandra ACIS data indicate the presence of a buried\nAGN in VV 340 North. The GALEX far and near-UV fluxes imply a extremely large\ninfrared \"excess\" (IRX) for the system (IR/FUV = 81) which is well above the\ncorrelation seen in starburst galaxies. Most of this excess is driven by VV 340\nN, which alone has an IR excess of nearly 400. The VV 340 system seems to be\ncomprised of two very different galaxies - an infrared luminous edge-on galaxy\n(VV 340 North) that dominates the long-wavelength emission from the system and\nwhich hosts a buried AGN, and a face-on starburst (VV 340 South) that dominates\nthe short-wavelength emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2009 22:11:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2009 21:18:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

In this theory, the gravitational field\nof spinning black holes is described by a modified Kerr geometry whose\nmultipole moments deviate from the Kerr ones only at the fourth multipole, l =\n4. We investigate possible signatures of this theory in the gravitational wave\nemission produced in the inspiral of stellar compact objects into massive black\nholes, both for intermediate- and extreme-mass ratios. We use the\nsemi-relativistic approximation, where the trajectories are geodesics of the\nmassive black hole geometry and the gravitational waveforms are obtained from a\nmultipolar decomposition of the radiative field. The main CS corrections to the\nwaveforms arise from modifications to the geodesic trajectories, due to changes\nto the massive black hole geometry, and manifest themselves as an accumulating\ndephasing relative to the general relativistic case. We also explore the\npropagation and the stress-energy tensor of gravitational waves in this theory.\nWe find that, although this tensor has the same form as in General Relativity,\nthe energy and angular momentum balance laws are indeed modified through the\nstress-energy tensor of the CS scalar field. These balance laws could be used\nto describe the inspiral through adiabatic changes in the orbital parameters,\nwhich in turn would enhance the dephasing effect.

The star\nformation efficiency per free-fall time (SFE_ff) of the high-mass SF clump is\nlow, ~0.04. This occurs because the clump is accreting mass at a high rate, not\nbecause its specific SFR (SSFR) is low. This implies that a low value of the\nSFE_ff does not necessarily imply a low SSFR, but may rather indicate a large\ngas accretion rate. We suggest that a globally low SSFR at the GMC level can be\nattained even if local star forming sites have much larger values of the SSFR\nif star formation is a spatially intermittent process, so that most of the mass\nin a GMC is not participating of the SF process at any given time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2009 00:54:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2009 01:10:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-07"}

To overcome this problem,\nanother state of beliefs, called \\emph{near-ignorance}, has been proposed.\nNear-ignorance resembles ignorance very closely, by satisfying some principles\nthat can arguably be regarded as necessary in a state of ignorance, and allows\nlearning to take place. What this paper does, is to provide new and substantial\nevidence that also near-ignorance cannot be really regarded as a way out of the\nproblem of starting statistical inference in conditions of very weak beliefs.\nThe key to this result is focusing on a setting characterized by a variable of\ninterest that is \\emph{latent}.

With specific fluorine distribution pattern,\nzero-dimensional and one-dimensional NFE states can be obtained. We have also\nstudied the chemical modification with -OH or -NH$_2$ group. Carbon seems to be\ntoo small to accommodate big functional groups on its graphane skeleton with a\nhigh concentration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2009 06:41:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-24"}

This result was subsequently\ngeneralized in [p. 391, Problem 10(c) 2] and [4] to broadcast channels with a\ncommon message. However the latter region is not computable (except in certain\nspecial cases) as no bounds on the cardinality of its auxiliary random\nvariables exist. Nor is it even clear that the inner bound is a closed set. The\nmain obstacle in proving cardinality bounds is the fact that the traditional\nuse of the Carath\\'{e}odory theorem, the main known tool for proving\ncardinality bounds, does not yield a finite cardinality result. One of the main\ncontributions of this paper is the introduction of a new tool based on an\nidentity that relates the second derivative of the Shannon entropy of a\ndiscrete random variable (under a certain perturbation) to the corresponding\nFisher information. In order to go beyond the traditional Carath\\'{e}odory type\narguments, we identify certain properties that the auxiliary random variables\ncorresponding to the extreme points of the inner bound need to satisfy. These\nproperties are then used to establish cardinality bounds on the auxiliary\nrandom variables of the inner bound, thereby proving the computability of the\nregion, and its closedness.\n  Lastly, we establish a conjecture of \\cite{NairZizhou} that Marton's inner\nbound and the recent outer bound of Nair and El Gamal do not match in general.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2009 06:50:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2009 04:09:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 28 May 2011 12:26:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-31"}

Because of low\nluminosity of M dwarfs, habitable zones (HZs) are located in inner regions. In\nthe close-in HZ, type-I migration and the orbital decay induced by eccentricity\ndamping are efficient according to the high disk gas density in the small\norbital radii. In the case of full efficiency of type-I migration predicted by\nthe linear theory, we found that protoplanets that migrate to the vicinity of\nthe host star undergo close scatterings and collisions, and 4 to 6 planets\neventually remain in mutual mean motion resonances and their orbits have small\neccentricities and they are stable both before and after disk gas decays. In\nthe case of slow migration, the resonant capture is so efficient that\ndensely-packed ~ 40 small protoplanets remain in mutual mean motion resonances.\nIn this case, they start orbit crossing, after the disk gas decays and\neccentricity damping due to tidal interaction with gas is no more effective.\nThrough merging of the protoplanets, several planets in widely-separated\nnon-resonant orbits with relatively large eccentricities are formed. Thus, the\nfinal orbital configurations of the terrestrial planets around M dwarfs\nsensitively depend on strength of type-I migration. We also found that large\namount of water-ice is delivered by type-I migration from outer regions and\nfinal planets near the inner disk edge around M dwarfs are generally abundant\nin water-ice except for the innermost one that is shielded by the outer\nplanets, unless type-I migration speed is reduced by a factor of more than 100\nfrom that predicted by the linear theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2009 07:07:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

Recently a\nsubstantial progress was achieved in enhancing the time, which a solid-state\nqubit demonstrates a coherent dynamics. This progress is based mostly on a\nsuccessful isolation of the qubits from external decoherence sources. Under\nthese conditions the material-inherent sources of noise start to play a crucial\nrole. In most cases the noise that quantum device demonstrate has 1/f spectrum.\nThis suggests that the environment that destroys the phase coherence of the\nqubit can be thought of as a system of two-state fluctuators, which experience\nrandom hops between their states. In this short review we discuss the current\nstate of the theory of the decoherence due to the qubit interaction with the\nfluctuators. We describe the effect of such an environment on different\nprotocols of the qubit manipulations - free induction and echo signal. It turns\nout that in many important cases the noise produced by the fluctuators is\nnon-Gaussian. Consequently the results of the interaction of the qubit with the\nfluctuators are not determined by the pair correlation function only.\n  We describe the effect of the fluctuators using so-called spin-fluctuator\nmodel. Being quite realistic this model allows one to evaluate the qubit\ndynamics in the presence of one fluctuator exactly. This solution is found, and\nits features, including non-Gaussian effects are analyzed in details. We extend\nthis consideration for the systems of large number of fluctuators, which\ninteract with the qubit and lead to the 1/f noise. We discuss existing\nexperiments on the Josephson qubit manipulation and try to identify\nnon-Gaussian behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2009 12:39:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We investigate the conflict between these two\nprocesses based on two-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic (RHD) simulation data\nand construct a simplified (radially) one-dimensional model. Mass loss due to\noutflow, which is not considered in the slim-disk model, will reduce surface\ndensity of the flow, and if very significant, it will totally suppress photon\ntrapping effects. If the photon trapping is very significant, conversely,\noutflow will be suppressed because radiation pressure force will be reduced. To\nsee what actually occurs, we examine the RHD simulation data and evaluate the\naccretion rate and outflow rate as functions of radius. We find that the former\nmonotonically decreases, while the latter increases, as the radius decreases.\nHowever, the former is kept constant at small radii, inside several\nSchwarzschild radii, since the outflow is suppressed by the photon trapping\neffects. To understand the conflict between the photon trapping and outflow in\na simpler way, we model the radial distribution of the accretion rate from the\nsimulation data and build up a new (radially) one-dimensional model, which is\nsimilar to the slim-disk model but incorporates the mass loss effects due to\nthe outflow. We find that the surface density (and, hence, the optical depth)\nis much reduced even inside the trapping radius, compared with the case without\noutflow, whereas the effective temperature distribution hardly changes. That\nis, the emergent spectra do not sensitively depend on the amount of mass\noutflow.

Twelve two-center\nLennard-Jones plus point dipole and point quadrupole model fluids (2CLJDQ) are\nstudied for different reduced dipolar moments mu^{*2}=6,12, reduced quadrupolar\nmoments Q^{*2}=2,4 and reduced elongations L^*=0, 0.505,1. Temperatures cover a\nwide range from about 55% to about 95% of the critical temperature of each\nfluid. The NpT + test particle method is used for the calculation of vapor\npressure, saturated densities and saturated enthalpies.Critical data and the\nacentric factor are obtained from fits to the simulation data.On the basis of\nthis data, an EOS contribution for the dipole-quadrupole cross-interactions of\nnon-spherical molecules is developed. The expression is based on a third-order\nperturbation theory and the model constants are adjusted to the present 2CLJDQ\nsimulation results. When applied to mixtures, the model is found to be in\nexcellent agreement to results from simulation and experiment. The new EOS\ncontribution is also compatible with segment-based EOS, like the various forms\nof the Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (SAFT) EOS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2009 15:12:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-30"}

This intermediate\nconvective zone (ICZ) plays an essential role in governing which g-modes are\nexcited. Indeed a strong radiative damping occurs in the high density radiative\ncore but the ICZ acts as a barrier preventing the propagation of some g-modes\ninto the core. These g-modes can thus be excited in supergiant stars by the\nkappa-mechanism in the superficial layers due to the opacity bump of iron, at\nlog T=5.2. However massive stars are submitted to various complex phenomena\nsuch as rotation, magnetic fields, semiconvection, mass loss, overshooting.\nEach of these phenomena exerts a significant effect on the evolution and some\nof them could prevent the onset of the convective zone. We develop a numerical\nmethod which allows us to select the reflected, thus the potentially excited,\nmodes only. We study different cases in order to show that mass loss and\novershooting, in a large enough amount, reduce the extent of the ICZ and are\nunfavourable to the excitation of g-modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2009 15:36:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The goal is to present an analysis based on minimal sets of\nassumptions and extrapolations with respect to locally testable or measurable\nquantities. We discuss the differences between the spatial and spectral\nfeatures for the DM-induced components (with an extended, possibly spherical,\nsource function) and those for the standard CR contribution (with sources\nconfined within the stellar disc), and propose to focus on intermediate and\nlarge latitudes. We address the dependence of the signal to background ratio on\nthe model adopted to describe the propagation of charged CRs in the Galaxy, and\nfind that, in general, the DM-induced signal can be detected by the Fermi\nGamma-ray Space Telescope at energies above 100 GeV. An observational result in\nagreement with the prediction from standard CR components only, would imply\nvery strong constraints on the DM interpretation of the PAMELA excess. On the\nother hand, if an excess in the diffuse emission above 100 GeV is identified,\nthe angular profile for such emission would allow for a clean disentanglement\nbetween the DM interpretation and astrophysical explanations proposed for the\nPAMELA excess. We also compare to the radiative diffuse emission at lower\nfrequencies, sketching in particular the detection prospects at infrared\nfrequencies with the Planck satellite.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2009 15:51:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2009 15:26:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-01"}
