Both approaches agree for stronger\nfields, but there are apparent discrepancies for weaker fields that can be\nexplained by the influence of dynamo-generated magnetic fields on the scale of\nthe domain that are referred to as meso-scale magnetic fields. Examples are\ndiscussed where these meso-scale fields can lead to both drastically\noverestimated and underestimated values of alpha compared with the kinematic\ncase. It is demonstrated that the kinematic value can be recovered by resetting\nthe fluctuating magnetic field to zero in regular time intervals.

We take an arbitrary variable as the\nreference and consider the optimal (minimum variance) linear unbiased estimate\nof the remaining variables.\n  We investigate how the error in the optimal linear unbiased estimate of a\nnode variable grows with the distance of the node to the reference node. We\nestablish a classification of graphs, namely, dense or sparse in Rd,1<= d <=3,\nthat determines how the linear unbiased optimal estimation error of a node\ngrows with its distance from the reference node. In particular, if a graph is\ndense in 1,2, or 3D, then a node variable's estimation error is upper bounded\nby a linear, logarithmic, or bounded function of distance from the reference,\nrespectively. Corresponding lower bounds are obtained if the graph is sparse in\n1, 2 and 3D.\n  Our results also show that naive measures of graph density, such as node\ndegree, are inadequate predictors of the estimation error.

This is by\nfar the largest number of 21-cm detections from any single survey of\nintervening absorbers. Prior to our survey no intervening 21-cm system was\nknown in the above redshift range and only one system was known in the redshift\nrange 0.7<z<1.5. We discuss the relation between the detectability of 21-cm\nabsorption and various properties of UV absorption lines. We show that if MgII\nsystems are selected with the following criteria, MgII doublet ratio <1.3 and\nW_r(MgI)/W_r(MgII)>0.3, then a detection rate of 21-cm absorption up to 90% can\nbe achieved. We estimate n_{21}, the number per unit redshift of 21-cm\nabsorbers with W_r(Mg(II)>W_o and integrated optical depth Tau_{21}>Tau_o and\nshow that n_{21} decreases with increasing redshift. In particular, for W_o=1.0\n\\AA and Tau_o>0.3 km\\s, n_{21} falls by a factor 4 from <z>=0.5 to <z>=1.3. The\nevolution seems to be stronger for stronger MgII systems. Using a subsample of\nsystems for which high frequency VLBA images are available, we show that the\neffect is not related to the structure of the background radio sources and is\nmost probably due to the evolution of the cold neutral medium filling factor in\nMgII systems.

Physically this result appears due to the density of\nstates suppression by superconductive fluctuations near the Fermi level. It is\ninteresting that the other correction, which accounts for the\nMaki-Thompson-type interaction of fluctuations, is positive and exhibits strong\npower law, which dominates the logarithmic term in the immediate vicinity of\nthe critical temperature. An interplay between these two contributions\ndetermines the zero-bias anomaly in fluctuating superconductors. This paper is\ndevoted to the fate of such interaction corrections in the ballistic\nsuperconductors. It turns out that ballistic dynamic fluctuations perturb\nsingle-particle density of states near the Fermi level at the energy scale\nwhich is different from that in the diffusive case. As the consequence,\nfluctuation region becomes much broader.

The system\nMg_{1-x}Fe_xO is believed to be the second most abundant mineral in the Earth's\nlower mantle.\n  We confirm the experimentally found increase of the critical pressure upon\niron concentration. Our calculations using standard GGA for a fixed Fe\nconcentration show that different arrangements of Fe atoms can remarkably shift\nthe transition pressure of the high spin (HS) to low spin (LS) transition. This\ncould explain the experimentally found broad transition regions. Our results\nindicate that the HS-LS transition in Mg$_{1-x}Fe_xO is first order. We find\nthat SIC-LSD fails to predict the divalent Fe configuration as the lowest\nenergy configuration and discuss possible reasons for it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Apr 2009 09:38:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-21"}

This\npaper studies the impact of ignoring data truncation on the 0.999 quantile of\nthe annual loss distribution for operational risk for a broad range of\ndistribution parameters and truncation levels. Loss frequency and severity are\nmodelled by the Poisson and Lognormal distributions respectively. Two cases of\nignoring data truncation are studied: the \"naive model\" - fitting a Lognormal\ndistribution with support on a positive semi-infinite interval, and \"shifted\nmodel\" - fitting a Lognormal distribution shifted to the truncation level. For\nall practical cases, the \"naive model\" leads to underestimation (that can be\nsevere) of the 0.999 quantile. The \"shifted model\" overestimates the 0.999\nquantile except some cases of small underestimation for large truncation\nlevels. Conservative estimation of capital charge is usually acceptable and the\nuse of the \"shifted model\" can be justified while the \"naive model\" should not\nbe allowed. However, if parameter uncertainty is taken into account (in\npractice it is often ignored), the \"shifted model\" can lead to considerable\nunderestimation of capital charge.

However, this assumption can be violated\nin practice. In this paper, we analyze inter-session network coding in a wired\nnetwork using game theory. We assume selfish users acting strategically to\nmaximize their own utility, leading to a resource allocation game among users.\nIn particular, we study the well-known butterfly network topology where a\nbottleneck link is shared by several network coding and routing flows. We prove\nthe existence of a Nash equilibrium for a wide range of utility functions. We\nshow that the number of Nash equilibria can be large (even infinite) for\ncertain choices of system parameters. This is in sharp contrast to a similar\ngame setting with traditional packet forwarding where the Nash equilibrium is\nalways unique. We then characterize the worst-case efficiency bounds, i.e., the\nPrice-of-Anarchy (PoA), compared to an optimal and cooperative network design.\nWe show that by using a novel discriminatory pricing scheme which charges\nencoded and forwarded packets differently, we can improve the PoA. However,\nregardless of the discriminatory pricing scheme being used, the PoA is still\nworse than for the case when network coding is not applied. This implies that,\nalthough inter-session network coding can improve performance compared to\nordinary routing, it is significantly more sensitive to users' strategic\nbehaviour. For example, in a butterfly network where the side links have zero\ncost, the efficiency can be as low as 25%. If the side links have non-zero\ncost, then the efficiency can further reduce to only 20%. These results\ngeneralize the well-known result of guaranteed 67% worst-case efficiency for\ntraditional packet forwarding networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Apr 2009 14:47:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}
