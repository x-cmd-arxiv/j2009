The computational cost of\nsuch simulation is orders of magnitude lower than in the direct approach and a\ncomprehensive analysis of multiple and plural scattering effects becomes\npossible. We use the new method for two purposes. First, the accuracy of the\napproximate approaches, developed mainly for ion-beam structural analysis, is\nverified. Second, the possibility to reproduce a wide class of experimental\nconditions is used to analyze some basic features of ion-solid collisions: the\nrole of double violent collisions in low-energy ion scattering; the origin of\nthe \"surface peak\" in scattering from amorphous samples; the low-energy tail in\nthe energy spectra of scattered medium-energy ions due to plural scattering;\nthe degradation of blocking patterns in 2D angular distributions with\nincreasing depth of scattering.

On the one hand, approaches such as dynamic\nBayesian networks (DBNs) provide a formal probabilistic basis to model\nrelationships between time-indexed random variables but these models are\nintractable to learn in the general case. On the other, algorithms such as\nfrequent episode mining are scalable to large datasets but do not exhibit the\nrigorous probabilistic interpretations that are the mainstay of the graphical\nmodels literature.\n  Results: We present a unification of these two seemingly diverse threads of\nresearch, by demonstrating how dynamic (discrete) Bayesian networks can be\ninferred from the results of frequent episode mining. This helps bridge the\nmodeling emphasis of the former with the counting emphasis of the latter.\nFirst, we show how, under reasonable assumptions on data characteristics and on\ninfluences of random variables, the optimal DBN structure can be computed using\na greedy, local, algorithm. Next, we connect the optimality of the DBN\nstructure with the notion of fixed-delay episodes and their counts of distinct\noccurrences. Finally, to demonstrate the practical feasibility of our approach,\nwe focus on a specific (but broadly applicable) class of networks, called\nexcitatory networks, and show how the search for the optimal DBN structure can\nbe conducted using just information from frequent episodes.

Most clusters contained multiple X-ray peaks, yielding 17\ntotal mass concentrations. In this paper, we constrain the masses of these\nX-ray sources with weak lensing, using photometric redshifts from the full set\nof BVRz' imaging to properly weight background galaxies according to their\nlensing distance ratios. We fit both NFW and singular isothermal sphere\nprofiles, and find that the results are insensitive to the assumed profile.

The inferred velocity dispersions for the extended X-ray\nsources range from 250-800 km/s, with the exception of one source for which no\nlensing signal was found. This work further establishes shear selection as a\nviable technique for finding clusters, but also highlights some unresolved\nissues such as determination of the mass profile center without biasing the\nmass estimate, and fully accounting for line-of-sight projections.

The path goes through a strongly interacting region. We\nalso find the field theory interpretation of this phenomenon. There is a second\norder phase transition between the two phases in the free theory which can be\navoided by going through the strongly interacting region. We show that this\ntransition is in the 2D Ising universality class, where a first order phase\ntransition line, terminating at a second order transition, can be avoided by\ngoing through the analogue of a high temperature paramagnetic phase. In fact,\nwe construct the full phase diagram of the system as a function of the thermal\noperator (i.e. the mass term that tunes between the two phases in the free\ntheory) and two quartic operators, obtaining a first order Peierls transition\nregion, a second order transition region, and a region with no transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2009 20:20:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2009 19:10:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2009 23:53:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

Distinct solutions\ncorrespond to different sectors, phases, of the theory, which are nothing but\ndistinct foliations of the vacuum manifold, or points in the Moduli Space (for\nall possible values of the parameters of the theory). Under this framework,\nthree different problems will be attacked: \"Mollifying QFT\", \"Topological\nTransitions and Geometric Langlands Duality\" and \"Three-dimensional Gravity and\nits Phase Transitions\".

The squared absolute value of the wave function is interpreted as\nthe probability density in the configuration space, from which the standard\nprobabilistic predictions of QFT can be recovered.

In particular, when the conditional wave function\nassociated with a quantum measurement ceases to depend on one of the spacetime\ncoordinates, then the 4-velocity of the corresponding particle vanishes,\ndescribing a trajectory that stops at a particular point in spacetime.

The evolution of both heavy and light particle pairs is\nanalysed at varying the particle Stokes number and the fluid-to-particle\ndensity ratio. For heavy particles, it is found that turbulent dispersion is\nschematically governed by two temporal regimes. The first is dominated by the\npresence, at large Stokes numbers, of small-scale caustics in the particle\nvelocity statistics, and it lasts until heavy particle velocities have relaxed\ntowards the underlying flow velocities. At such large scales, a second regime\nstarts where heavy particles separate as tracers particles would do. As a\nconsequence, at increasing inertia, a larger transient stage is observed, and\nthe Richardson diffusion of simple tracers is recovered only at large times and\nlarge scales. These features also arise from a statistical closure of the\nequation of motion for heavy particle separation that is proposed, and which is\nsupported by the numerical results. In the case of light particles with high\ndensity ratios, strong small-scale clustering leads to a considerable fraction\nof pairs that do not separate at all, although the mean separation increases\nwith time.

If the global metric improves and\neventually stabilizes, it is considered a reasonable verification of the\nsystem's stability.\n  The main contribution of this note is establishing the need for better\nexperimental frameworks and measures to assess the stability of large-scale\nadaptive cooperative systems. We show an experimental case study where the\nstability of the global performance metric can be rather deceiving, hiding an\nunderlying instability in the system that later leads to a significant drop in\nperformance. We then propose an alternative metric that relies on agents' local\npolicies and show, experimentally, that our proposed metric is more effective\n(than the traditional global performance metric) in exposing the instability of\nMARL algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2009 13:49:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-16"}

By fitting the magneto-conductance data to theory, the\nphase coherence length of electrons is determined to be tens of nanometers with\na T-1/3 dependence. Moreover, as the electron density is increased by a gate\nvoltage, the magneto-conductance shows a possible signature of suppression of\nweak localization in multiple 1D subbands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2009 15:26:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}
