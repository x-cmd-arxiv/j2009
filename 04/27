If we limit ourselves to classical communication, this task\nrequires either assumptions on the computational power of the players or it\nrequires them to send messages to each other with sufficient simultaneity to\nforce their complete independence. Without such assumptions, all classical\nprotocols are so that one dishonest player has complete control over the\noutcome. If we use quantum communication, on the other hand, protocols have\nbeen introduced that limit the maximal bias that dishonest players can produce.\nHowever, those protocols would be very difficult to implement in practice\nbecause they are susceptible to realistic losses on the quantum channel between\nthe players or in their quantum memory and measurement apparatus. In this\npaper, we introduce a novel quantum protocol and we prove that it is completely\nimpervious to loss. The protocol is fair in the sense that either player has\nthe same probability of success in cheating attempts at biasing the outcome of\nthe coin flip. We also give explicit and optimal cheating strategies for both\nplayers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2009 09:48:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 May 2009 19:54:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

Lower metallicity systems are found to\nhave redder [3.6] - [4.5] colors on average, but with considerable scatter. The\nobserved range in [3.6] - [4.5] color is too large to be accounted for solely\nby variations in stellar colors due to age or metallicity differences;\ninterstellar effects must contribute as well. For the reddest systems, the 4.5\nmicron luminosity may not be a good tracer of stellar mass. We identify three\nfactors that redden this color in dwarfs. First, in some systems, strong\nBr-alpha emission contributes significantly to the 4.5 micron emission. Second,\nin some cases high optical depths lead to strong reddening of the starlight in\nthe Spitzer bands. Third, in some galaxies, the nebular continuum dominates the\n4.5 micron flux, and in extreme cases, the 3.6 micron flux as well. The harder\nUV radiation fields in lower metallicity systems produce both more gaseous\ncontinuum in the infrared and more Br-alpha per star formation rate.

Traditionally, RBNs are interconnected\nrandomly and without considering any spatial extension and arrangement of the\nlinks and nodes.

For the same initial\nconditions, such as the fixed accretion rate, it is found that the intrinsic\nsize and radiation intensity of the images become larger, but the images become\nmore compact in the inner region, while the size of the black hole shadow\ndecreases with the increase of the black hole spin. With the increase of the\ninclination angles, the shapes of the black hole shadows change and become\nsmaller, even disappear at all due to the obscuration by the thick disks. For\nmedian inclination angles, the radial velocity observed at infinity is larger\nbecause of both the rotation and radial motion of the fluid in the disk, which\nresults in the luminous part of the images is much brighter. For larger\ninclination angles, such as the disk is edge on, the emission becomes dimmer at\nlonger observational wavelengths (such as at 7.0mm and 3.5mm wavelengths), or\nbrighter at shorter observational wavelengths (such as at 1.3 mm wavelength)\nthan that of the face on case, except for the high spin and high inclination\nimages.

The influence on the inhomogeneity of the solar rotation and limb\ndarkening has been considered previously (Brookes et al. 1978a) and is well\nunderstood.

The intensity of light observed from a particular\nregion on the solar disc is dependent on the distance between that region on\nthe image of the solar disc formed in the instrument and the detector. The\nmajority of BiSON instruments have two detectors positioned on opposite sides\nof the image of the solar disc and the observations made by each detector are\nweighted towards differing regions of the disc. Therefore the visibility and\namplitudes of the solar oscillations and the realization of the solar noise\nobserved by each detector will differ. We find that the modelled bias is\nsensitive to many different parameters such as the width of solar absorption\nlines, the strength of the magnetic field in the resonant scattering\nspectrometer, the orientation of the Sun's rotation axis, the size of the image\nobserved by the instrument and the optical depth in the vapour cell.

The positions of radio-spike\nsources and coronal X-ray sources are determined and analyzed in a\nwell-observed limb event. Radio spikes are identified in observations from the\nPhoenix-2 spectrometer. Data from the Nan\\c{c}ay radioheliograph are used to\ndetermine the position of the radio spikes. RHESSI images in soft and hard\nX-ray wavelengths are used to determine the X-ray flare geometry. Those\nobservations are complemented by images from GOES/SXI. We find that decimetric\nspikes do not originate from coronal X-ray flare sources contrary to previous\nexpectations. However, the observations suggest a causal link between the\ncoronal X-ray source, related to the major energy release site, and\nsimultaneous activity in the higher corona.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2009 12:25:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

This reveals\nthat the per-node backoff process is heavy-tailed in the strict sense for\n$\\gamma>1/m^2$, and paves the way for the following unifying result.\n  The state-of-the-art theory on the superposition of the heavy-tailed\nprocesses is applied to establish a dichotomy exhibited by the aggregate\nbackoff process, putting emphasis on the importance of time-scale on which we\nview the backoff processes. While the aggregation on normal time-scales leads\nto a Poisson process, it is approximated by a new limiting process possessing\nlong-range dependence (LRD) on coarse time-scales.

In the UV limit, the scalar\nperturbation in the Ho\\v{r}ava theory is naturally scale-invariant, ignoring\nthe details of the expansion of the Universe. One may thus relax the\nexponential inflation and the slow-roll conditions for the inflaton field. As a\nresult, it is possible that the primordial non-gaussianities, which are\n``slow-roll suppressed'' in the standard scenarios, become large. We calculate\nthe non-gaussianities from the bispectrum of the perturbation and find that the\nequilateral-type non-gaussianity is of the order of unity, while the local-type\nnon-gaussianity remains small, as in the usual single-field slow-roll inflation\nmodel in general relativity.
