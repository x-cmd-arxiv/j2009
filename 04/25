If the\nsource emission is anisotropic, the images may differ from conventional lensing\npredictions (which assume isotropy). To identify scales on which source\nanisotropy may be important, we study the angle delta between the light rays\nemerging from the source, for different lensing configurations. If the lens has\na power law profile M propto R^gamma, the angle delta initially increases with\nlens redshift and then either diverges (for a steep profile gamma<1), remains\nconstant (for an isothermal profile gamma=1), or vanishes (for a shallow\nprofile gamma>1) as zl approaches zs. The scaling with lens mass is roughly\ndelta propto M^(1/(2-gamma)). The results for an NFW profile are qualitatively\nsimilar to those for a shallow power law, with delta peaking at about half the\nredshift of the source (not half the distance).

It is also, by a wide margin, the highest mass system with\n>27 Jupiters of planetary mass past 25 AU. This is a remarkable system with no\nanalogue with any other known planetary system. In the first part of this paper\nwe investigate the nature of two faint objects imaged near the system. These\nobjects are considerably fainter (H=20.4, and 21.6 mag) and more distant\n(projected separations of 612, and 534 AU) than the three known planetary\ncompanions b, c, and d (68-24 AU). It is possible that these two objects could\nbe lower mass planets (of mass ~5 and ~3 Jupiters) that have been scattered to\nwider orbits. We make the first direct comparison of newly reduced archival\nGemini adaptive optics images to archival HST/NICMOS images. With nearly a\ndecade between these epochs we can accurately assess the proper motion nature\nof each candidate companion. We find that both objects are unbound to HR 8799\nand are background. We estimate that HR 8799 has no companions of H<22 from\n~5-15 arcsec. Any scattered giant planets in the HR 8799 system are >600 AU or\nless than 3 Jupiters in mass. In the second part of this paper we carry out a\nsearch for wider common proper motion objects. While we identify no bound\ncompanions to HR 8799, our search yields 16 objects within 1 degree in the\nNOMAD catalog and POSS DSS images with similar (+/-20 mas/yr) proper motions to\nHR 8799, three of which warrant follow-up observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Apr 2009 04:40:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-06"}

Our results indicate that the former distribution decays as a\npower-law with exponent 1 for all connectivities $K>1$ in the infinite system\nsize limit. In contrast, the latter distribution decays as a power law only for\nK=2. This is because the mean basin size grows linearly with the attractor\ncycle length for $K>2$, and is statistically independent of the cycle length\nfor K=2. We also find that the histograms of basin sizes are strongly peaked at\ninteger multiples of powers of two for $K<3$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 2009 21:35:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-28"}

This approach is used to analyze the weakly\nturbulent state of spiral defect chaos in experiments on Rayleigh-Benard\nconvection. Different attractors of spiral defect chaos are distinguished by\ntheir homology. The technique reveals pattern asymmetries that are not revealed\nusing statistical measures. In addition we observe global stochastic ergodicity\nfor system parameter values where locally chaotic dynamics has been observed\npreviously.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Apr 2009 09:32:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-28"}

For this purpose, we follow the evolution of primordial chemistry\nin the presence of magnetic fields in the post-recombination universe until the\nformation of the first virialized halos. From the point of virialization, we\nfollow the protostellar collapse up to densities of $\\sim10^{12}$ cm$^{-3}$ in\na one-zone model. In the intergalactic medium (IGM), comoving field strengths\nof $\\gtrsim0.1$ nG lead to Jeans masses of $10^8 M_\\odot$ or more and thus\ndelay gravitational collapse in the first halos until they are sufficiently\nmassive. During protostellar collapse, we find that the temperature minimum at\ndensities of $\\sim10^3$ cm$^{-3}$ does not change significantly, such that the\ncharacteristic mass scale for fragmentation is not affected. However, we find a\nsignificant temperature increase at higher densities for comoving field\nstrengths of $\\gtrsim0.1$ nG. This may delay gravitational collapse, in\nparticular at densities of $\\sim10^9$ cm$^{-3}$, where the proton abundance\ndrops rapidly and the main contribution to the ambipolar diffusion resistivity\nis due to collisions with Li$^+$. After the formation of the protostar, the\nincreased gas temperatures may enhance the protostellar accretion rate. Our\nmodel confirms that initial weak magnetic fields may be amplified considerably\nduring gravitational collapse and become dynamically relevant. For instance, a\ncomoving field strength above $10^{-5}$ nG will be amplified above the critical\nvalue for the onset of jets which can magnetize the IGM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Apr 2009 08:48:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Aug 2009 09:38:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-28"}

Below ~300 MHz, spatially variant\nrefractions and propagation delays of radio waves traveling through the\nionosphere cause phase rotations that can vary significantly with time, viewing\ndirection and antenna location. In this article we present a description and\nfirst results of SPAM (Source Peeling and Atmospheric Modeling), a new\ncalibration method that attempts to iteratively solve and correct for\nionospheric phase errors. To model the ionosphere, we construct a time-variant,\n2-dimensional phase screen at fixed height above the Earth's surface. Spatial\nvariations are described by a truncated set of discrete Karhunen-Loeve base\nfunctions, optimized for an assumed power-law spectral density of free\nelectrons density fluctuations, and a given configuration of calibrator sources\nand antenna locations. The model is constrained using antenna-based gain phases\nfrom individual self-calibrations on the available bright sources in the\nfield-of-view. Application of SPAM on three test cases, a simulated visibility\ndata set and two selected 74 MHz VLA data sets, yields significant improvements\nin image background noise (5-75 percent reduction) and source peak fluxes (up\nto 25 percent increase) as compared to the existing self-calibration and\nfield-based calibration methods, which indicates a significant improvement in\nionospheric phase calibration accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Apr 2009 10:58:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 May 2009 19:18:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}
