A basic\nrequirement for the integral models, or equivalently for the local models, is\nthat they be flat. In the case of local models for even orthogonal groups,\nGenestier observed that the original definition of the local model does not\nyield a flat scheme. In a recent article, Pappas and Rapoport introduced a new\ncondition to the moduli problem defining the local model, the so-called spin\ncondition, and conjectured that the resulting \"spin\" local model is flat. We\nprove a weak form of their conjecture in the split, Iwahori case, namely that\nthe spin local model is topologically flat. An essential combinatorial\ningredient is the equivalence of mu-admissibility and mu-permissibility for two\nminuscule cocharacters mu in root systems of type D.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2009 19:37:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 2010 17:57:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-15"}

Late-time optical spectra are also presented. For the\nperiod 300-795 days past explosion, we argue that the spectral energy\ndistribution of SN 2004et comprises (a) a hot component due to emission from\noptically thick gas, as well as free-bound radiation, (b) a warm component due\nto newly formed, radioactively heated dust in the ejecta, and (c) a cold\ncomponent due to an IR echo from the interstellar-medium dust of the host\ngalaxy, NGC 6946. There may also have been a small contribution to the IR SED\ndue to free-free emission from ionised gas in the ejecta. We reveal the\nfirst-ever spectroscopic evidence for silicate dust formed in the ejecta of a\nsupernova. This is supported by our detection of a large, but progressively\ndeclining, mass of SiO. However, we conclude that the mass of directly detected\nejecta dust grew to no more than a few times 10^(-4)Msun. We also provide\nevidence that the ejecta dust formed in comoving clumps of fixed size. We argue\nthat, after about two years past explosion, the appearance of wide, box-shaped\noptical line profiles was due to the impact of the ejecta on the progenitor\ncircumstellar medium and that the subsequent formation of a cool, dense shell\nwas responsible for a later rise in the MIR flux. This study demonstrates the\nrich, multi-faceted ways in which a typical core-collapse supernova and its\nprogenitor can produce and/or interact with dust grains. The work presented\nhere adds to the growing number of studies which do not support the contention\nthat SNe are responsible for the large mass of observed dust in high-redshift\ngalaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2009 17:43:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2009 11:47:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-02"}

Instead, the effect\nof electron-doping is to reduce the c-axis exchange coupling in BaFe$_2$As$_2$\nand induce quasi two-dimensional spin excitations.

In clean crystals of Ba1-xKxFe2As2, as well as in PrFeAsO1-y\ncrystals, the penetration depth shows flat temperature dependence at low\ntemperatures, indicating that the superconducting gap opens all over the Fermi\nsurface. The temperature dependence of superfluid density in both systems is\nmost consistent with the existence of two different gaps. In Ba1-xKxFe2As2, we\nfind that the superfluid density is sensitive to degrees of disorder inherent\nin the crystals, implying unconventional impurity effect. We also determine the\nlower critical field $H_{c1}$ in PrFeAsO1-y by using an array of micro-Hall\nprobes. The temperature dependence of $H_{c1}$ saturates at low temperatures,\nfully consistent with the superfluid density determined by microwave\nmeasurements. The anisotropy of $H_{c1}$ has a weak temperature dependence with\nsmaller values than the anisotropy of upper critical fields at low\ntemperatures, which further supports the multi-gap superconductivity in\nFe-arsenide systems. The quasiparticle conductivity shows an enhancement in the\nsuperconducting state, which suggests the reduction of quasiparticle scattering\nrate due to the gap formation below $T_c$.

We start by studying the\nrecently proposed quadratic Lyapunov function based algorithms (QLA). We show\nthat for every stochastic problem, there is a corresponding\n\\emph{deterministic} problem, whose dual optimal solution \"exponentially\nattracts\" the network backlog process under QLA. In particular, the probability\nthat the backlog vector under QLA deviates from the attractor is exponentially\ndecreasing in their Euclidean distance. This not only helps to explain how QLA\nachieves the desired performance but also suggests that one can roughly\n\"subtract out\" a Lagrange multiplier from the system induced by QLA. We thus\ndevelop a family of \\emph{Fast Quadratic Lyapunov based Algorithms} (FQLA) that\nachieve an $[O(1/V), O(\\log^2(V))]$ performance-delay tradeoff for problems\nwith a discrete set of action options, and achieve a square-root tradeoff for\ncontinuous problems. This is similar to the optimal performance-delay tradeoffs\nachieved in prior work by Neely (2007) via drift-steering methods, and shows\nthat QLA algorithms can also be used to approach such performance.\n  These results highlight the \"network gravity\" role of Lagrange Multipliers in\nnetwork scheduling. This role can be viewed as the counterpart of the \"shadow\nprice\" role of Lagrange Multipliers in flow regulation for classic flow-based\nnetwork problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 2009 04:15:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-27"}

This is due to\nseveral reasons, all linked to the fact that because of the smallness of the\nelectromagnetic coupling alpha, the photon does not substantially interact with\nthe medium and is expected to escape unmodified. Thus, a high P_T photon\nindicates a hard process in the collision independent of the position of the\nhard vertex. In contrast, there may not be a clear signal for a hard process\ninvolving strongly interacting partons if the production vertex is deep in the\nmedium as both partons undergo substantial final state interaction.

If we find only\nsingle Higgs particle at the LHC and also observe the top Yukawa deviation, our\nscenario becomes a realistic candidate beyond the standard model. The Yukawa\ndeviation comes from the fact that the wave function profile of the free\nphysical Higgs field can become different from that of the vacuum expectation\nvalue, due to the presence of the brane-localized Higgs potentials.

The other argues these materials are strongly or at least moderately\ncorrelated, the electrons are considerably localized and close to a\nMott-Hubbard transition, with the local magnetic moments interacting via\nshort-range superexchange. In this paper we argue that neither picture is fully\ncorrect. The systems are moderately correlated, but with correlations driven by\nHund's rule coupling rather than by the on-site Hubbard repulsion.

All charge, wherever it\nexists, experiences perpetual interaction with charge elsewhere and so can only\nexist as non-trivial current. It follows that the notion of the electrostatic\nscalar potential is a pragmatic idealization - it is not fundamental and is\nuseful simply because, in many practical circumstances, the time scales of\ninterest are sufficiently small that charges can be considered stationary in\nappropriately chosen inertial frames. In this paper, we take the view that the\nsubsuming of the electrostatic scalar potential within classical\nelectrodynamics raises issues of fundamental principle and consider the\nquestion of whether it is possible to have a relativistic electrodynamics sans\nthe electrostatic scalar potential - that is, expressed purely in terms of some\nform of relativistic magnetic potential. Surprisingly, we find that such a\nthing can be realized in a remarkably simple way - and which is cost-free for\nordinary applications of electrodynamics. But the overall formalism has\nfundamental ramifications for our deeper understanding of electrodynamics - for\nexample, a new relativistic symmetry arises which, naturally interpreted,\nimplies that the Lorentz force must be considered as a local-action contact\nforce in which energy-momentum is locally conserved through the medium of an\nuncharged massive vector particle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 2009 13:33:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-27"}

The\nRaman spectra are well-defined and the reported spectral signature together\nwith the mode assignment sets the basis for the use of Raman scattering for the\ninvestigation of RE-scandates. The observed positions of Raman modes for DyScO3\nare for most bands in reasonable agreement with recent theoretical ab initio\npredictions of the vibrational spectrum for the same material. Further to the\nphonon signature, a luminescence signal is observed for both scandates. While\nthe luminescence is weak for DyScO3, it is very intense for GdScO3 when using a\n488 or 514 nm excitation line, which in turn inhibits full analysis of the\nphonon spectrum. We show that a meaningful phonon Raman analysis of GdScO3\nsamples can be done by using a 633 nm excitation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 2009 15:57:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
