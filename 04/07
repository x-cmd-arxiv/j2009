In the presence of an epidemic-like\nprocess of triggered shocks developing in a cascade of generations at or close\nto criticality, this \"bare\" kernel is renormalized into an even slower decaying\nresponse function $\\sim 1/t^{1-\\theta}$.

Here, we present a\ndetailed investigation of this paradoxical behavior based on a\ngeneration-by-generation decomposition of the total response function, the use\nof Laplace transforms and of \"anomalous\" scaling arguments. The paradox is\nexplained by the fact that the number of triggered generations grows\nanomalously with time at $\\sim t^\\theta$ so that the contributions of active\ngenerations up to time $t$ more than compensate the shorter memory associated\nwith a larger exponent $\\theta$. This anomalous scaling results fundamentally\nfrom the property that the expected waiting time is infinite for $0 \\leq \\theta\n\\leq 1$.

Furthermore, we showed\nthat this situation holds for the temperature itself as a thermodynamic\nquantity, namely, for each of all the thermodynamic quantities above, the\ncomputability of its value at temperature T gives a sufficient condition for T\nin (0,1) to be a fixed point on partial randomness. In this paper, we develop\nthe statistical mechanical interpretation of AIT further and pursue its formal\ncorrespondence to normal statistical mechanics. The thermodynamic quantities in\nAIT are defined based on the halting set of an optimal computer, which is a\nuniversal decoding algorithm used to define the notion of program-size\ncomplexity.

We categorize the horizontal intranetwork magnetic elements\ninto two types: one is the non-isolated element which is accompanied by the\nvertical magnetic elements during its evolution; another is the isolated\nelement which is not accompanied by the vertical magnetic elements. We identify\n446 horizontal intranetwork magnetic elements, among them 87 elements are\nisolated and 359 are non-isolated.

Constraints on the image, such as\nimage positivity and estimated projection-data tolerance, are enforced by\nprojection onto convex sets (POCS). The fact that the tomographic system is\nunder-sampled translates to the mathematical property that many widely varied\nresultant volumes may correspond to a given data tolerance. Thus the\napplication of image regularity serves two purposes: (1) reduction of the\nnumber of resultant volumes out of those allowed by fixing the data tolerance,\nfinding the minimum image TpV for fixed data tolerance, and (2) traditional\nregularization, sacrificing data fidelity for higher image regularity. The\npresent algorithm allows for this dual role of image regularity in\nunder-sampled tomography.\n  RESULTS: The proposed image-reconstruction algorithm is applied to three\nclinical DBT data sets.

Indeed, the evolution of rotation\nand activity among these stars appears to be so deterministic that their\nrotation/activity diagnostics are often utilized as estimators of stellar age.\nA primary motivation for the recent interest in improving the ages of\nsolar-type field dwarfs is in understanding the evolution of debris disks and\nplanetary systems. Reliable isochronal age-dating for field, solar-type main\nsequence stars is very difficult given the observational uncertainties and\nmulti-Gyr timescales for significant structural evolution. Observationally,\nsignificant databases of activity/rotation diagnostics exist for field\nsolar-type field dwarfs (mainly from chromospheric and X-ray activity surveys).\nBut how well can we empirically age-date solar-type field stars using\nactivity/rotation diagnostics? Here I summarize some recent results for F7-K2\ndwarfs from an analysis by Mamajek & Hillenbrand (2008), including an improved\n\"gyrochronology\" [Period(color, age)] calibration, improved chromospheric\n(R'_HK and X-ray (log Lx/Lbol) activity vs. rotation (via Rossby number)\nrelations, and a chromospheric vs. X-ray activity relation that spans four\norders of magnitude in log Lx/Lbol. Combining these relations, one can produce\npredicted chromospheric and X-ray activity isochrones as a function of color\nand age for solar type dwarfs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2009 03:20:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-16"}

It is\nargued that theories with light cosmic strings give rise to a population of\nnumerous long-lived stable loops, many of which cluster gravitationally in\ngalaxy halos along with the dark matter. Each cosmic string loop produces a\nspectrum of discrete frequencies in a nearly perfect harmonic series, a\nfundamental mode and its integer multiples. The gravitational wave signal from\ncosmic string loops in our Galactic halo is analyzed numerically and it is\nfound that the for light strings, the nearest loops typically produce strong\nsignals which stand out above the confusion noise from Galactic binaries. The\ntotal population of cosmic string loops in the Milky Way also produces a broad\nsignal that acts as a confusion noise. Both signals are enhanced by the\nclustering of loops gravitationally bound to the Galaxy, which significantly\ndecreases the average distance from the solar system to the nearest loop.\nNumerical estimates indicate that for dimensionless string tension G\\mu<\n10^{-11}, many loops are likely to be found in the Galactic halo. Lighter\nstrings, down to G\\mu=10^{-19}, are detectable by the Laser Interferometer\nSpace Antenna (LISA). For these light strings, the fundamental and low-order\nharmonics of typical loops often lie in the band where LISA is sensitive, 0.1\nto 100 mHz. The harmonic nature of the cosmic string loop modes leaves a\ndistinct spectral signature different from any other known source of\ngravitational waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2009 04:35:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 Aug 2009 21:18:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-02"}

Quantification of operational risk\ncannot be based only on historical data but should involve scenario analysis.\nHistorical internal operational risk loss data have limited ability to predict\nfuture behaviour moreover, banks do not have enough internal data to estimate\nlow frequency high impact events adequately. Historical external data are\ndifficult to use due to different volumes and other factors. In addition,\ninternal and external data have a survival bias, since typically one does not\nhave data of all collapsed companies. The idea of scenario analysis is to\nestimate frequency and severity of risk events via expert opinions taking into\naccount bank environment factors with reference to events that have occurred\n(or may have occurred) in other banks. Scenario analysis is forward looking and\ncan reflect changes in the banking environment. It is important to not only\nquantify the operational risk capital but also provide incentives to business\nunits to improve their risk management policies, which can be accomplished\nthrough scenario analysis. By itself, scenario analysis is very subjective but\ncombined with loss data it is a powerful tool to estimate operational risk\nlosses.

The paper\nfaces the problem by approximating the P-representation of the noisy quantum\nstates with a large but finite number of terms and applying to them the square\nroot measurement (SRM) approach. Comparisons with the exact solution obtained\nwith convex semidefinite programming show that the SRM approach gives quite\naccurate results.

The fraction of\ngalaxies with an X-ray detected nuclear BH is higher (~60 per cent) for\nellipticals and early-type spirals (E to Sb), and lower (~30 per cent) for\nlate-type spirals (Sc to Sm). There is no preferential association of X-ray\ncores with a large-scale bar; in fact, strongly barred galaxies appear to have\nslightly lower detection fraction and luminosity for their nuclear X-ray\nsources, compared with non-barred or weakly barred galaxies of similar Hubble\ntypes. The cumulative luminosity distribution of the nuclear sources in the\n0.3-8 keV band is a power-law with slope ~-0.5, from ~2 x 10^{38} erg/s to\n~10^{42} erg/s. The Eddington ratio is lower for ellipticals (L_{X}/L_{Edd} ~\n10^{-8}) and higher for late-type spirals (up to L_{X}/L_{Edd} ~ 10^{-4}), but\nin all cases, the accretion rate is low enough to be in the\nradiatively-inefficient regime.

We assign to each object in C_F an operator on the space of\nstates of the CFT, the perturbed defect operator, and show that the assignment\nfactors through the Grothendieck ring of C_F. This allows one to find\nfunctional relations between perturbed defect operators. Such relations are\ninteresting because they contain information about the integrable structure of\nthe CFT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2009 12:12:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 2009 18:29:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-23"}

Both the\nshape and the kinetics of breakage of the capillary bridge for various coatings\nput into contact with liquids of various viscosities and surface tensions have\nbeen studied. Several pull off regimes can be distinguished. For low pull off\nvelocities, a quasi-static regime is observed, well described by capillary\nequations and sensitive to the hysteresis of the contact angle of the fluid on\nthe coating. Above a critical pull off velocity that depends on the fluid\nviscosity, a dynamic regime is observed, characterized by the formation of a\nflat pancake of fluid on the coating that recedes more slowly than the\ncapillary bridge itself. After the breakage of the capillary bridge, a small\ndrop can remain attached to the surface. The volume of this drop depends on the\ndynamical regime and is strongly affected by very small differences between the\ncoatings. The aptitude of this test in characterizing very weakly adhesive\nsurfaces is exemplified by a comparison between three different perfluorinated\ncoatings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2009 15:22:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-08"}

Tides raised on a planet's host star\ncause the planet's orbit to decay, even after the orbital eccentricity has\ndropped to zero. Comparison of the observed orbital distribution and\npredictions of tidal theory show good qualitative agreement, suggesting tidal\ndestruction of close-in exoplanets is common. The process can explain the\nobserved cut-off in small a-values, the clustering of orbital periods near\nthree days, and the relative youth of transiting planets. Contrary to previous\nconsiderations, a mechanism to stop the inward migration of close-in planets at\ntheir current orbits is not necessarily required. Planets nearing tidal\ndestruction may be found with extremely small a, possibly already stripped of\nany gaseous envelope. The recently discovered CoRoT-Exo-7 b may be an example\nof such a planet and will probably be destroyed by tides within the next few\nGyrs. Also, where one or more planets have already been accreted, a star may\nexhibit an unusual composition and/or spin rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2009 15:31:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}
