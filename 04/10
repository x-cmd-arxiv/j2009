The participation of non-holomorphic Kaluza-Klein mode\nwave functions dilutes the mass hierarchy in comparison to the quark and\ncharged lepton sectors, in agreement with experimentally measured mass\nsplittings. The neutrinos are predicted to exhibit a \"normal\" mass hierarchy,\nwith masses m_3,m_2,m_1 ~ .05*(1,(alpha_GUT)^(1/2),alpha_GUT) eV. When the\ninteractions of the neutrino and charged lepton sectors geometrically unify,\nthe neutrino mixing matrix exhibits a mild hierarchical structure such that the\nmixing angles theta_23 and theta_12 are large and comparable, while theta_13 is\nexpected to be smaller and close to the Cabibbo angle: theta_13 ~ theta_C ~\n(alpha_GUT)^(1/2) ~ 0.2.

The understanding of fossil fields origin, topology and stability is\none of the corner stones of the stellar magnetism theory. On one hand, since\nthey survive over secular time-scales, they may modify the structure and the\nevolution of their host stars. On the other hand, they must have a complex\nstable structure since it has been demonstrated by Tayler and collaborators\nthat simplest purely poloidal or toroidal fields are unstable on dynamical\ntime-scales. In this context, the only stable configuration which has been\nfound today is the one resulting of a numerical simulation by Braithwaite and\ncollaborators who have studied the evolution of an initial stochastic magnetic\nfield, which is found to relax on a mixed stable configuration (poloidal and\ntoroidal) that seems to be in equilibrium and then diffuses. Aims. In this\nwork, we thus go on the track of such type of equilibrium field in a\nsemi-analytical way. Methods. In this first article, we study the barotropic\nmagnetohydrostatic equilibrium states; the problem reduces to a\nGrad-Shafranov-like equation with arbitrary functions. Those latters are\nconstrained by deriving the lowest-energy equilibrium states for given\ninvariants of the considered axisymmetric problem and in particular for a given\nhelicity which is known to be one of the main actor of such problems.

It must be variable when the radial comoving\ndifferential coordinates of FLRW is interpreted as physical and therefore\ntransformable by a Lorentz transform locally to differentials of stationary\nphysical coordinates. Because the FLRW differential radial distance has a time\nvarying coefficient a(t), integration of the transformed differentials to\nobtain stationary coordinates for a short radial distance requires the light\nspeed c(t) to be proportional to the square root of da/dt. Since we assume\nhomogeneity of space, this derived c(t) is the physical light speed on all\npoints of the FLRW universe. This impacts the interpretation of all\nastronomical observations of distant phenomena that are sensitive to light\nspeed. A world transform from FLRW that has a Minkowski metric close to the\norigin is shown to have a physical radius out to all points of the visible\nuniverse. In order to obtain numerical values for c(t), the general relativity\n(GR) field equation is extended by using a variable gravitational constant and\nrest mass that keeps constant the gravitational and particle rest energies.\nThis also keeps constant the proportionality constant between the GR tensors of\nthe field equation and conserves the rest stress-energy tensor of the ideal\nfluid used in the FLRW GR field equation.

The Chandra upper limit\non the X-ray luminosity during the peak of the flare, L_{X}(2-10 keV)< 10^{41}\nerg s^{-1}, is 2 orders of magnitude fainter than expected from the ratios of\nUV to X-ray flux density observed in active galaxies.

Studying the variability in polarization makes it possibly\nto distinguish between different emission mechanisms. Thus it can help\nanswering the question if intranight variability in radio-loud and radio-quiet\nAGN is of the same or of fundamentally different origin. In this paper we\ninvestigate intranight polarization variability in AGN. Our sample consists of\n28 AGN at low to moderate redshifts (0.048 < z < 1.036), 12 of which are\nradio-quiet quasars (RQQs) and 16 are radio-loud blazars.

There seems to be a dividing line\nfor polarization intranight variability at P~5 per cent over which all objects\nvary in polarization. Only two out of 12 radio-quiet quasars show polarized\nemission, both at levels of P<1 per cent. The lack of polarization intranight\nvariability in radio-quiet AGN points towards accretion instabilities being the\ncause for intranight flux variability whereas the high duty cycle of\npolarization variability in radio-loud objects is more likely caused by\ninstabilities in the jet or changes of physical conditions in the jet plasma.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Apr 2009 20:07:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

It was recently noticed that somewhat heavier Higgs bosons, which\nare naturally beyond the LEP bound, may be obtained by enhanced weak SU(2)\nD-terms. Such contributions appear in models with an enhanced electroweak gauge\nsymmetry, provided the supersymmetry breaking masses associated with the\nscalars responsible for the breakdown of the enhanced gauge symmetry group to\nthe Standard Model one, are larger than the enhanced symmetry breaking scale.\nIn this article we emphasize that the enhanced SU(2) D-terms will not only\nraise the Higgs boson mass but also affect the spectrum of the non-standard\nHiggs bosons, sleptons and squarks, which therefore provide a natural\ncontribution to the T parameter, compensating for the negative one coming from\nthe heavy Higgs boson. The sleptons and non-standard Higgs bosons of these\nmodels, in particular, may act in a way similar to the so-called inert Higgs\ndoublet. The phenomenological properties of these models are emphasized and\npossible cosmological implications as well as collider signatures are\ndescribed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Apr 2009 04:21:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-07"}

In 1964,\nBell showed that certain types of classical models cannot explain the quantum\nmechanical predictions for specific states of distant particles. Along this\nline, some types of hidden variable models have been experimentally ruled out.\nAn intuitive feature for classical models is non-contextuality: the property\nthat any measurement has a value which is independent of other compatible\nmeasurements being carried out at the same time. However, the results of\nKochen, Specker, and Bell show that non-contextuality is in conflict with\nquantum mechanics. The conflict resides in the structure of the theory and is\nindependent of the properties of special states. It has been debated whether\nthe Kochen-Specker theorem could be experimentally tested at all. Only\nrecently, first tests of quantum contextuality have been proposed and\nundertaken with photons and neutrons. Yet these tests required the generation\nof special quantum states and left various loopholes open. Here, using trapped\nions, we experimentally demonstrate a state-independent conflict with\nnon-contextuality.

To have a full knowledge on spectrum, we\nalso give the result for a heavier as well as for lighter sbottom masses.

Our interest in such a language is twofold. First, it can be motivated as\na fundamental study of the representation of causal knowledge. Causality has an\ninherent dynamic aspect, which has been studied at the semantical level by\nShafer in his framework of probability trees. In such a dynamic context, where\nthe evolution of a domain over time is considered, the idea of a causal law as\nsomething which guides this evolution is quite natural. In our formalization, a\nset of probabilistic causal laws can be used to represent a class of\nprobability trees in a concise, flexible and modular way. In this way, our work\nextends Shafer's by offering a convenient logical representation for his\nsemantical objects.\n  Second, this language also has relevance for the area of probabilistic logic\nprogramming. In particular, we prove that the formal semantics of a theory in\nour language can be equivalently defined as a probability distribution over the\nwell-founded models of certain logic programs, rendering it formally quite\nsimilar to existing languages such as ICL or PRISM. Because we can motivate and\nexplain our language in a completely self-contained way as a representation of\nprobabilistic causal laws, this provides a new way of explaining the intuitions\nbehind such probabilistic logic programs: we can say precisely which knowledge\nsuch a program expresses, in terms that are equally understandable by a\nnon-logician. Moreover, we also obtain an additional piece of knowledge\nrepresentation methodology for probabilistic logic programs, by showing how\nthey can express probabilistic causal laws.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Apr 2009 10:00:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-13"}

The ratio of the host stellar\nmass to the black hole mass is only marginally consistent with the locally\nobserved ratio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Apr 2009 15:57:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2009 22:18:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-17"}
