These\nsimulations include a self-consistent treatment of all the major physical\nprocesses involved in galaxy formation. The simulated galaxies presented here\neach have a total mass of ~10^12 M_sun, but span a range of merger histories.\nThese simulations allow us to study the competing importance of in-situ star\nformation (stars formed in the primary galaxy) and accretion of stars from\nsubhalos in the building of stellar halos in a LambdaCDM universe. All four\nsimulated galaxies are surrounded by a stellar halo, whose inner regions (r <\n20 kpc) contain both accreted stars, and an in-situ stellar population. The\nouter regions of the galaxies' halos were assembled through pure accretion and\ndisruption of satellites. Most of the in-situ halo stars formed at high\nredshift out of smoothly accreted cold gas in the inner 1 kpc of the galaxies'\npotential wells, possibly as part of their primordial disks. These stars were\ndisplaced from their central locations into the halos through a succession of\nmajor mergers. We find that the two galaxies with recently quiescent merger\nhistories have a higher fraction of in-situ stars (~20-50%) in their inner\nhalos than the two galaxies with many recent mergers (~5-10% in-situ fraction).\nObservational studies concentrating on stellar populations in the inner halo of\nthe Milky Way will be the most affected by the presence of in-situ stars with\nhalo kinematics, as we find that their existence in the inner few tens of kpc\nis a generic feature of galaxy formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2009 19:03:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2009 19:51:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-24"}

The study is carried\nout using a fully relativistic treatment in Kerr spacetime, with the focus\nbeing to determine the spin dependence of the Blandford-Znajek effect. We find\nthat large scale magnetic fields are enhanced on the black hole compared to the\ninner accretion flow and that the ease with which this occurs for lower\nprograde black hole spin, produces a spin dependence in the Blandford-Znajek\neffect that has attractive applications to recent observations.

If the black hole\nrotation in these elliptical galaxies is in the prograde sense compared with\nthat of the inner accretion disk, we show that both the absolute value and the\nuniformity of the implied jet-production efficiency can be explained by the\nflux-trapping model.

Using F625W, F435W,\nand F658N filters with the Wide Field Channel we show that these stars, 18 of\nwhich are newly discovered, have magnitudes and colors consistent with those of\nhelium-core white dwarfs (He WDs) with masses ~ 0.2-0.3 Msun. Their\nH-alpha--R625 colors indicate that they have strong H-alpha absorption lines,\nwhich distinguishes them from cataclysmic variables in the cluster. The radial\ndistribution of the He WDs is significantly more concentrated to the cluster\ncenter than that of either the CO WDs or the turnoff stars and most closely\nresembles that of the cluster's blue stragglers. Binary companions are required\nto explain the implied dynamical masses. We show that the companions cannot be\nmain-sequence stars and are most likely heavy CO WDs. The number and\nphotometric masses of the observed He WDs can be understood if ~1-5% of the\nmain-sequence stars within the half-mass radius of the cluster have white dwarf\ncompanions with orbital periods in the range ~1-20 days at the time they reach\nthe turnoff. In contrast to the CO WD sequence, the He WD sequence comes to an\nend at R625 ~ 24.5, well above the magnitude limit of the observations.

Despite these efforts, a consensus on this question has yet\nto be reached. Experimentally, the peak effect indicates a transition from a\ndepinned vortex phase to a reentrant pinning phase at high magnetic field. To\nstudy the effects of intrinsic pinning on the peak effect, we consider\nFe$_{x}$Ni$_{1-x}$Zr$_{2}$ superconducting metallic glasses in which the vortex\npinning force varies depending on the Fe content and in which a huge peak\neffect is seen as a function of magnetic field. The results are mapped out as a\nphase diagram in which it is readily seen that the peak effect becomes broader\nwith decreasing pinning force. Typically, pinning can be understood by\nincreased pinning centers, but here, we show that reentrant pinning is due to\nthe strengthening of interactions (while decreasing pinning strength).

They further show thatthere is no deterministic\nPareto-optimal auction with private budgets. Our main contribution is to show\nthe following Budget Monotonicity property of this auction: When there is only\none infinitely divisible good, a bidder cannot improve her utility by reporting\na budget smaller than the truth. This implies that a randomized modification to\nthe adaptive clinching auction is incentive compatible and Pareto-optimal with\nprivate budgets.\n  The Budget Monotonicity property also implies other improved results in this\ncontext. For revenue maximization, the same auction improves the best-known\ncompetitive ratio due to Abrams by a factor of 4, and asymptotically approaches\nthe performance of the optimal single-price auction.\n  Finally, we consider the problem of revenue maximization (or social welfare)\nin a Bayesian setting. We allow the bidders have public size constraints (on\nthe amount of good they are willing to buy) in addition to private budget\nconstraints. We show a simple poly-time computable 5.83-approximation to the\noptimal Bayesian incentive compatible mechanism, that is implementable in\ndominant strategies.

The forced\nlibration is caused by the satellite's slightly eccentric orbit and\nnon-spherical shape.\n  Detection of a moon's forced libration allows us to probe its interior by\ncomparing the measured amplitude to that predicted by a shape model assuming\nconstant density. A discrepancy between the two would indicate internal density\nasymmetries. For Epimetheus, the uncertainties in the shape model are large\nenough to account for the measured libration amplitude. For Janus, on the other\nhand, although we cannot rule out synchronous rotation, a permanent offset of\nseveral degrees between Janus' minimum moment of inertia (long axis) and the\nequilibrium sub-Saturn point may indicate that Janus does have modest internal\ndensity asymmetries.\n  The rotation states of Janus and Epimetheus experience a perturbation every\nfour years, as the two moons \"swap\" orbits. The sudden change in the orbital\nperiods produces a free libration about synchronous rotation that is\nsubsequently damped by internal friction.

Formation of the disc can be caused by\nthat the angular momentum of the RPP formed by the merger is greater than the\ncritical angular momentum for a solid body. One or several satellites of the\nprimary (moving mainly in low-eccentricity orbits) can be formed from this disc\nat any separation less than the Hill radius.

Our model applies to\nstar formation in GMCs dominated by large-scale turbulence, and contains four\nmain stages: core building, core collapse, envelope infall, and late accretion.\nDuring the building stage, cores form out of dense, post-shock gas, and become\nincreasingly centrally stratified as the mass grows over time. When the shock\nradius defining the core boundary exceeds $R\\approx 4 a (4\\pi G\n\\rho_{mean})^{-1/2}$, where $a$ is the isothermal sound speed, a wave of\ncollapse propagates from the edge to the center. During the building and\ncollapse stages, density profiles can be fit by Bonnor-Ebert profiles with\ntemperature 1.2 - 2.9 times the true value. As found previously for initially\nstatic equilibria, outside-in collapse leads to a Larson-Penston density\nprofile $\\rho \\approx 8.86 a^2/(4 \\pi G r^2)$. The third stage, consisting of\nan inside-out wave of gravitational rarefaction leading to $\\rho\\propto\nr^{-3/2}$, $v\\propto r^{-1/2}$, is also similar to that for initially-static\nspheres, as originally described by Shu.

The discrete spacing between atoms in condensed\nmatter has thus set a rigid limit on the maximum possible information density.\nWhile modern technologies are still far from this scale, all theoretical\ndownscaling of devices terminates at this spatial limit. Here, however, we\nbreak this barrier with electronic quantum encoding scaled to subatomic\ndensities. We use atomic manipulation to first construct open\nnanostructures--\"molecular holograms\"--which in turn concentrate information\ninto a medium free of lattice constraints: the quantum states of a\ntwo-dimensional degenerate Fermi gas of electrons. The information embedded in\nthe holograms is transcoded at even smaller length scales into an atomically\nuniform area of a copper surface, where it is densely projected into both two\nspatial degrees of freedom and a third holographic dimension mapped to energy.\nIn analogy to optical volume holography, this requires precise amplitude and\nphase engineering of electron wavefunctions to assemble pages of information\nvolumetrically. This data is read out by mapping the energy-resolved electron\ndensity of states with a scanning tunnelling microscope. As the projection and\nreadout are both extremely near-field, and because we use native quantum states\nrather than an external beam, we are not limited by lensing or collimation and\ncan create electronically projected objects with features as small as ~0.3 nm.\nThese techniques reach unprecedented densities exceeding 20 bits/nm2 and place\ntens of bits into a single fermionic state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2009 00:43:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

However, physical initial states are\nnon-Gaussian correlated initial states.

In order to identify\nphysical nonequilibrium initial states, it is therefore a precondition to\ndescribe the vacuum correlations of the interacting theory within the\nnonequilibrium framework. In this paper, Kadanoff-Baym equations for\nnon-Gaussian correlated initial states describing vacuum and thermal\nequilibrium are derived from the 2PI effective action.

In this study, the dihydrodiol dehydrogenase from the\nPAH-degrading Sphingomonas strain CHY-1 has been characterized. The bphB gene\nencoding PAH dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (PDDH) was cloned and overexpressed as a\nHis-tagged protein. The recombinant protein was purified as a homotetramer with\nan apparent Mr of 110,000. PDDH oxidized the cis-dihydrodiols derived from\nbiphenyl and eight polycyclic hydrocarbons, including chrysene,\nbenz[a]anthracene, and benzo[a]pyene, to corresponding catechols. Remarkably,\nthe enzyme oxidized pyrene 4,5-dihydrodiol, whereas pyrene is not metabolized\nby strain CHY-1. The PAH catechols produced by PDDH rapidly auto-oxidized in\nair but were regenerated upon reaction of the o-quinones formed with NADH.\nKinetic analyses performed under anoxic conditions revealed that the enzyme\nefficiently utilized two- to four-ring dihydrodiols, with Km values in the\nrange of 1.4 to 7.1 $\\mu$M, and exhibited a much higher Michaelis constant for\nNAD+ (Km of 160 $\\mu$M).

The catalytic activity of\nthe enzyme was 13-fold higher at pH 9.5. PDDH was subjected to inhibition by\nNADH and by 3,4-dihydroxyphenanthrene, and the inhibition patterns suggested\nthat the mechanism of the reaction was ordered Bi Bi. The regulation of PDDH\nactivity appears as a means to prevent the accumulation of PAH catechols in\nbacterial cells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2009 08:04:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-24"}

A third important\nbranch of 20th century `fundamental' physics, condensed-matter physics, also\noffers an interesting perspective on quantum gravity, and thereby on the\nproblem of time.

A first lesson is that there are\nprobably several characteristic scales associated with \"quantum gravity\"\neffects, rather than the single Planck scale usually considered. These can\ndiffer by several orders of magnitude, and thereby conspire to hide certain\neffects expected from quantum gravity, rendering them undetectable even with\nPlanck-scale experiments.

The\ntemperature map is uniquely able to identify the substructure in an almost\nrelaxed cluster which would be unnoticed in the ICM electron number density and\npressure maps. We describe the radial fluctuations in the 2-D maps by a\ncumulative/differential scatter profile relative to the mean profile within/at\na given radius.

The amplitude of and the discontinuity in the scatter complement 2-D\nsubstructure diagnostics, e.g. indicating the most disturbed radial range.\nThere is a tantalizing link between the substructure identified using the\nscatter of the entropy and pressure fluctuations and the hydrostatic mass bias\nrelative to the expected mass based on the M-Yx and M-Mgas relations\nparticularly at r500.

This interpretation has however been challenged with a bipolar outflow\nproposed as an alternative explanation. We compare the two proposed scenarios\nfor best consistency with the observations. Using a newly developed formalism\nwe model the optical depth of the maser emission at each observed point in the\nmap and LOS velocity for the two scenarios. We find that if the emission is\nsymmetric around a central peak in both space and LOS velocity then it has to\narise from an edge-on disc in sufficiently fast differential rotation. Disc\nmodels successfully fit ~100 independent measurement points in\nposition-velocity space with 4 free parameters to an overall accuracy of 3-4%.\nSolutions for Keplerian rotation require a central mass of at least 4 solar\nmasses. Close to best-fitting models are obtained if Keplerian motion is\nassumed around a central mass equaling ~30 solar masses as inferred from other\nobservations. In contrast we find that classical bipolar outflow models cannot\nfit the data, although could be applicable in other sources. Our results\nstrongly favour the differentially rotating disc hypothesis to describe the\nmain feature of the 12.2 (and 6.7) GHz methanol maser emission in NGC7538 IRS1\nN. Furthermore, for Keplerian rotation around a ~30 solar masses protostar we\npredict the position and velocity at which tangentially amplified masers should\nbe detected in high dynamic range observations.

The temperature dependences of specific\nheat, mean staggered occupation, and of a generalized susceptibility indicate\ncontinuous order-disorder phase transitions at finite temperatures in two- and\nthree-dimensional systems.
