First, novice students often treat\ncomputer code as almost magic incantations, and like novices in many fields,\nhave trouble creating new algorithms or procedures to solve novel problems.\nSecond, the nature of computational studies often means that the results\ngenerated are interpreted via theoretically devised quantities, which may not\nmeet a student's internal standards for proof when compared to an experimental\nmeasurement.\n  The paper then offers a lab/programming assignment, used in a calculus-based\nphysics course, which was devised to address these problems. In the assignment,\nstudents created a computational model of the heat flow involved in heating an\niron rod in a blacksmith's forge. After creating the simulation, students\nattended a blacksmithing seminar and had a chance to work with iron and take\ndata on its heating in a coke-fueled forge. On their return to campus, students\nrevised their computational models in light of their experimental data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Apr 2009 03:19:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 May 2009 16:52:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 1 Aug 2009 16:33:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-01"}

The unique properties of the neutrino make it peerless\nas a cosmic messenger, enabling the study of dense and distant astrophysical\nobjects at high energy. The experimental challenge, however, is enormous. Due\nto the weakly interacting nature of neutrinos and the expected low fluxes very\nlarge detectors are required.

The image deformation due to the refraction\nand geometrical configuration of the test section is quantitatively\ninvestigated. It is calculated that the image is enlarged by about 20% in inner\ndiameter compared to the real object, which is validated by the experimental\nresults. Meanwhile, the image deformation by adding a rectangular optical\ncorrection box outside the circular tube is comparatively investigated. It is\ncalculated that the image is reduced by about 20% in inner diameter with a\nrectangular optical correction box compared to the real object. The 3D\nre-construction process based on the two views is conducted through three\nsteps, which shows that 3D visualization method can be easily applied for\ntwo-phase flow research in micro-scale channels and improves the measurement\naccuracy of some important parameters of two-phase flow such as void fraction,\nspatial distribution of bubbles, etc..\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Apr 2009 14:32:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-12"}

Synergy between experimental and\ntheoretical work, both playing a crucial role, has been at the heart of these\nadvances. On the theoretical front, the adoption of Berry-phase concepts has\nestablished a link between the AHE and the topological nature of the Hall\ncurrents which originate from spin-orbit coupling. On the experimental front,\nnew experimental studies of the AHE in transition metals, transition-metal\noxides, spinels, pyrochlores, and metallic dilute magnetic semiconductors, have\nmore clearly established systematic trends. These two developments in concert\nwith first-principles electronic structure calculations, strongly favor the\ndominance of an intrinsic Berry-phase-related AHE mechanism in metallic\nferromagnets with moderate conductivity. The intrinsic AHE can be expressed in\nterms of Berry-phase curvatures and it is therefore an intrinsic quantum\nmechanical property of a perfect cyrstal. An extrinsic mechanism, skew\nscattering from disorder, tends to dominate the AHE in highly conductive\nferromagnets. We review the full modern semiclassical treatment of the AHE\ntogether with the more rigorous quantum-mechanical treatments based on the Kubo\nand Keldysh formalisms, taking into account multiband effects, and demonstrate\nthe equivalence of all three linear response theories in the metallic regime.\nFinally we discuss outstanding issues and avenues for future investigation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Apr 2009 07:08:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}
