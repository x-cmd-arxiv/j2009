However, for\nnon-trivially-embedded surface operators, exact S-duality holds only if the\nquantum parameter effectively vanishes, while the overall SL(2, Z) (or a\ncongruence subgroup thereof) duality holds up to a c-number at most,\nregardless. Via the formalism of duality walls, we furnish an alternative\nderivation of the transformation of parameters - found also to be consistent\nwith a switch from Wilson to 't Hooft loop operators under S-duality.

In this work, we present a systematic analysis of BCGs and strong\nradio AGN in 152 groups and clusters from the Chandra archive. All 69 BCGs with\nradio AGN more luminous than 2x10^23 W Hz^-1 at 1.4 GHz are found to have X-ray\ncool cores. The BCG cool cores can be divided into two classes, the\nlarge-cool-core (LCC) class and the corona class.

Strong radio outbursts\ntriggered by coronae may destroy embryonic large cool cores and thus provide\nanother mechanism to prevent formation of large cool cores. However, it is\nunclear whether coronae are decoupled from the radio feedback cycles as they\nhave to be largely immune to strong radio outbursts. Our sample study also\nshows the absence of groups with a luminous cool core while hosting a strong\nradio AGN, which is not observed in clusters.

Second, the coupling between acoustic waves and the magnetic\nfield, in particular the phenomenon of wave conversion and wave refraction.

This answers the first\nopen problem in the list of open problems from the 2006 IITK Workshop on\nAlgorithms for Data Streams. Specifically, suppose Alice receives a vector x in\n{-M,...,M}^n and Bob receives y in {-M,...,M}^n, and the two parties share\nrandomness. Each party must output a short sketch of their vector such that a\nthird party can later quickly recover a (1 +/- eps)-approximation to ||x-y||_1\nwith 2/3 probability given only the sketches. We give a sketching algorithm\nwhich produces O(eps^{-2}log(1/eps)log(nM))-bit sketches in O(n*log^2(nM))\ntime, independent of eps. The previous best known sketching algorithm for L_1\nis due to [Feigenbaum et al., SICOMP 2002], which achieved the optimal sketch\nlength of O(eps^{-2}log(nM)) bits but had a running time of O(n*log(nM)/eps^2).\nNotice that our running time is near-linear for every eps, whereas for\nsufficiently small values of eps, the running time of the previous algorithm\ncan be as large as quadratic.

In this article we introduce\nthe concept of cognitive wireless mesh (CogMesh) networks and address the\nunique problem in such a network. CogMesh is a self-organized distributed\nnetwork architecture combining cognitive technologies with the mesh structure\nin order to provide a uniform service platform over a wide range of networks.\nIt is based on dynamic spectrum access (DSA) and featured by self-organization,\nself-configuration and self-healing. The unique problem in CogMesh is the\ncommon control channel problem, which is caused by the opportunistic spectrum\nsharing nature of secondary users (SU) in the network. More precisely, since\nthe channels of SUs are fluctuating according to the radio environment, it is\ndifficult to find always available global common control channels. This puts a\nsignificant challenge on the network design. We develop the control cloud based\ncontrol channel selection and cluster based network formation techniques to\ntackle this problem. Moreover, we show in this article that the swarm\nintelligence is a good candidate to deal with the control channel problem in\nCogMesh.

We\ntook advantage of the rare observational opportunity afforded by one of the\nannual equinoxes of Hermione occurring close to its opposition in June 2007.\nThe equinox provides an edge-on aspect for an Earth-based observer, which is\nwell suited to a thorough study of Hermione's physical characteristics. The\ncatalog of observations carried out with small telescopes is presented in this\nwork, together with new adaptive optics (AO) imaging obtained between 2005 and\n2008 with the Yepun 8-m VLT telescope and the 10-m Keck telescope. The most\nstriking result is confirmation that Hermione is a bifurcated and elongated\nbody, as suggested by Marchis et al., (2005). A new effective diameter of 187\n+/- 6 km was calculated from the combination of AO, photometric and thermal\nobservations. The new diameter is some 10% smaller than the hitherto accepted\nradiometric diameter based on IRAS data. The reason for the discrepancy is that\nIRAS viewed the system almost pole-on. New thermal observations with the\nSpitzer Space Telescope agree with the diameter derived from AO and lightcurve\nobservations. On the basis of the new AO astrometric observations of the small\n32-km diameter satellite we have refined the orbit solution and derived a new\nvalue of the bulk density of Hermione of 1.4 +0.5/-0.2 g cm-3. We infer a\nmacroscopic porosity of ~33 +5/-20%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2009 23:56:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The\nstars with Shen(FPS) EOS reach the mass-shedding limit at the smallest(largest)\nangular velocity, while the stars with SLy or Lattimer-Swesty EOSs take the\nmoderate values. (2) For the supramassive sequences, the equilibrium\nconfigurations are found to be generally oblate for the realistic EOSs in sharp\ncontrast to the polytropic stars. For FPS(LS) EOS, the parameter region which\npermits the prolately deformed stars is widest(narrowest). For SLy and Shen\nEOS, it is in medium. Furthermore, the angular velocities $\\Omega_{\\rm up}$,\nabove which the stars start to spin up as they lose angular momentum, are found\nto depend sharply on the realistic EOSs. Our analysis indicates that the\nhierarchy of this spin up angular velocity is $\\Omega_{\\rm up,SLy} >\n\\Omega_{\\rm up,FPS} > \\Omega_{\\rm up,LS}>\\Omega_{\\rm up,Shen}$ and this\nrelation holds even if the sequences have strong magnetic fields. Our results\nsuggest the EOSs within the relativistic stars containing purely toroidal\nmagnetic fields can be constrained by observing the angular velocity, the\ngravitational wave, and the signature of the spin up.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2009 04:31:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-21"}

C-WMMG models a basic\ncooperation rule, the complementary cooperation rule, and can be taken as a\nsister model of the famous weighted majority game (WMG for short). In this\npaper, we concentrate on the two dimensional C-WMMG. An interesting property of\nthis case is that there are at most $n+1$ minimal winning coalitions (MWC for\nshort), and they can be enumerated in time $O(n\\log n)$, where $n$ is the\nnumber of players. This property guarantees that the two dimensional C-WMMG is\nmore handleable than WMG. In particular, we prove that the main power indices,\ni.e. the Shapley-Shubik index, the Penrose-Banzhaf index, the Holler-Packel\nindex, and the Deegan-Packel index, are all polynomially computable. To make a\ncomparison with WMG, we know that it may have exponentially many MWCs, and none\nof the four power indices is polynomially computable (unless P=NP). Still for\nthe two dimensional case, we show that local monotonicity holds for all of the\nfour power indices. In WMG, this property is possessed by the Shapley-Shubik\nindex and the Penrose-Banzhaf index, but not by the Holler-Packel index or the\nDeegan-Packel index. Since our model fits very well the cooperation and\ncompetition in team sports, we hope that it can be potentially applied in\nmeasuring the values of players in team sports, say help people give more\nobjective ranking of NBA players and select MVPs, and consequently bring new\ninsights into contest theory and the more general field of sports economics. It\nmay also provide some interesting enlightenments into the design of\nnon-additive voting mechanisms.

This study thus points out that the Lagrangian\ndynamics though considers stationary action ignores the optimum power loss\ncriterion in the interactive negotiation for the dynamic passage. Taking the\nradiation loss optimization as the additional criterion in the accelerated\nmotion of a charged particle it is shown that the dynamics is necessarily\nexecuted by a family of nonlocally entangled paths. In the coherent\nentanglement the paths unitarily evolves in space-time conserving the instant\nenergy and momentum integrally over the volume. The evolution dictates\nquantized energy and momentum, and defines the rationale behind decoherence\nwith radiation relaxation. Under the sustained interaction the nonlocal field\nincessantly attempt defending the unitary evolutions at the cost of the\nrelaxation loss from the external field. The nonlocally mediated\nelectrodynamics is free of issues like acceleration runaway in the decohered\ninteraction of moving charge with external field, where relaxation occurs both\nin ordered (Larmor radiation) and disordered (thermal radiation) forms, the\nlatter generally being insignificant in proportion. The thermal relaxation rate\nis shown to be akin to that in Hawking-Unruh radiations.

We show that with the Bacon-Shor code the scheme can be\nimplemented using Hamiltonian operators of weight 2 and 3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2009 15:35:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 2009 09:02:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-20"}

The Casimir-Lifshitz force is obtained by\ncalculating the electromagnetic stress tensor, using the method employed by\nAntezza et al. [Phys. Rev. A 77, 022901 (2008)] for non-moving plates at\ndifferent temperatures. The perpendicular force on the plates has contributions\nfrom the quantum vacuum and from the thermal radiation; both of these\ncontributions are influenced by the motion. In addition to the perpendicular\nforce, thermal radiation from the moving plates gives rise to a lateral\ncomponent of the Casimir-Lifshitz force, an effect with no quantum-vacuum\ncontribution. The zero-temperature results are reproduced, in particular the\nnon-existence of a quantum-vacuum friction between the plates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2009 15:50:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Apr 2009 14:26:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 11 May 2009 16:02:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-11"}
