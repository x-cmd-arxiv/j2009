Our self-consistent field method is distinct from others in that\nthe equilibrium orbital angular velocity is calculated automatically rather\nthan being prescribed, which is crucial for obtaining apsidal motion rates\naccurately. We find that the centrifugal and tidal forces make perturbed stars\nmore centrally condensed and larger in size. For n=1.5 polytopes with fixed\nentropy, the enhancement factor in stellar radii is about 23% and 4-8% for mu=1\nand sim0.1-0.9, respectively, where mu is the fractional mass of the polytrope\nrelative to the total.

When the perturbations are\nstrong as in critical configurations, the classical theory underestimates the\nreal apsidal motion rates by as much as 50% for n=1.5 polytropes, although the\ndiscrepancy becomes smaller as n increases.

It is\ngenerally assumed that shot noise is white and given by the inverse of the\nnumber density n. In this paper we argue one may be able to considerably\nimprove upon this: in the halo picture of cosmological structure all of the\ndark matter is in halos of varying mass and galaxies are formed inside these\nhalos, but for the dark matter mass and momentum conservation guarantee that\nnonlinear effects cannot develop a white noise in the dark matter power\nspectrum on large scales. This suggests that with a suitable weighting a\nsimilar effect may be achieved for galaxies, suppressing their shot noise. We\nexplore this idea with N-body simulations by weighting central halo galaxies by\nhalo mass and find that the resulting shot noise can be reduced dramatically\nrelative to expectations, with a 10-30 suppression at the highest number\ndensity of n=4*10^-3 (Mpc/h)^3 resolved in our simulations. For specific\napplications other weighting schemes may achieve even better results and for\nn=3*10^-4(Mpc/h)^3 we can reduce sigma_n^2/P by up to a factor of 10 relative\nto uniform weighting. These results open up new opportunities to extract\ncosmological information in galaxy surveys, such as the recently proposed\nmulti-tracer approach to cancel sampling variance, and may have important\nconsequences for the planning of future redshift surveys.

However, electron density\nfluctuations in the leading edge of the front and non-thermal stretched tails\nof the electron energy distribution (as a cause of X-ray emissions) require a\nparticle model to follow the electron motion. As super-particle methods create\nwrong statistics and numerical artifacts, modeling the individual electron\ndynamics in streamers is limited to early stages where the total electron\nnumber still is limited.\n  The method of choice is a hybrid computation in space where individual\nelectrons are followed in the region of high electric field and low density\nwhile the bulk of the electrons is approximated by densities (or fluids). We\nhere develop the hybrid coupling for planar fronts.

As it transits its parent star, it is the only Neptune-mass\nextrasolar planet of known mass and radius, being slightly larger and more\nmassive than Neptune (M=22.6 M_Earth, R=4.19R_Earth). In this regime, several\nbulk compositions are possible: from an Earth-like core with a thick hydrogen\nenvelope to a water-rich planet with a thin hydrogen envelope comprising a\nNeptune-like structure. We combine planet-structure modeling with an advanced\nplanet-formation model to assess the likelihood of the different possible bulk\ncompositions of GJ 436 b.

However, the two-point statistics only measure\nthe Gaussian properties of the field and the weak lensing field is\nnon-Gaussian. It has been shown that the estimation of non-Gaussian statistics\non weak lensing data can improve the constraints on cosmological parameters. In\nthis paper, we systematically compare a wide range of non-Gaussian estimators\nin order to determine which one provides tighter constraints on the\ncosmological parameters. These statistical methods include skewness, kurtosis\nand the Higher Criticism test in several sparse representations such as wavelet\nand curvelet; as well as the bispectrum, peak counting and a new introduced\nstatistic called Wavelet Peak Counting (WPC). Comparisons based on sparse\nrepresentations show that the wavelet transform is the most sensitive to\nnon-Gaussian cosmological structures.

Macroscopic inhomogeneity emerges naturally if pinning occurs at\ncrustal faults. If, instead, pinning occurs at lattice sites and defects, which\nare macroscopically homogeneous, we show that an alternative, noncritical\nself-organization process operates, termed coherent noise, wherein the global\nMagnus force acts uniformly on vortices trapped in a range of pinning\npotentials and undergoing thermal creep. It is found that vortices again unpin\ncollectively, but not via nearest-neighbor avalanches, and that,\ncounterintuitively, the resulting glitch sizes are scale invariant, in accord\nwith observational data.

In this\npaper, we study the effect of neutrals on the wave propagation in a filament\nthread modeled as a partially ionized homogeneous magnetic flux tube embedded\nin an homogeneous and fully ionized coronal plasma. Ohmic and ambipolar\nmagnetic diffusion are considered in the basic resistive MHD equations. We\nnumerically compute the eigenfrequencies of kink, slow, and Alfven linear MHD\nmodes, and obtain analytical approximations in some cases.

In particular, the lower and upper\nfrequency cut-offs of kink and Alfven waves owe their existence to magnetic\ndiffusion parallel and perpendicular to magnetic field lines, respectively. The\nslow mode only has a lower frequency cut-off, which is caused by perpendicular\nmagnetic diffusion and is significantly affected by the ionization degree.

We found that the\ndiurnal, seasonal and spectral MSTWP characteristics are specified by the solar\nterminator (ST) dynamics. MSTWPs are the chains of narrow-band TEC oscillations\nwith single packet's duration of about 1-2 hours and oscillation periods of\n10-20 minutes. Their total duration is about 4--6 hours. The MSTWP spatial\nstructure is characterized by a high degree of anisotropy and coherence at the\ndistance of more than 10 wavelengths. The MSTWP direction of travelling is\ncharacterized by a high directivity regardless of seasons. Occurrence rate of\ndaytime MSTWPs is high in winter and during equinoxes.

These features are consistent with\nprevious MS travelling ionosphere disturbance (TID) statistics obtained from\n630-nm airglow imaging observations in Japan.

In other words, $N$ is the minimum number of\ngreatest Lyapunov exponents whose sum becomes negative.

The linear (or nearly linear) dependence of $N$ on $R_e$ is consistent\nwith the estimate for the number of active modes deduced from a recent\nmathematical bound for the viscous dissipation wave number.

Since reception orders are in general indeterminate, they cannot\nbe inferred from prior information by mathematical logic alone. Therefore\nmathematical logic cannot in general implement computation.\n  Over the course of history, the term \"Functional Program\" has grown more\nprecise and technical as the field has matured. \"Logic Program\" should be on a\nsimilar trajectory. Accordingly, \"Logic Program\" should have a general precise\ncharacterization. In the fall of 1972, different characterizations of Logic\nPrograms that have continued to this day:\n  * A Logic Program uses Horn-Clause syntax for forward and backward chaining\n  * Each computational step (according to Actor Model) of a Logic Program is\ndeductively inferred (e.g. in Direct Logic).\n  The above examples are illustrative of how issues of inconsistency robustness\nhave repeatedly arisen in Logic Programs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2009 14:07:18 GMT"},{"version":"v10","created":"Fri, 18 Jun 2010 16:44:09 GMT"},{"version":"v11","created":"Mon, 4 Oct 2010 21:02:55 GMT"},{"version":"v12","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2011 19:02:29 GMT"},{"version":"v13","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2011 01:33:09 GMT"},{"version":"v14","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2011 18:31:18 GMT"},{"version":"v15","created":"Tue, 17 May 2011 14:34:20 GMT"},{"version":"v16","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2011 02:36:46 GMT"},{"version":"v17","created":"Sun, 26 Jun 2011 23:31:58 GMT"},{"version":"v18","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2011 19:11:43 GMT"},{"version":"v19","created":"Sun, 18 Sep 2011 14:07:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2009 15:24:23 GMT"},{"version":"v20","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2011 20:47:04 GMT"},{"version":"v21","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2011 06:40:19 GMT"},{"version":"v22","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2012 19:21:20 GMT"},{"version":"v23","created":"Sun, 4 Mar 2012 13:53:31 GMT"},{"version":"v24","created":"Wed, 20 Jun 2012 21:15:29 GMT"},{"version":"v25","created":"Sun, 13 Jan 2013 16:51:38 GMT"},{"version":"v26","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 2013 15:26:43 GMT"},{"version":"v27","created":"Wed, 1 Jan 2014 02:23:44 GMT"},{"version":"v28","created":"Mon, 13 Jan 2014 21:14:32 GMT"},{"version":"v29","created":"Mon, 3 Feb 2014 21:37:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 2009 19:52:06 GMT"},{"version":"v30","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2014 20:53:33 GMT"},{"version":"v31","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 2014 12:36:29 GMT"},{"version":"v32","created":"Mon, 3 Mar 2014 20:07:10 GMT"},{"version":"v33","created":"Sun, 9 Mar 2014 22:19:34 GMT"},{"version":"v34","created":"Mon, 24 Mar 2014 22:10:32 GMT"},{"version":"v35","created":"Sun, 4 May 2014 21:48:36 GMT"},{"version":"v36","created":"Wed, 23 Jul 2014 20:25:43 GMT"},{"version":"v37","created":"Tue, 4 Nov 2014 20:43:00 GMT"},{"version":"v38","created":"Sun, 23 Nov 2014 23:13:49 GMT"},{"version":"v39","created":"Mon, 29 Dec 2014 18:41:01 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2009 08:22:06 GMT"},{"version":"v40","created":"Tue, 17 Feb 2015 18:30:46 GMT"},{"version":"v41","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2015 06:23:10 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2009 15:37:33 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2009 07:30:37 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Sat, 31 Oct 2009 21:59:49 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2009 15:57:46 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Mon, 26 Apr 2010 13:24:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-03"}

In\nNature, this behaviour is known as random mating. However, non-random schemes -\nin which individuals mate according to their kinship or likeness - are more\ncommon in natural systems. Previous studies indicate that, when applied to GAs,\nnegative assortative mating (a specific type of non-random mating, also known\nas dissortative mating) may improve their performance (on both speed and\nreliability) in a wide range of problems. Dissortative mating maintains the\ngenetic diversity at a higher level during the run, and that fact is frequently\nobserved as an explanation for dissortative GAs ability to escape local optima\ntraps. Dynamic problems, due to their specificities, demand special care when\ntuning a GA, because diversity plays an even more crucial role than it does\nwhen tackling static ones. This paper investigates the behaviour of\ndissortative mating GAs, namely the recently proposed Adaptive Dissortative\nMating GA (ADMGA), on dynamic trap functions. ADMGA selects parents according\nto their Hamming distance, via a self-adjustable threshold value. The method,\nby keeping population diversity during the run, provides an effective means to\ndeal with dynamic problems. Tests conducted with deceptive and nearly deceptive\ntrap functions indicate that ADMGA is able to outperform other GAs, some\nspecifically designed for tracking moving extrema, on a wide range of tests,\nbeing particularly effective when speed of change is not very fast. When\ncomparing the algorithm to a previously proposed dissortative GA, results show\nthat performance is equivalent on the majority of the experiments, but ADMGA\nperforms better when solving the hardest instances of the test set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2009 15:57:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-30"}
