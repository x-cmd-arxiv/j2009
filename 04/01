Based on the shape of the rotation curves and guided by a simplicity\ncriterion, we adopt an average galaxy mass baryon fraction of 0.03. In order to\nstudy general behaviors, only models with the average initial conditions are\nanalyzed. The stellar and B-band effective radii, R* and RB, of individual\ngalaxies grow significantly with time (inside-out disc formation) with laws\nthat are weakly dependent on mass, M*,or luminosity, LB. However, the change of\nR* with z at fixed M* is slow; for z<2.5, R*(M*=const) ~ (1+z)^-0.4. On the\nother hand, the change of RB with z at a fixed LB is strong and resembles the\nRB decreasing law of the individual models; roughly RB(LB=const) ~ (1+z)^-0.85\nfor z<0.75, and ~(1+z)^-1.1 for z>0.75. We find also that at z=0, R* ~ M*^0.38\nand RB ~ LB^0.40, remaining the slopes of these relations almost the same up to\nz ~ 3. Our predictions are in reasonable agreement with observational\ninferences on the typical radius change with z of late-type galaxies more\nluminous (massive) than high values imposed by the selection effects. The\nmodels seem also to be consistent, within the large scatter, with the RB and LB\nvalues obtained from non complete samples of sub-L* late-type galaxies with\navailable rest-frame photometric information at different z's. The properties\nand evolution of the LCDM haloes seem to be the main drivers of galaxy disc\nsize evolution. Nevertheless, the models reveal a potential difficulty in\nexplaining the observed steepening of the RB-LB relation with respect to the\nR*-M* one, an effect related to the well established color-magnitude relation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2009 19:24:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2009 03:07:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Many\nprevious studies have investigated this topic, particularly in relation to the\nnon-linear regime of structure formation. However, no careful pre-selection of\nviable quintessence models with high precision cosmological data was performed.\nHere we show that this has led to a misinterpretation (and underestimation) of\nthe imprint of quintessence on the distribution of large scale structures. To\nthis purpose we perform a likelihood analysis of the combined Supernova Ia\nUNION dataset and WMAP5-years data to identify realistic quintessence models.\nDifferences from the vanilla LambdaCDM are especially manifest in the predicted\namplitude and shape of the linear matter power spectrum, though these remain\nwithin the uncertainties of the SDSS data. We use these models as benchmark for\nstudying the clustering properties of dark matter halos by performing a series\nof high resolution N-body simulations. We find that realistic quintessence\nmodels allow for relevant differences of the dark matter distribution with the\nrespect to the LambdaCDM scenario well into the non-linear regime, with\ndeviations up to 40% in the non-linear power spectrum. Such differences are\nshown to depend on the nature of DE, as well as the scale and epoch considered.\nAt small scales (k~1-5 h Mpc^{-1}, depending on the redshift) the structure\nformation process is about 20% more efficient than in LambdaCDM. We show that\nthese imprints are a specific record of the cosmic structure formation history\nin DE cosmologies and therefore cannot be accounted in standard fitting\nfunctions of the non-linear matter power spectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2009 18:54:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 25 Oct 2009 20:07:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2009 09:47:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-04"}

Substantial uncertainties\nin SPS exist, and yet their relevance to the task of comparing galaxy evolution\nmodels to observations has received little attention. In the present work we\nbegin to address this issue by investigating the importance of uncertainties in\nstellar evolution, the initial stellar mass function (IMF), and dust and\ninterstellar medium (ISM) properties on the translation from models to\nobservations. We demonstrate that these uncertainties translate into\nsubstantial uncertainties in the ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared colors\nof synthetic galaxies. Aspects that carry significant uncertainties include the\nlogarithmic slope of the IMF above 1 Msun, dust attenuation law, molecular\ncloud disruption timescale, clumpiness of the ISM, fraction of unobscured\nstarlight, and treatment of advanced stages of stellar evolution including blue\nstragglers, the horizontal branch, and the thermally-pulsating asymptotic giant\nbranch. The interpretation of the resulting uncertainties in the derived colors\nis highly non-trivial because many of the uncertainties are likely systematic,\nand possibly correlated with the physical properties of galaxies.

In order to study the formation process of\nprominences, we examine continuous observations of a prominence in NOAA AR\n10953 with the Solar Optical Telescope on the \\emph{Hinode} satellite. As\nreported in our previous Letter, we find a signature suggesting that a helical\nflux rope emerges from below the photosphere under a pre-existing prominence.\nHere we investigate more detailed properties and photospheric indications of\nthe emerging helical flux rope, and discuss their relationship to the formation\nof the prominence. Our main conclusions are: (1) A dark region with absence of\nstrong vertical magnetic fields broadens and then narrows in Ca \\textsc{ii}\nH-line filtergrams. This phenomenon is consistent with the emergence of the\nhelical flux rope as photospheric counterparts. The size of the flux rope is\nroughly 30,000 km long and 10,000 km wide. The width is larger than that of the\nprominence. (2) No shear motion or converging flows are detected, but we find\ndiverging flows such as mesogranules along the polarity inversion line.

It is shown that proper modelling\nof the intracluster medium, i.e. the main baryonic component, can play an\nimportant role. In fact, the addition of a new contribution accounting for the\ngas can increase the statistical significance of the lensing model. We propose\na parametric method for strong lensing analyses which exploits multi-wavelength\nobservations. The mass model accounts for cluster-sized dark matter halos,\ngalaxies (whose stellar mass can be obtained from optical analyses) and the\nintracluster medium. The gas distribution is fitted to lensing data exploiting\nprior knowledge from X-ray observations. This gives an unbiased look at each\nmatter component and allows us to study the dynamical status of a cluster.}The\nmethod has been applied to AC 114, an irregular X-ray cluster. We find positive\nevidence for dynamical activity, with the dark matter distribution shifted and\nrotated with respect to the gas. On the other hand, the dark matter follows the\ngalaxy density both for shape and orientation, which hints at its collisionless\nnature. The inner region (< 250kpc) is under-luminous in optical bands whereas\nthe gas fraction (~20+- 5%) slightly exceeds typical values. Evidence from\nlensing and X-ray suggests that the cluster develops in the plane of the sky\nand is not affected by the lensing over-concentration bias.

We compute the maximal temperature $T_{max}$, above which\nthe internal space decompactifies, as well as the temperature $T_*$, that is\nreached after the decay of the heaviest moduli. The natural constraint\n$T_*<T_{max}$ implies a lower bound on the allowed values of the internal\nvolume $\\mathcal{V}$.

To a divide, that is a\nproper generic immersion of a finite number of copies of the unit interval and\ncircles in a 2-disc, one can associate a strongly invertible link in the\n3-sphere. This can be generalized to signed divides : divides with + or - sign\nassignment to each crossing point. Conversely, to any link $L$ that is strongly\ninvertible for an involution $j$, one can associate a signed divide. Two\nstrongly invertible links that are isotopic through an isotopy respecting the\ninvolution are called strongly equivalent. Such isotopies give rise to moves on\ndivides. In a previous paper of the author, one can find an exhaustive list of\nmoves that preserves strong equivalence, together with a polynomial invariant\nfor these moves, giving therefore an invariant for strong equivalence of the\nassociated strongly invertible links. We prove in this paper that this\npolynomial can be seen as the graded Euler characteristic of a graded complex\nof vector spaces. Homology of such complexes is invariant for the moves on\ndivides and so is invariant through strong equivalence of strongly invertible\nlinks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2009 06:25:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-26"}

Several mechanisms are at work towards the formation of the\nspindle, one of which is the `capture' of chromosome pairs, held together by\nkinetochores, by randomly searching microtubules. Although the entire cell\ncycle can be up to 24 hours long, the mitotic phase typically takes only less\nthan an hour. How does the cell keep the duration of mitosis within this limit?\nPrevious theoretical studies have suggested that the chromosome search and\ncapture is optimized by tuning the microtubule dynamic parameters to minimize\nthe search time. In this paper, we examine this conjecture. We compute the mean\nsearch time for a single target by microtubules from a single nucleating site,\nusing a systematic and rigorous theoretical approach, for arbitrary kinetic\nparameters. The result is extended to multiple targets and nucleating sites by\nphysical arguments. Estimates of mitotic time scales are then obtained for\ndifferent cells using experimental data. In yeast and mammalian cells, the\nobserved changes in microtubule kinetics between interphase and mitosis are\nbeneficial in reducing the search time.

We\ninvestigate such a system via the newly developed material-point method. The\neffects of shock strength and porosity size are the main concerns. For the same\nporosity, the effects of mean-void-size are checked. It is found that, local\nturbulence mixing and volume dissipation are two important mechanisms for\ntransformation of kinetic energy to heat. When the porosity is very small, the\nshocked portion may arrive at a dynamical steady state; the voids in the\ndownstream portion reflect back rarefactive waves and result in slight\noscillations of mean density and pressure; for the same value of porosity, a\nlarger mean-void-size makes a higher mean temperature. When the porosity\nbecomes large, hydrodynamic quantities vary with time during the whole\nshock-loading procedure: after the initial stage, the mean density and pressure\ndecrease, but the temperature increases with a higher rate. The distributions\nof local density, pressure, temperature and particle-velocity are generally\nnon-Gaussian and vary with time. The changing rates depend on the porosity\nvalue, mean-void-size and shock strength. The stronger the loaded shock, the\nstronger the porosity effects. This work provides a supplement to experiments\nfor the very quick procedures and reveals more fundamental mechanisms in energy\nand momentum transportation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2009 11:55:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Semiclassical corrections\nto warp-drive geometries have been analyzed only for eternal warp-drive bubbles\ntraveling at fixed superluminal speeds. Here, we investigate the more realistic\ncase in which a superluminal warp drive is created out of an initially flat\nspacetime.

While the behavior of the RSET in these geometries has close\nsimilarities to that in the geometries associated with gravitational collapse,\nit shows dramatic differences too.

In this paper we investigate the applicability of the OMP\nfor the solution of ill-posed inverse problems in general and in particular for\ntwo deconvolution examples from mass spectrometry and digital holography\nrespectively.\n  In sparse approximation problems one often has to deal with the problem of\nredundancy of a dictionary, i.e. the atoms are not linearly independent.\nHowever, one expects them to be approximatively orthogonal and this is\nquantified by the so-called incoherence. This idea cannot be transfered to\nill-posed inverse problems since here the atoms are typically far from\northogonal: The ill-posedness of the operator causes that the correlation of\ntwo distinct atoms probably gets huge, i.e. that two atoms can look much alike.\nTherefore one needs conditions which take the structure of the problem into\naccount and work without the concept of coherence. In this paper we develop\nresults for exact recovery of the support of noisy signals. In the two examples\nin mass spectrometry and digital holography we show that our results lead to\npractically relevant estimates such that one may check a priori if the\nexperimental setup guarantees exact deconvolution with OMP.

The\ninterplanetary direct collision (DC) / oblique collision (OC) between both MCs\nresults from their same/different initial propagation orientations. Here the OC\nis explored in contrast to the results of the DC (Xiong et al., 2007). Both the\nslow MC1 and fast MC2 are consequently injected from the different heliospheric\nlatitudes to form a compound stream during the interplanetary propagation. The\nMC1 and MC2 undergo contrary deflections during the process of oblique\ncollision. Their deflection angles of $|\\delta \\theta_1|$ and $|\\delta\n\\theta_2|$ continuously increase until both MC-driven shock fronts are merged\ninto a stronger compound one. The $|\\delta \\theta_1|$, $|\\delta \\theta_2|$, and\ntotal deflection angle $\\Delta \\theta$ ($\\Delta \\theta = |\\delta \\theta_1| +\n|\\delta \\theta_2|$) reach their corresponding maxima when the initial eruptions\nof both MCs are at an appropriate angular difference. Moreover, with the\nincrease of MC2's initial speed, the OC becomes more intense, and the\nenhancement of $\\delta \\theta_1$ is much more sensitive to $\\delta \\theta_2$.\nThe $|\\delta\\theta_1|$ is generally far less than the $|\\delta\\theta_2|$, and\nthe unusual case of $|\\delta\\theta_1|\\simeq|\\delta\\theta_2|$ only occurs for an\nextremely violent OC. But because of the elasticity of the MC body to buffer\nthe collision, this deflection would gradually approach an asymptotic degree.\nTherefore, the deflection due to the OC should be considered for the evolution\nand ensuing geoeffectiveness of interplanetary interaction among successive\ncoronal mass ejections (CMEs).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2009 14:41:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 Apr 2009 14:30:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 23 May 2009 18:29:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-03"}

Obtained value is in a good agreement with previous\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2009 14:52:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-19"}
