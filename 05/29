The central transit times and uncertainties\nwere also calculated, using a residual-permutation algorithm as an independent\ncheck on the errors. A re-analysis of eight previously published TrES-3 light\ncurves was conducted to determine the transit times and uncertainties using\nconsistent techniques. Whilst the transit times were not found to be in\nagreement with a linear ephemeris, giving chi^2 = 35.07 for 15 degrees of\nfreedom, we interpret this to be the result of systematics in the light curves\nrather than a real transit timing variation.

We undertake a coherent analysis of\nvarious portions of observational data on all known components of the system.\nThe goal is to elucidate the architecture and evolutionary status of the\nsystem. We try to further constrain the age and orientation of the system,\norbits and masses of the companions, as well as the location of dust. From the\nhigh luminosity of debris dust and dynamical constraints, we argue for a rather\nyoung system's age of <50Myr. The system must be seen nearly, but not exactly,\npole-on. Our analysis of the stellar rotational velocity yields an inclination\nof 13-30deg, whereas i>20deg is needed for the system to be dynamically stable,\nwhich suggests a probable inclination range of 20-30deg. The spectral energy\ndistribution is naturally reproduced with two dust rings associated with two\nplanetesimal belts. The inner \"asteroid belt\" is located at ~10AU inside the\norbit of the innermost companion and a \"Kuiper belt\" at >100AU is just exterior\nto the orbit of the outermost companion. The dust masses in the inner and outer\nring are estimated to be ~1E-05 and 4E-02 M_earth, respectively. We show that\nall three planetary candidates may be stable in the mass range suggested in the\ndiscovery paper by Marois et al. 2008 (between 5 and 13 Jupiter masses), but\nonly for some of all possible orientations. Stable orbits imply a double\n(4:2:1) mean-motion resonance between all three companions.

Here we present a\nseries of three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of a self-regulating AGN\nin a galaxy cluster. Our adaptive-mesh simulations include prescriptions for\nradiative cooling, AGN heating and a subgrid model for RT-driven turbulence,\nwhich is crucial to simulate this evolution. AGN heating is taken to be\nproportional to the rest-mass energy that is accreted onto the central region\nof the cluster. For a wide range of feedback efficiencies, the cluster\nregulates itself for at least several $10^9$ years. Heating balances cooling\nthrough a string of outbursts with typical recurrence times of around 80 Myrs,\na timescale that depends only on global cluster properties.

The IMMP dynamics is shown to be an\ninterpolation between the exact Hamiltonian dynamics and the dynamics with\nrigid constraints. This property translates in the associated numerical\nintegrator into a tunable trade-off between stability and dynamical\nmodification. Moreover, a penalty that vanishes with the time-step yields order\ntwo convergent schemes for the exact dynamics.

As it turns out, its main advantage as an\nencoding format (namely, its requirement that all open and close markup tags\nare present and properly balanced) yield also one of its main disadvantages:\nverbosity. XML-conscious compression techniques seek to overcome this drawback.\nMany of these techniques first separate XML structure from the document\ncontent, and then compress each independently. Further compression gains can be\nrealized by identifying and compressing together document content that is\nhighly similar, thereby amortizing the storage costs of auxiliary information\nrequired by the chosen compression algorithm. Additionally, the proper choice\nof compression algorithm is an important factor not only for the achievable\ncompression gain, but also for access performance. Hence, choosing a\ncompression configuration that optimizes compression gain requires one to\ndetermine (1) a partitioning strategy for document content, and (2) the best\navailable compression algorithm to apply to each set within this partition. In\nthis paper, we show that finding an optimal compression configuration with\nrespect to compression gain is an NP-hard optimization problem. This problem\nremains intractable even if one considers a single compression algorithm for\nall content.

It is therefore appealing to search for\npossible signatures of the Sgr dSph contribution to the build-up of the\nGalactic disc.

This standard problem is known as NP-hard when delays\nare to be calculated. We propose here a reformulation, now expressed as a\nLinear-Programming (LP) problem, thus allowing to provide an efficient\nresolution. This allows us to \"back-engineer\" a neural network, i.e. to find\nout, given a set of initial conditions, which parameters (i.e., connection\nweights in this case), allow to simulate the network spike dynamics.

Here the latter model is studied\non a one-dimensional lattice of N sites with closed (zero flux) boundaries. In\nthis geometry the local particle conserving dynamics satisfies detailed balance\nwith respect to a canonical Gibbs measure with long range asymmetric pair\ninteractions. This generalizes results for the ring case, where detailed\nbalance holds, and in fact the steady state measure is known only for the case\nof equal densities of the different species: in the latter case the stationary\nstates of the system on a ring and on an interval are the same. We prove that\nin the N to infinity limit the scaled density profiles are given by (pieces of)\nthe periodic trajectory of a particle moving in a quartic confining potential.\nWe further prove uniqueness of the profiles, i.e., the existence of a single\nphase, in all regions of the parameter space (of average densities and\ntemperature) except at low temperature with all densities equal; in this case a\ncontinuum of phases, differing by translation, coexist. The results for the\nequal density case apply also to the system on the ring, and there extend\nresults of Clincy et al.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 May 2009 13:03:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 2009 17:54:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-20"}

The in-medium solution accounts for Pauli blocking\neffects, and for the $D$ and $D^*$ self-energies in a self-consistent manner.\nWe pay a special attention to the renormalization of the intermediate\npropagators in the medium beyond the usual cutoff scheme. We analyze the\nbehavior in the nuclear medium of the rich spectrum of dynamically-generated\nbaryonic resonances in the C=1 and S=0 sector, and their influence in the\nself-energy and, hence, the spectral function of the $D$ and $D^*$ mesons.

While below\nthe transition temperature, the solvent is in a glassy state, acting as a solid\ncrust around the protein, inhibiting any large scale conformational\nfluctuations. At the transition, most of the hydration shell unfreezes and\nwater molecules collectively make the protein more flexible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 May 2009 15:12:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 31 Jul 2010 10:49:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

We pay particular attention to the role of\ntopology of background gauge fields on the internal coset spaces, in this case\nU(1) magnetic monopoles and SU(2) instantons on CP(2). The reduction of\nYang-Mills theory induces a quiver gauge theory involving coupled\nYang-Mills-Higgs systems on M with a Higgs potential leading to dynamical\nsymmetry breaking. The criterion for a ground state of the Higgs potential can\nbe written as the vanishing of a non-abelian Yang-Mills flux on the quiver\ndiagram, regarded as a lattice with group elements attached to the links. The\nreduction of SU(3)-symmetric fermions yields Dirac fermions on M transforming\nunder the low-energy gauge group with Yukawa couplings. The fermionic zero\nmodes on CP(2) yield exactly massless chiral fermions on M, though there is a\nunique choice of spin(c) structure on CP(2) for which some of the zero modes\ncan acquire masses through Yukawa interactions.
