These theories have recourse\nto eikonals that encode information on both phase and amplitude -- in other\nwords, are complex-valued. The following mathematical principle is ultimately\nbehind the scenes: any geometric optical eikonal, which conventional rays\nengender in some light region, can be consistently continued in the shadow\nregion beyond the relevant caustic, provided an alternative eikonal, endowed\nwith a non-zero imaginary part, comes on stage. In the present paper we explore\nsuch a principle in dimension $2.$ We investigate a partial differential system\nthat governs the real and the imaginary parts of complex-valued two-dimensional\neikonals, and an initial value problem germane to it. In physical terms, the\nproblem in hand amounts to detecting waves that rise beside, but on the dark\nside of, a given caustic. In mathematical terms, such a problem shows two main\npeculiarities: on the one hand, degeneracy near the initial curve; on the other\nhand, ill-posedness in the sense of Hadamard.

We aim to model the\nphotometric granulation background of HD49933 as well as the Sun, and compare\nthe predictions to the measurements obtained by the COROT and SOHO satellite\nmissions. We construct hydrodynamical model atmospheres representing HD49933\nand the Sun, and use a previously developed scaling technique to obtain the\nobservable disk-integrated brightness fluctuations. We further performed\nexploratory magneto-hydrodynamical simulations to gauge the impact of small\nscale magnetic fields on the synthetic light-curves. We find that the\ngranulation-related brightness fluctuations depend on metallicity. We obtain a\nsatisfactory correspondence between prediction and observation for the Sun,\nvalidating our approach.

Locally generated\nmagnetic fields are unlikely to be responsible, otherwise existing fields would\nneed to be rather strong to sufficiently suppress the granulation signal.\nPresently suggested updates on the fundamental stellar parameters do not\nimprove the correspondence; however, an ad-hoc increase of the HD49933 surface\ngravity by about 0.2dex would eliminate most of the discrepancy.

FBA finds one of the alternate optimal solutions that maximizes the\nbiomass production rate. Almaas et al have shown that the flux distribution\nfollows a power law, and it is possible to associate with most metabolites two\nreactions which maximally produce and consume a give metabolite, respectively.\nThis observation led to the concept of high-flux backbone (HFB) in metabolic\nnetworks. In previous work, the HFB has been computed using a particular optima\nobtained using FBA. In this paper, we investigate the conservation of HFB of a\nparticular solution for a given medium across different alternate optima and\nnear-optima in metabolic networks of E. coli and S. cerevisiae. Using flux\nvariability analysis (FVA), we propose a method to determine reactions that are\nguaranteed to be in HFB regardless of alternate solutions. We find that the HFB\nof a particular optima is largely conserved across alternate optima in E. coli,\nwhile it is only moderately conserved in S. cerevisiae. However, the HFB of a\nparticular near-optima shows a large variation across alternate near-optima in\nboth organisms. We show that the conserved set of reactions in HFB across\nalternate near-optima has a large overlap with essential reactions and\nreactions which are both uniquely consuming (UC) and uniquely producing (UP).\nOur findings suggest that the structure of the metabolic network admits a high\ndegree of redundancy and plasticity in near-optimal flow patterns enhancing\nsystem robustness for a given environmental condition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 May 2009 00:41:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-19"}

We find that\ngeneric tunneling completely lifts the topological degeneracy of non-Abelian\nanyons. This degeneracy splitting is exponentially suppressed for long\ndistances between anyons, but leaves no topological protection at shorter\ndistances.
