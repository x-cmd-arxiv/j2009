Our model incorporates molecular hydrogen (H_2)\ncooling in low-mass systems and inhomogeneous photo-heating feedback during the\ninternal reionization of our own galaxy. We find that the existence of MW\nsatellites fainter than M_V ~ -5 is strong evidence for H_2 cooling in low-mass\nhalos, while satellites with -5 > M_V > -9 were affected by hydrogen cooling\nand photoheating feedback. The age of stars in very low-luminosity systems and\nthe minimum luminosity of these satellites are key predictions of our model.\nMost of the stars populating the brightest MW satellites could have formed\nafter the epoch of reionization.

However, accurate measurement of\ngalaxy shear is crucial and has been shown to be non-trivial by the Shear\nTEsting Programme. Here we demonstrate a fundamental limit to the accuracy\nachievable by model-fitting techniques, if oversimplistic models are used. We\nshow that even if galaxies have elliptical isophotes, model-fitting methods\nwhich assume elliptical isophotes can have significant biases if they use the\nwrong profile. We use noise-free simulations to show that on allowing\nsufficient flexibility in the profile the biases can be made negligible. This\nis no longer the case if elliptical isophote models are used to fit galaxies\nmade up of a bulge plus a disk, if these two components have different\nellipticities. The limiting accuracy is dependent on the galaxy shape but we\nfind the most significant biases for simple spiral-like galaxies. The\nimplications for a given cosmic shear survey will depend on the actual\ndistribution of galaxy morphologies in the universe, taking into account the\nsurvey selection function and the point spread function. However our results\nsuggest that the impact on cosmic shear results from current and near future\nsurveys may be negligible. Meanwhile, these results should encourage the\ndevelopment of existing approaches which are less sensitive to morphology, as\nwell as methods which use priors on galaxy shapes learnt from deep surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 May 2009 17:02:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The power of nearest interferer is used as a\nmajor performance indicator, instead of a traditionally-used total interference\npower, since at the low outage region, they have the same statistics so that\nthe former is an accurate approximation of the latter. This simplifies the\nproblem significantly and allows one to develop a unified framework for the\noutage probability analysis, including the impacts of complete/partial\ninterference cancelation, of different types of fading and of linear filtering,\neither alone or in combination with each other. When a given number of nearest\ninterferers are completely canceled, the outage probability is shown to scale\ndown exponentially in this number. Three different models of partial\ncancelation are considered and compared via their outage probabilities.

Here we show, using\n51 winters of re-analysis data, that the tropospheric temperature development\nrelative to stratospheric weak polar vortex events goes through a series of\nwell-defined stages, including geographically distinct cold air outbreaks. At\nthe inception of weak vortex events, a precursor signal in the form of a strong\nhigh-pressure anomaly is found over Northwest Europe. At the same time,\nlong-lived and robust cold anomalies appear over Asia and Western Europe. A few\nweeks later, near the mature stage of weak vortex events, a shorter-lived cold\nanomaly emerges off the east coast of North America.The probability of cold air\noutbreaks in different phases of the weak vortex life cycle increases by 40-70\n% in four key regions. This shows that the stratospheric polar vortex contains\ninformation that can be used to enhance forecasts of cold air outbreaks.\n300-year pre-industrial control runs of 11 state-of-the-art coupled climate\nmodels corroborate our results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 May 2009 21:41:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2009 06:09:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 8 Jun 2009 11:52:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}

One of the major open questions of quantum mechanics\nis what happens if non-commuting observables are measured simultaneously.

We formulate this problem in the context of measurements of\nfinite-frequency current cumulants in a general quantum point contact, which\nare the subject to ongoing experimental effort. To this end, we present two\nmodels of detectors that correspond to a weak time-resolved measurement of the\nelectronic current in a mesoscopic junction. In both cases, the backaction of\nthe detector leads to observable corrections to the current correlations\nfunctions involving the so-called noise susceptibilities. As a result, we\npropose a reinterpretation of environmental corrections to the finite-frequency\ncumulants as inevitable effect resulting from basic quantum mechanical\nprinciples.

Often the responses are suspected to share a common underlying\nstructure, in which case it may be advantageous to share information across\nthem; this is known as multitask learning. As a special case, we can use\nmultiple responses to better identify shared predictive features -- a project\nwe might call multitask feature selection.\n  This thesis is organized as follows. Section 1 introduces feature selection\nfor regression, focusing on ell_0 regularization methods and their\ninterpretation within a Minimum Description Length (MDL) framework. Section 2\nproposes a novel extension of MDL feature selection to the multitask setting.\nThe approach, called the \"Multiple Inclusion Criterion\" (MIC), is designed to\nborrow information across regression tasks by more easily selecting features\nthat are associated with multiple responses. We show in experiments on\nsynthetic and real biological data sets that MIC can reduce prediction error in\nsettings where features are at least partially shared across responses. Section\n3 surveys hypothesis testing by regression with a single response, focusing on\nthe parallel between the standard Bonferroni correction and an MDL approach.\nMirroring the ideas in Section 2, Section 4 proposes a novel MIC approach to\nhypothesis testing with multiple responses and shows that on synthetic data\nwith significant sharing of features across responses, MIC sometimes\noutperforms standard FDR-controlling methods in terms of finding true positives\nfor a given level of false positives. Section 5 concludes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 May 2009 03:41:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-02"}

Observation of high polarization in the\noptical emission of the hot spot indicates that the optical emission could be\nsynchrotron radiation of relativistic electrons in the hot spot. These\nelectrons may be able to produce high energy gamma-ray photons through inverse\nCompton (IC) scattering. We use single-zone and multi-zone synchrotron +\nsynchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) models to fit the observed spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) from the radio to the X-ray band of the hot spot. Our esults\nshow that in the case of a much weaker magnetic field strength than the\nequipartition magnetic field, both the single-zone and multi-zone models can\nfit the SED, but the multi-zone model significantly improves the fit. The two\nmodels predict the hot spot as a GeV-TeV source, which might be marginally\ndetectable with Fermi/LAT and HESS. The inverse Compton scattering of cosmic\nmicrowave background (IC/CMB) is also considered, but its contribution to\nGeV-TeV emission is negligible.

Based on a variety of dust-collision\nexperiments in the laboratory, our view of the growth of dust aggregates in\nprotoplanetary disks is now supported by a deeper understanding of the physics\ninvolved in the interaction between dust agglomerates. However, the parameter\nspace, which determines the collisional outcome, is huge and sometimes\ninaccessible to laboratory experiments. Very large or fluffy dust aggregates\nand extremely low collision velocities are beyond the boundary of today's\nlaboratories. It is therefore desirable to augment our empirical knowledge of\ndust-collision physics with a numerical method to treat arbitrary aggregate\nsizes, porosities and collision velocities. In this article, we implement\nexperimentally-determined material parameters of highly porous dust aggregates\ninto a Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code, in particular an\nomnidirectional compressive-strength and a tensile-strength relation. We also\ngive a prescription of calibrating the SPH code with compression and\nlow-velocity impact experiments. In the process of calibration, we developed a\ndynamic compressive-strength relation and estimated a relation for the shear\nstrength. Finally, we defined and performed a series of benchmark tests and\nfound the agreement between experimental results and numerical simulations to\nbe very satisfactory. SPH codes have been used in the past to study collisions\nat rather high velocities. At the end of this work, we show examples of future\napplications in the low-velocity regime of collisional evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 May 2009 15:08:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-24"}

Among other things, this\nresult will depend on the boundary conditions and the dimension D of the\nsystem. We investigate this question for scalar and abelian gauge fields under\nboundary conditions that obey the symmetries of the action. We apply our\nfindings to the Casimir piston, an ideal system for detecting boundary effects.\nOur investigation is not limited to extra dimensions and we show that the\noriginal piston scenario proposed in 2004, a toy model involving a scalar field\nin 3D (2+1)dimensions, can be obtained via dimensional reduction from a more\nrealistic 4D electromagnetic (EM) system. We show that for perfect conductor\nconditions, a D-dimensional EM field reduces to a D-1 scalar field and not its\nlower-dimensional version. For Dirichlet boundary conditions, no theory is\nrecovered under dimensional reduction and the Casimir pressure goes to zero in\nany dimension. This \"zero Dirichlet\" result is useful for understanding the EM\ncase. We then identify two special systems where the lower-dimensional version\nis recovered in any dimension: systems with perfect magnetic conductor (PMC)\nand Neumann boundary conditions. We show that these two boundary conditions can\nbe obtained from a variational procedure in which the action vanishes outside\nthe bounded region. The fields are free to vary on the surface and have zero\nmodes which survive after dimensional reduction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 May 2009 15:19:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-24"}
