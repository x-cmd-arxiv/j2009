We study the production of\nheavy lepton pairs in SM extensions with: (i) a Majorana or Dirac lepton\ntriplet, as those appearing in type-III seesaw; (ii) a lepton isodoublet\n(N,E)_{L,R}; (iii) a charged isosinglet E_{L,R}; (iv) a Majorana or Dirac\nneutrino singlet N and an additional Z' gauge boson. It is shown that the\ntrilepton final state l+-l+-l-+, which has a small SM background, constitutes\nthe golden channel for heavy neutrino searches, being very sensitive to\nMajorana or Dirac neutrinos in triplet, doublet or singlet SU(2)_L\nrepresentations. For higher luminosities, signals in this final state can also\ndistinguish lepton triplets from doublets and singlets. The Majorana or Dirac\nnature of the heavy neutrinos is revealed by the presence or not of like-sign\ndilepton l+-l+- signals without significant missing energy. Notably, l+-l+-\nsignals but with large missing energy are characteristic of Dirac triplets,\ndistinguishing them from the other two models with a heavy Dirac neutrino.\nFurther discrimination is achieved with the analysis of the clean l+l+l-l-\nfinal state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 May 2009 17:34:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2009 22:00:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-22"}

In a study of flavor structure in\nthe lepton sector, however, an important role is played by right-handed\nneutrinos, which are not charged under the SU(5) unified gauge group. It is\ntherefore solicited to find out what right-handed neutrinos are in F-theory\ncompactifications and how their Majorana mass terms are generated together with\ndeveloping a theoretical framework where effective Yukawa couplings involving\nboth SU(5)-neutral and charged fields can be calculated. We find that the\ncomplex structure moduli chiral multiplets of F-theory compactifications are\ngood candidates to be right-handed neutrinos, and that their Majorana masses\nare automatically generated in flux compactifications.

Additionally, we have found that, in a very thin disc, an\napsidal resonance is observed in the system if the Super-Earth is captured in\nthe trap. Moreover, the eccentricity of the small planet remains low, while\nthat of the gas giant increases slightly due to the imbalance between Lindblad\nand corotational resonances. We have also studied analogous systems in which\nthe gas giant is allowed to take Sub-Jupiter masses. In this case, after\nperforming an extensive survey over all possible parameters, we have succeeded\nin getting the 1:2 mean motion resonant configuration only in a disc with low\naspect ratio and low surface density.

We estimate dynamical measures\nlike torque strength for bar and spiral, and also the total nonaxisymmetric\ntorque. We explore the interplay between the spiral and bar components of\ngalaxies. Both the length and the contrast of the Fourier bars decrease along\nthe morphological sequence Sb-Sbc-Sc, with bars in earlier types being longer\nand showing higher contrast. Bars of Sb galaxies are ~3x longer than bars in Sc\ntypes. We find that longer bars are not necessarily stronger (as quantified by\nthe torque Q_{b} measure), but longer bars show a higher contrast, in very good\nagreement with theoretical predictions. Our data suggests that bar and spiral\ncomponents are rather independent in the sense that the torque strengths of the\ntwo components are not correlated. The total strength Q_{g} is a very reliable\ntracer of the bar strength Q_{b}, the two quantities showing a very tight\nlinear correlation. Comparison with a similar sample of disk galaxies extracted\nfrom the OSUBGS indicates that the isolated CIG/AMIGA galaxies host\nsignificantly longer Fourier bars and possibly show a different distribution of\nspiral torque Q_{s}. The Fourier analysis also revealed a potential case of\ncounterwinding spiral structure (NGC 5768), which deserves further kinematic\nstudy.

However,\nwe also observe a \"flip\" in the direction of the gradient between June 2000 and\nAugust 2002. Although the origins of this phenomena are not entirely clear,\npossibly explanations include (i) the sense of rotation of the central\nsupermassive black hole and accretion disc has remained the same, but the\ndominant magnetic pole facing the Earth has changed from North to South; (ii) a\nchange in the direction of the azimuthal B field component as a result of\ntorsional oscillations of the jet; and (iii) a change in the relative\ncontributions to the observed rotation measures of the \"inner\" and \"outer\"\nhelical fields in a magnetic-tower model. Although we cannot entirely rule out\nthe possibility that the observed changes in the RM distribution are associated\ninstead with changes in the thermal-electron distribution in the vicinity of\nthe jet, we argue that this explanation is unlikely.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 May 2009 16:12:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The most\npowerful jets are thought to derive a significant fraction, if not the\nmajority, of their power from the rotational energy of the black hole. Whatever\nthe precise mechanism that causes them, these jets must therefore exert a\nbraking torque on the black hole. We calculate the spin-up function for an\naccreting black hole, accounting for this braking torque. We find that the\npredicted black hole spin-up function depends only on the black hole spin and\ndimensionless parameters describing the accretion flow. Using recent\nrelativistic magnetohydrodynamical numerical simulation results to calibrate\nthe efficiency of angular momentum transfer in the flow, we find that an ADAF\nflow will spin a black hole up (or down) to an equilibrium value of about 96%\nof the maximal spin value in the absence of jets. Combining our ADAF system\nwith a simple model for jet power, we demonstrate that an equilibrium is\nreached at approximately 93% of the maximal spin value, as found in the\nnumerical simulation studies of the spin-up of accreting black holes, at which\npoint the spin-up of the hole by accreted material is balanced by the braking\ntorque arising from jet production. Our model also yields a relationship\nbetween jet efficiency and black hole spin that is in surprisingly good\nagreement with that seen in the simulation studies, indicating that our simple\nmodel is a useful and convenient description of ADAF inflow - jet outflow about\na spinning black hole for incorporation in models of the formation and\nevolution of galaxies, groups and clusters of galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 May 2009 16:57:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2009 19:11:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

A number of transverse FR gradients have been\nfound, and interpreted as corresponding to helical magnetic fields wrapped\naround the jets; the gradients reflect the systematic change in the\nline-of-sight component of a toroidal or helical magnetic field across the jet\n(e.g Gabuzda, Murray & Cronin 2004). Our observations of a sample of BL Lac\nobjects at six wavelengths near 2, 4 and 6 cm have also revealed a previously\nundetected phenomena: these transverse gradients sometimes change their\ndirection with distance from the core. We have observed this behaviour in at\nleast five sources, which display gradients in their VLBI core region opposite\nto those in the jet. We suggest that this may be linked to magnetic tower\nmodels. In magnetic tower models, the field lines go outward with the jet and\nreturn and close in the accretion disk (or vice versa); differential rotation\nof the accretion disk winds up the inner and outer field lines into two helices\n(the inner helix \"nested\" in the outer helix). The total observed FR gradient\nis a sum of the effect of these two helical fields. It may be that gradients\ndetected relatively far from the core correspond to the outer helix, while\ngradients detected in the core region correspond to dominance of the inner\nhelix. This provides tentative evidence for the unification of helical magnetic\nfields and magnetic tower models, which could provide crucial new information\nfor understanding AGN jets. Further VLBI studies with resolution sufficient to\nreliably detect these gradients in the cm-wavelength core and inner jet will be\nimportant for further investigations of this phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 May 2009 16:59:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-15"}

We analyze the issue of \"particle\nmotion\" in classical electromagnetism in a rigorous and systematic way by\nconsidering a one-parameter family of solutions to the coupled Maxwell and\nmatter equations corresponding to having a body whose charge-current density\n$J^a(\\lambda)$ and stress-energy tensor $T_{ab} (\\lambda)$ scale to zero size\nin an asymptotically self-similar manner about a worldline $\\gamma$ as $\\lambda\n\\to 0$. In this limit, the charge, $q$, and total mass, $m$, of the body go to\nzero, and $q/m$ goes to a well defined limit. The Maxwell field\n$F_{ab}(\\lambda)$ is assumed to be the retarded solution associated with\n$J^a(\\lambda)$ plus a homogeneous solution (the \"external field\") that varies\nsmoothly with $\\lambda$. We prove that the worldline $\\gamma$ must be a\nsolution to the Lorentz force equations of motion in the external field\n$F_{ab}(\\lambda=0)$. We then obtain self-force, dipole forces, and spin force\nas first order perturbative corrections to the center of mass motion of the\nbody. We believe that this is the first rigorous derivation of the complete\nfirst order correction to Lorentz force motion. We also address the issue of\nobtaining a self-consistent perturbative equation of motion associated with our\nperturbative result, and argue that the self-force equations of motion that\nhave previously been written down in conjunction with the \"reduction of order\"\nprocedure should provide accurate equations of motion for a sufficiently small\ncharged body with negligible dipole moments and spin.

We use an ensemble of N-body\nsimulations to directly follow the potentials and compare results to\nperturbation theory (PT). The predictions from PT match the results to high\nprecision for k<0.2 h/Mpc. We compute the nonlinear corrections to the angular\npower spectrum and find them to be <10% of linear theory for l<100. These\ncorrections are swamped by cosmic variance. On scales l>100 the departures are\nmore significant, however the CMB signal is more than a factor 10^3 larger at\nthis scale. Nonlinear ISW effects therefore play no role in shaping the CMB\npower spectrum for l<1500. We analyze the CMB--density tracer cross-spectrum\nusing simulations and renormalized bias PT, and find good agreement. The usual\nassumption is that nonlinear evolution enhances the growth of structure and\ncounteracts linear ISW on small scales, leading to a change in sign of the\nCMB-LSS cross-spectrum at small scales. However, PT analysis suggests that this\ntrend reverses at late times when the logarithmic growth rate\nf(a)=dlnD/dlna<0.5 or om_m(a)<0.3. Numerical results confirm these expectations\nand we find no sign change in ISW-LSS cross-power for low redshifts.\nCorrections due to nonlinearity and scale dependence of the bias are found to\nbe <10% for l<100, therefore below the S/N of the current and future\nmeasurements. Finally, we estimate the CMB--halo cross-correlation coefficient\nand show that it can be made to match that for CMB--dark matter to within 5%\nfor thin redshift shells, mitigating the need to model bias evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 2009 09:15:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 May 2009 10:41:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

At z ~ 2.6, the observed number and mass\ndensity of quiescent red galaxies with M > 4x10^10 Msun is consistent with the\nmodel in which every quiescent massive galaxy underwent a quasar phase in the\npast.

This\n\"participatory journalism\" of blogs has such an impact upon the masses that\nKeller and Berry argued that through blogging \"one American in tens tells the\nother nine how to vote, where to eat and what to buy\" \\cite{keller1}.\nTherefore, a significant issue is how to identify such influential bloggers.\nThis problem is very new and the relevant literature lacks sophisticated\nsolutions, but most importantly these solutions have not taken into account\ntemporal aspects for identifying influential bloggers, even though the time is\nthe most critical aspect of the Blogosphere. This article investigates the\nissue of identifying influential bloggers by proposing two easily computed\nblogger ranking methods, which incorporate temporal aspects of the blogging\nactivity. Each method is based on a specific metric to score the blogger's\nposts. The first metric, termed MEIBI, takes into consideration the number of\nthe blog post's inlinks and its comments, along with the publication date of\nthe post. The second metric, MEIBIX, is used to score a blog post according to\nthe number and age of the blog post's inlinks and its comments. These methods\nare evaluated against the state-of-the-art influential blogger identification\nmethod utilizing data collected from a real-world community blog site.

Various\napproaches have been proposed in the literature to identify time delays\nintroduced by multipath environments. However, these methods either operate on\nthe analog received signal, or require high sampling rates in order to achieve\nreasonable time resolution. In this paper, our goal is to develop a unified\napproach to time delay estimation from low rate samples of the output of a\nmultipath channel. Our methods result in perfect recovery of the multipath\ndelays from samples of the channel output at the lowest possible rate, even in\nthe presence of overlapping transmitted pulses. This rate depends only on the\nnumber of multipath components and the transmission rate, but not on the\nbandwidth of the probing signal. In addition, our development allows for a\nvariety of different sampling methods. By properly manipulating the low-rate\nsamples, we show that the time delays can be recovered using the well-known\nESPRIT algorithm. Combining results from sampling theory with those obtained in\nthe context of direction of arrival estimation methods, we develop necessary\nand sufficient conditions on the transmitted pulse and the sampling functions\nin order to ensure perfect recovery of the channel parameters at the minimal\npossible rate.

The\naveraging of local inhomogeneities in general relativity can lead to\nsignificant dynamical effects on the evolution of the universe and on the\ninterpretation of cosmological data. In particular, all deductions about\ncosmology are based on light paths; averaging can have an important effect on\nphoton propagation and hence cosmological observations. It would be desirable\nto describe the physical effects of averaging in terms of observational\nquantities and focussing on the behaviour of light. Data (e.g., matter terms,\nsuch as the density or galaxy number counts, which are already expressed as\naveraged quantities) is given on the null cone. Therefore, it is\nobservationally meaningful to consider light-cone averages of quantities. In\nprinciple, we wish to describe the cosmological equations on the null cone, and\nhence we need to construct the averaged geometry on the null cone. However, we\nargue that it is still necessary to average the full Einstein field equations\nto obtain suitably averaged equations on the null cone.

We illustrate how to extend our lower bound\ntechnique to compositions of linear algebra operations (like computing powers\nof a matrix), to decide whether it is enough to call a sequence of simpler\noptimal algorithms (like matrix multiplication) to minimize communication, or\nif we can do better. We give examples of both. We also show how to extend our\nlower bounds to certain graph theoretic problems.\n  We point out recently designed algorithms for dense LU, Cholesky, QR,\neigenvalue and the SVD problems that attain these lower bounds; implementations\nof LU and QR show large speedups over conventional linear algebra algorithms in\nstandard libraries like LAPACK and ScaLAPACK. Many open problems remain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 2009 07:26:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-20"}

However,\nin the Poincare space, the effect is 10,000 times weaker still, i.e. the\nPoincare space is about 10^{10} times \"better balanced\" than ill-proportioned\nspaces. Both observations and weak limit dynamics select the Poincare space to\nbe special.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 2009 13:12:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-17"}

In this essay, we\nask: What are the observational signatures, if the scalar field is a spinor\ncondensate? and Is there a way to distinguish between the canonical scalar\nfield and the spinor condensate driven models? In the homogeneous and isotropic\nbackground, we show that, although the dark-spinor (Elko) condensate leads to\nthe identical acceleration equation as that of the canonical scalar field\ndriven inflation, the dynamics of the two models are different. In the\nslow-roll limit, we show that the model, predicts a running of scalar spectral\nindex consistent with the WMAP data. We show that the consistency relations\nbetween the spinor condensate and canonical scalar field driven model are\ndifferent which can be tested using the future CMB and gravitational wave\nmissions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 2009 15:53:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 May 2009 15:31:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 2010 05:34:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}
