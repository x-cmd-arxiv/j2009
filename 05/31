W. Bridgman\n(PWB) is the father of modern high-pressure physics. What is not generally\nrecognized is that Bridgman was also intimately connected with establishing\nshock compression as a scientific tool and he predicted major events in shock\nresearch that occurred up to 40 years after his death. In 1956 the first phase\ntransition under shock compression was reported in Fe at 13 GPa (130 kbar). PWB\nsaid a phase transition could not occur in a ~microsec, thus setting off a\ncontroversy. The scientific legitimacy of shock compression resulted 5 years\nlater when static high-pressure researchers confirmed with x-ray diffraction\nthe existence of epsilon-Fe. Once PWB accepted the fact that shock waves\ngenerated with chemical explosives were a valid scientific tool, he immediately\nrealized that substantially higher pressures would be achieved with nuclear\nexplosives. He included his ideas for achieving higher pressures in articles\npublished a few years after his death. L. V. Altshuler eventually read Bridgman\narticles and pursued the idea of using nuclear explosives to generate super\nhigh pressures, which subsequently morphed today into giant lasers. PWB also\nanticipated combining static and shock methods, which today is done with\npre-compression of a soft sample in a diamond anvil cell followed by\nlaser-driven shock compression. One variation of that method is the\nreverberating-shock technique, in which the first shock pre-compresses a soft\nsample and subsequent reverberations isentropically compress the first-shocked\nstate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 May 2009 19:24:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

For\nthis reason, algorithms that can make inferences by looking at the topology of\na network are desirable. In this work, we are particular interested in the\nquestion of whether a given pathway can potentially harbor multiple stable\nsteady states. In other words, the challenge is to find the set of parameters\nsuch that the dynamical system defined by a set of ordinary differential\nequations will contain multiple stable steady states. Being able to find\nparameters that cause a network to be bistable may also be benefitial for\nengineering synthetic bistable systems where the engineer needs to know a\nworking set of parameters.\n  Result: We have developed an algorithm that optimizes the parameters of a\ndynamical system so that the system will contain at least one saddle or\nunstable point. The algorithm then looks at trajectories around this saddle or\nunstable point to see whether the different trajectories converge to different\nstable points. The algorithm returns the parameters that causes the system to\nexhibit multiple stable points. Since this is an optimization algorithm, it is\nnot quaranteed to find a solution. Repeated runs are often required to find a\nsolution for systems where only a narrow set of parameters exhibit bistability.\n  Availability: The C code for the algorithm is available at\nhttp://tinkercell.googlecode.com\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 May 2009 21:33:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 2009 15:59:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-23"}

The first step\ntowards understanding these networks is finding an adequate network model that\nclosely replicates their structure. Evaluating the fit of a model to the data\nrequires comparing the model with real-world networks. Since network\ncomparisons are computationally infeasible, they rely on heuristics, or\n\"network properties.\" We show that it is difficult to assess the reliability of\nthe fit of a model with any individual network property. Thus, our approach\nintegrates a variety of network properties and further combines these with a\nseries of probabilistic methods to predict an appropriate network model for\nbiological networks. We find geometric random graphs, that model spatial\nrelationships between objects, to be the best-fitting model for RIGs.

This\nresonance results when cancelation occurs between two phase differences, the\nusual kinematic one coming from the neutrino mass-squared difference, and a\ngeometric one coming from the difference in travel times of the sterile\nneutrino through the bulk relative to the active neutrino confined to the\nbrane. In this work we introduce a specific metric for the brane-bulk system,\nfrom which we explicitly derive extra-dimensional geodesics for the sterile\nneutrino, and ultimately the oscillation probability of the active-sterile\ntwo-state system. We find that for an asymmetrically-warped metric, the\nresonance condition involves both the neutrino energy E and the travel distance\nL on the brane. In other words, the resonant energy may be viewed as\nbaseline-dependent. We show that to a good approximation, the resonance\ncondition is not on E or on L, but rather on the product LE. The model is rich\nin implications, including the possibility of multiple solutions to the\nresonance condition, with ramifications for existing data sets, e.g., LSND and\nMiniBooNE.

Mainly short times for\nwhich the numerical calculations can be performed accurately are considered.\nLong time calculations are presented as well. In particular the subdiffusive\nbehavior where the average second moment of the wavepacket is of the form\n<m_{2}>~t^a is computed. Contrary to former heuristic arguments, no evidence\nfor any critical behavior as function of \"p\" is found. The properties of\n\\alpha(t) are explored.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 May 2009 15:32:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-30"}
