This conceptual framework is first applied to the history of\nthe 80-cm telescope of Toulouse Observatory, which is initially anchored in a\ngeneral-purpose regime linked to astrometry. After a transition in the 1930s,\nit is integrated in a dedicated regime centered on astrophysics. This evolution\nis compared to that of a very similar instrument, the 80-cm telescope of\nMarseille Observatory, which converts early on to the dedicated regime with the\nFabry-Perot interferometer around 1910, and, after a period of idleness, is\nagain used in the survey mode after WWII. To further validate our new concept,\nwe apply it to the telescopes of Washburn Observatory, of Dominion\nAstrophysical Observatory and of Meudon Observatory. The uses of the different\ntelescopes illustrate various combinations of the two regimes, which can be\nsuccessive, simultaneous or alternating.

Parameterizing the merger fraction evolution with redshift as f_m(z) =\nf_m(0) (1+z)^m, we find that m = 1.8 +/- 0.5 for M_B <= -20 galaxies, while m =\n5.4 +/- 0.4 for M_star >= 10^10 M_Sun galaxies.

In the small-amplitude limit, before any\ntransient accretion disk is formed, the oscillation period of the accretion\nshock is comparable to the Keplerian period at the Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion\nradius (R_a), independent of the size of the accreting object. The growth rate\nof the overstability increases dramatically with decreasing size of the\naccretor, but is relatively insensitive to the upstream Mach number of the\nflow.

In seeking to resolve\nthis problem, one naturally wonders if the real world can somehow be\ninterpreted as an inflating de Sitter brane embedded in a higher-dimensional\nspacetime described by warped geometry. In this scenario, the four-dimensional\ncosmological constant may be uniquely determined in terms of two length scales:\none is a scale associated with the size of extra dimensions and the other is a\nscale associated with the expansion rate of our universe. In some specific\ncases, these two scales are complementary to each other. This result is\ndemonstrated here by presenting some explicit and completely non-singular de\nSitter space dS$_4$ solutions of vacuum Einstein equations in five and ten\ndimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 May 2009 22:22:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2009 04:39:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 23 Oct 2009 06:13:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-23"}

We emphasize that the MHz radiation appears\nearlier than the kHz in both laboratory and geophysical scale. An important\nchallenge in this field of research is to distinguish characteristic epochs in\nthe evolution of precursory EM activity and identify them with the equivalent\nlast stages in the earthquake (EQ) preparation process. Recently, we proposed\nthe following two epochs/stages model: (i) The second epoch, which includes the\nfinally emerged strong impulsive kHz EM emission is due to the fracture of the\nhigh strength large asperities that are distributed along the activated fault\nsustaining the system. (ii) The first epoch, which includes the initially\nemerged MHz EM radiation is thought to be due to the fracture of a highly\nheterogeneous system that surrounds the family of asperities. A catastrophic EQ\nof magnitude Mw = 6.3 occurred on 06/04/2009 in central Italy. The majority of\nthe damage occurred in the city of L'Aquila. Clear kHz - MHz EM anomalies have\nbeen detected prior to the L'Aquila EQ. Herein, we investigate the seismogenic\norigin of the detected MHz anomaly. The analysis in terms of intermittent\ndynamics of critical fluctuations reveals that the candidate EM precursor: (i)\ncan be described in analogy with a thermal continuous phase transition; (ii)\nhas anti-persistent behaviour. These features suggest that the emerged\ncandidate precursor could be triggered by microfractures in the highly\ndisordered system that surrounded the backbone of asperities of the activated\nfault. We introduce a criterion for an underlying strong critical behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2009 12:51:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The intercept of the regression for the nebular data virtually\ncoincides with the intercept obtained from the stellar data. This allows little\nroom for depletion of nebular oxygen onto dust grains, although in this kind of\ncomparison we are somewhat limited by systematic uncertainties, such as those\nrelated to the atomic parameters used to derive the chemical compositions.\n  We discuss the implications of our result with regard to strong-line\nabundance indicators commonly used to estimate the chemical compositions of\nstar-forming galaxies, such as R23. By applying a few popular calibrations of\nthese indices based on grids of photoionization models on the NGC 300 HII\nregion fluxes we find metallicities that are higher by 0.3 dex (a factor of\ntwo) or more relative to our nebular (Te-based) and stellar ones.\n  We confirm a metallicity dependence of the `softness' parameter\neta=(O+/O++)/(S+/S++), in the sense that softer stellar continua are found at\nhigh metallicity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2009 03:07:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-22"}

Considering an (anti-)D3-brane\nsitting at the throat tip as a prototype standard model brane, we show that the\nbrane's position in the isometry directions can play the role of curvatons. The\nbasic picture is that the fluctuations of the (anti-)D3-brane in the angular\nisometry directions during inflation eventually turns into the primordial\ncurvature perturbations, and subsequently the brane's oscillation excites other\nopen string modes on the brane and reheat the universe. We find in the explicit\ncase of the KS throat that a wide range of parameters allows a consistent\ncurvaton scenario. It is also shown that the oscillations of branes at throat\ntips are capable of producing large non-Gaussianity, either through curvature\nor isocurvature perturbations. Since such setups naturally arise in warped\n(multi-)throat compactifications and are constrained by observational data, the\nmodel can provide tests for compactification scenarios. This work gives an\nexplicit example of string theory providing light fields for generating\ncurvature perturbations. Such mechanisms free the inflaton from being\nresponsible for the perturbations, thus open up new possibilities for inflation\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2009 09:04:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2009 16:52:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-21"}

At\npresent, little is known about how cortical growth affects the development of\nneuronal circuits. Here, in acute and chronic experiments, we study the layout\nof ocular dominance (OD) columns in cat primary visual cortex (V1) during a\nperiod of substantial postnatal growth. We find that despite a considerable\nsize increase of V1, the spacing between columns is largely preserved. In\ncontrast, their spatial arrangement changes systematically over this period.\nWhile in young animals columns are more band-like, layouts become more\nisotropic in mature animals. We propose a novel mechanism of growth-induced\nreorganization that is based on the `zigzag instability', a dynamical\ninstability observed in several inanimate pattern forming systems. We argue\nthat this mechanism is inherent to a wide class of models for the\nactivity-dependent formation of OD columns. Analyzing one member of this class,\nthe Elastic Network model, we show that this mechanism can account for the\npreservation of column spacing and the specific mode of reorganization of OD\ncolumns that we observe. We conclude that neurons systematically shift their\nselectivities during normal development and that this reorganization is induced\nby the cortical expansion during growth.

Here we investigate the redshift evolution of\nthe orbits of cluster galaxies using two samples of galaxy clusters spanning\nsimilar (evolutionary corrected) mass ranges at different redshifts. The\nlow-redshift (z~0.0-0.1) sample is extracted from the ENACS catalog and the\nhigh-redshift (z~0.4-0.8) sample is mostly made of clusters from the EDisCS.\nFor each of these samples, we solve the Jeans equation for hydrostatic\nequilibrium separately for two cluster galaxy populations, characterized by the\npresence and, respectively, absence of emission-lines in their spectra ('ELGs'\nand 'nELGs' hereafter). Using two tracers of the gravitational potential allows\nto partially break the well known mass-velocity anisotropy degeneracy.\n  We find no significant evolution for the orbits of ELGs. On the other hand\nthe orbits of nELGs do evolve, from radial to isotropic with time. We speculate\nthat this evolution may be driven by the secular mass growth of galaxy clusters\nduring their fast accretion phase. The mass density profiles of the clusters\nare well fit by NFW models both in the low-z and in the high-z samples. The\nbest-fit NFW concentrations and their redshift evolution are in agreement with\nthe predictions of Lambda CDM cosmological simulations. The evolution of the\nnumber density profile of nELGs is opposite to that of the mass density\nprofile, becoming less concentrated with time, probably a result of the\ntransformation of ELGs into nELGs [abridged].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2009 10:47:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2009 11:16:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2009 09:22:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Subtraction of the known resolved point\nsources leads to detectable levels of unresolved emission in the core region of\nM28, NGC 6440, M62, and NGC 6752. The X-ray luminosities in the 0.3-8 keV\nenergy band of this emission component were found to lie in the range $\\sim 1.5\n\\times 10^{31}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ (NGC 6752) to $\\sim 2.2 \\times 10^{32}$ ergs\ns$^{-1}$ (M28). The lowest limiting luminosity for X-ray source detections\namongst these four clusters was $1.1 \\times 10^{30}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ for NGC\n6752. The spectrum of the unresolved emission can be fit equally well by a\npower-law, a thermal bremsstrahlung model, a black body plus power-law, or a\nthermal bremsstrahlung model plus black body component. The unresolved emission\nis considered to arise from the cumulative contribution of active binaries,\ncataclysmic variables, and faint millisecond pulsars with their associated\npulsar wind nebulae. In examining the available X-ray data, no evidence for any\npulsar wind nebular emission in globular clusters is found. It is shown that\nthe X-ray luminosity contribution of a faint source population based on an\nextrapolation of the luminosity function of detected point sources is\ncompatible with the unresolved X-ray emission in the cores of NGC 6440 and NGC\n6752. Adopting the same slope for the luminosity function for M62 as for NGC\n6440 and NGC 6752 leads to a similar result for M62. For M28, the contribution\nfrom faint sources in the core can attain a level comparable with the observed\nvalue if a steeper slope is adopted. The characteristics on the faint source\npopulation as constrained by the properties of the unresolved X-ray emission\nare briefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2009 15:08:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-22"}

When the atomistic energy is approximated by a hybrid energy that\ncouples atomistic and continuum models, the accuracy of the approximation can\nonly be guaranteed near deformations where both the atomistic energy as well as\nthe hybrid energy are stable. We propose, therefore, that it is essential for\nthe evaluation of the predictive capability of atomistic-to-continuum coupling\nmethods near instabilities that a theoretical analysis be performed, at least\nfor some representative model problems, that determines whether the hybrid\nenergies remain stable {\\em up to the onset of instability of the atomistic\nenergy}. We formulate a one-dimensional model problem with nearest and\nnext-nearest neighbor interactions and use rigorous analysis, asymptotic\nmethods, and numerical experiments to obtain such sharp stability estimates for\nthe basic conservative quasicontinuum (QC) approximations. Our results show\nthat the consistent quasi-nonlocal QC approximation correctly reproduces the\nstability of the atomistic system, whereas the inconsistent energy-based QC\napproximation incorrectly predicts instability at a significantly reduced\napplied load that we describe by an analytic criterion in terms of the\nderivatives of the atomistic potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2009 15:38:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Jul 2009 16:00:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2010 10:00:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}
