While increasing\nthe cell level is easy, reducing the level of a cell can be accomplished only\nby erasing an entire block. Since block erasures are highly undesirable, coding\nschemes - known as floating codes or flash codes - have been designed in order\nto maximize the number of times that information stored in a flash memory can\nbe written (and re-written) prior to incurring a block erasure. An (n,k,t)_q\nflash code C is a coding scheme for storing k information bits in n cells in\nsuch a way that any sequence of up to t writes (where a write is a transition 0\n-> 1 or 1 -> 0 in any one of the k bits) can be accommodated without a block\nerasure. The total number of available level transitions in n cells is n(q-1),\nand the write deficiency of C, defined as \\delta(C) = n(q-1) - t, is a measure\nof how close the code comes to perfectly utilizing all these transitions. For k\n> 6 and large n, the best previously known construction of flash codes achieves\na write deficiency of O(qk^2). On the other hand, the best known lower bound on\nwrite deficiency is \\Omega(qk). In this paper, we present a new construction of\nflash codes that approaches this lower bound to within a factor logarithmic in\nk. To this end, we first improve upon the so-called \"indexed\" flash codes, due\nto Jiang and Bruck, by eliminating the need for index cells in the Jiang-Bruck\nconstruction. Next, we further increase the number of writes by introducing a\nnew multi-stage (recursive) indexing scheme. We then show that the write\ndeficiency of the resulting flash codes is O(qk\\log k) if q \\geq \\log_2k, and\nat most O(k\\log^2 k) otherwise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 May 2009 22:36:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-12"}

We discuss the possibility and theoretical aspects\nof using Lyman alpha emission properties of long GRB host galaxies as a\nmetallicity indicator of high redshift GRB environments, where direct\nmetallicity measurements are not easy. We propose to use the fraction of\nLy-alpha emitters (LAEs) in long GRB host galaxies as a function of UV\nluminosity, which can be compared with star-formation-rate weighted LAE\nfraction of Lyman-break galaxies as the standard in the case of no metallicity\ndependence. There are two important effects of metallicity dependence of long\nGRB rate to change the LAE fraction of host galaxies. One is the enhancement of\nintrinsic Ly-alpha equivalent width (EW) by stronger ionizing UV luminosity of\nlow metallicity stellar population, and the other is extinction by interstellar\ndust to change the observable EW. Based on a latest theoretical model of LAEs\nthat reproduce observations, we argue that the latter is likely to work in the\nopposite direction to the former, i.e., to decrease LAE fraction if GRBs\npreferentially occur in low-metallicity environments, because of the clumpy\ninter-stellar medium effect. The high LAE fraction of GRB host galaxies\nindicated by observations is quantitatively be explained by the LAE model if\nGRBs occur when Z < 0.1Z_sun, although this result is still indicative because\nof the limited statistics and theoretical uncertainties.

Such a problem can be viewed as an\ninformation-theoretic variant of the well-studied matrix completion problem,\nand the main objective is to design an efficient algorithm that can reconstruct\na matrix by inspecting only a small number of its entries. Although this is an\nimpossible task in general, Cand\\`es and co-authors have recently shown that\nunder a so-called incoherence assumption, a rank $r$ $n\\times n$ matrix can be\nreconstructed using semidefinite programming (SDP) after one inspects\n$O(nr\\log^6n)$ of its entries. In this paper we propose an alternative approach\nthat is much more efficient and can reconstruct a larger class of matrices by\ninspecting a significantly smaller number of the entries. Specifically, we\nfirst introduce a class of so-called stable matrices and show that it includes\nall those that satisfy the incoherence assumption. Then, we propose a\nrandomized basis pursuit (RBP) algorithm and show that it can reconstruct a\nstable rank $r$ $n\\times n$ matrix after inspecting $O(nr\\log n)$ of its\nentries. Our sampling bound is only a logarithmic factor away from the\ninformation-theoretic limit and is essentially optimal. Moreover, the runtime\nof the RBP algorithm is bounded by $O(nr^2\\log n+n^2r)$, which compares very\nfavorably with the $\\Omega(n^4r^2\\log^{12}n)$ runtime of the SDP-based\nalgorithm. Perhaps more importantly, our algorithm will provide an exact\nreconstruction of the input matrix in polynomial time. By contrast, the\nSDP-based algorithm can only provide an approximate one in polynomial time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 May 2009 06:13:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 May 2009 03:38:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-15"}

The\ninvestigated geometry variations concern, in particular, the aspect ratio of\nheight to radius of the cylinder, and the thickness of the annular space to\nwhich the columnar flow is restricted.

In the vertically homogeneous stratification, it\nincreases with increasing wave energy and can even exceed 1. In the\nheterogeneous stratification, when IGW propagate towards stronger\nstratification, the maximal flux Richardson number decreases with increasing\nwave energy, reaches zero and then becomes negative.

In this paper,\nwe analyze the problem of temporal multi-mode effects by considering the pulse\nshape of the average output field obtained from a coherent input pulse. It is\nshown that a significant part of the two photon state transformation can be\nderived from this semi-classical description of the optical non-linearity. The\neffect of a non-linear system on a two photon state can then be determined from\nthe density matrix dynamics of the coherently driven system using input-output\ntheory.

This is a very\nconvenient approach, since only very few realisations have to be computed, in\ncontrast to Markov-Chain Monte Carlo methods. Finally, the proposed basis\nsystem can be applied to reconstruct the Hubble expansion rate from supernova\nluminosity distance data with the advantage of being sensitive to possible\nunexpected features in the data set. We test the method both on mock catalogues\nand on the SuperNova Legacy Survey data set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 May 2009 12:00:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Dec 2010 16:27:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-21"}

We present the results obtained from a long-term spectroscopic campaign\ndevoted to the multiplicity of O-type stars in the young open cluster NGC2244\nand in the Mon OB2 association. Methods. Our spectroscopic monitoring was\nperformed over several years, allowing us to probe different time-scales. For\neach star, several spectral diagnostic tools are applied, in order to search\nfor line shifts and profile variations. We also measure the projected\nrotational velocity and revisit the spectral classification. Results. In our\nsample, several stars were previously considered as spectroscopic binaries,\nthough only a few scattered observations were available. Our results now reveal\na more complex situation. Our study identifies two new spectroscopic binaries\n(HD46149 in NGC2244 and HD46573 in MonOB2). The first object is a long-period\ndouble-lined spectroscopic binary, though the exact value of its period remains\nuncertain and the second object is classified as an SB1 system with a period of\nabout 10.67 days but the time series of our observations do not enable us to\nderive a unique orbital solution for this system. We also classify another star\nas variable in radial velocity (HD46150) and we detect line profile variations\nin two rapid rotators (HD46056 and HD46485). Conclusions. This spectroscopic\ninvestigation places a firm lower limit (17%) on the binary fraction of O-stars\nin NGC2244 and reveals the lack of short-period O+OB systems in this cluster.\nIn addition, a comparison of these new results with two other well-studied\nclusters (NGC6231 and IC1805) puts forward possible hints of a relation between\nstellar density and binarity, which could provide constraints on the theories\nabout the formation and early evolution of hot stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 May 2009 10:16:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-09"}

We compare NEATM to radar\ndiameters and find that NEATM overestimates the diameter when the beaming\nparameter is fitted to multi-wavelength observations and underestimates the\ndiameter when the default beaming parameter is used.

Starting from 1999, the Whole\nEarth Blazar Telescope (WEBT) consortium has organized various multifrequency\ncampaigns on this blazar, collecting tens of thousands of data points. One of\nthe main issues in the study of this huge dataset has been the search for\ncorrelations between the optical and radio flux variations, and for possible\nperiodicities in the light curves. The analysis of the data assembled during\nthe first four campaigns (comprising also archival data to cover the period\n1968-2003) revealed a fair optical-radio correlation in 1994-2003, with a delay\nof the hard radio events of ~100 days. Moreover, various statistical methods\nsuggested the existence of a radio periodicity of ~8 years. In 2004 the WEBT\nstarted a new campaign to extend the dataset to the most recent observing\nseasons, in order to possibly confirm and better understand the previous\nresults. In this campaign we have collected and assembled about 11000 new\noptical observations from twenty telescopes, plus near-IR and radio data at\nvarious frequencies.

In general, we confirm the ~100-day delay of the\nhard radio events with respect to the optical ones, even if longer (~200-300\ndays) time lags are also found in particular periods.

Only coherent scattering probes can elucidate\ncollective molecular motions. While phonons in crystals were studied for half a\ncentury now, the study of collective molecular motions in soft-matter and\nbiology is a rather new but upcoming field. Collective dynamics often determine\nmaterial properties and interactions, and are crucial to establish\ndynamics-function relations. We review properties of neutrons and x-rays and\nderive the origin of coherent and incoherent scattering. Taking molecular\nmotions in membranes and proteins as example, the difference between coherent\nand incoherent dynamics is discussed, and how local and collective motions can\nbe accessed in x-ray and neutron scattering experiments. Matching of coherent\nproperties of the scattering probe may become important in soft-matter and\nbiology because of (1) the missing long ranged order and (2) the large length\nscales involved. It is likely to be important in systems, where fluctuating\nnanoscale domains strongly determine material properties. Inelastic scattering\ncan provide very local structural information in disordered systems. Inelastic\nneutron scattering experiments point to a coexistence of short-lived nanoscale\ngel and fluid domains in phospholipid bilayers in the range of the gel-fluid\nphase transition, which may be responsible for critical behavior and determine\nelastic properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 May 2009 15:25:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Dec 2009 03:18:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}
