Light axion-like states, with masses in the 1 MeV - 10 GeV range,\nare also generic, and can decay via Higgs couplings to light standard model\nparticles. Such a scenario is well motivated in the context of very low energy\nsupersymmetry breaking, where ubiquitous cosmological problems associated with\nthe gravitino are avoided. We investigate the astrophysical and collider\nsignatures of this scenario, assuming that dark matter decays into the\naxion-like states via dimension six operators, and we present an illustrative\nmodel exhibiting these features.

Investigating the intermediate or mesoscopic level of organization in\nthe nervous system is a vital step towards understanding how the integration of\nmicro-level dynamics results in macro-level functioning. In this paper, we have\nconsidered the somatic nervous system of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans,\nfor which the entire neuronal connectivity diagram is known. We focus on the\norganization of the system into modules, i.e., neuronal groups having\nrelatively higher connection density compared to that of the overall network.\nWe show that this mesoscopic feature cannot be explained exclusively in terms\nof considerations, such as optimizing for resource constraints (viz., total\nwiring cost) and communication efficiency (i.e., network path length).\nComparison with other complex networks designed for efficient transport (of\nsignals or resources) implies that neuronal networks form a distinct class.\nThis suggests that the principal function of the network, viz., processing of\nsensory information resulting in appropriate motor response, may be playing a\nvital role in determining the connection topology. Using modular spectral\nanalysis, we make explicit the intimate relation between function and structure\nin the nervous system. This is further brought out by identifying functionally\ncritical neurons purely on the basis of patterns of intra- and inter-modular\nconnections.

The argument is based on a proposal for the final theory that models\nnature at Planck scales as a collection of featureless strands that fluctuate\nin three dimensions. This approach models vacuum as untangled strands,\nparticles as tangles of strands, and Planck units as crossing switches.\n  Modelling vacuum as untangled strands implies the field equations of general\nrelativity, when applying an argument from 1995 to the thermodynamics of such\nstrands. Modelling fermions as tangles of two or more strands allows to define\nwave functions as time-averages of oriented strand crossing density. Using an\nargument from 1980, this allows to deduce the Dirac equation.\n  When fermions are modelled as tangled strands, gauge interactions appear\nnaturally as deformation of tangle cores. The three possible types of\nobservable core deformations are given by the three Reidemeister moves. They\nnaturally lead to a U(1), a broken and parity-violating SU(2), and a SU(3)\ngauge group. The corresponding Lagrangians also appear naturally.\n  The strand model is unique, is unmodifiable, is consistent with all known\ndata, and makes numerous testable predictions, including the absence of other\ninteractions, of grand unification, of supersymmetry and of higher dimensions.\nA method for calculating coupling constants seems to appear naturally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 May 2009 14:28:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 14 Nov 2009 18:27:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 20 Oct 2010 10:41:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-27"}
