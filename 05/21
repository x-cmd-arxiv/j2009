Of particular interest, the symmetry imposes that if an observer at\n\"r\" close to infinity sees a black hole of mass \"m\" an observer in the other\nasymptotic infinity beyond the horizon (at \"r\" close to \"0\") sees a dual mass\n\"mp/m\" (\"mp\" is the Planck mass). We then show that small LQBH are stable and\ncould be a component of dark matter. Ultra-light LQBHs created shortly after\nthe Big Bang would now have a mass of approximately \"10^(-5) mp\" and emit\nradiation with a typical energy of about 10^(13) - 10^(14) eV but they would\nalso emit cosmic rays of much higher energies, albeit few of them.

Instead of directly manipulating each qubit to perform universal\nquantum logic gates or measurements, ADQC uses a fixed two-qubit interaction to\ncouple the memory register of a quantum computer to an ancilla qubit. By\nmeasuring the ancilla, the measurement-induced back-action on the system\nperforms the desired logical operations.\n  By demanding that the ancilla-system qubit interaction should lead to unitary\nand stepwise deterministic evolution, and that it should be possible to\nstandardise the computation, that is, applying all global operations at the\nbeginning, we are able to place conditions on the interactions that can be used\nfor ADQC.

Frame dragging is shown herein to\nbe a universal causal agent for producing multi-messenger emissions. We discuss\nhigh energy emissions produced by gravitational spin-orbit coupling along the\naxis of rotation and low energy emissions from surrounding matter via a torus\nmagnetosphere. Model results point to ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs)\nfrom supermassive black holes at about the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) energy\nthreshold from low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN), and to high-energy\nphoton emissions from stellar mass black holes in ultra-relativistic capillary\njets. The former compares favorably with recent results by the Pierre Auger\nObservatory (PAO). The latter compares favorably with gamma-ray burst data from\nthe High Energy Transient Exporer (HETE) II, {\\em Swift} and the Burst and\nTransient Source Experiment (BATSE), wherein a finite lifetime of black hole\nspin is found to improve the correlation between peak energies and true\nenergies in gamma-rays. Matched filtering applied to 600 light curves of long\nGRBs identifies a process of viscous spin down against matter at the inner most\nstable circular orbit. We conclude that long GRBs are spin powered, not\naccretion powered, from core-collapse supernovae and merger events such as\nGRB060614. Contemporaneous low energy emissions are expected from surrounding\nmatter in gravitational waves by a pressure driven Papaloizou-Pringle\ninstability, and more so than in accompanying MeV-neutrinos and magnetic winds.\nThe latter powers aspherical radio-loud supernovae in collapsars and long\nduration extragalactic radio bursts from GRB060614 type events. This outlook is\nof interest to emerging multi-messenger surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 May 2009 17:59:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2010 15:38:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-04"}

In photometric conditions, the sky background is ~0.1\nmag/arcsec^2 higher than the median when observing toward Tucson and Phoenix\nbut it may be up to ~0.5 mag/arcsec^2 higher in non-photometric conditions. The\nsky at Mt.Graham is ~0.32 mag/arcsec^2 brighter at airmass ~1.4 than at zenith\nbut no significant trend was found with the time of the night.

Therefore, such a transition\ncan be interpreted as the operation of \"flipping a qubit\", and the number of\northogonal states visited by the system per unit time can be viewed as the\nmaximum rate of operation.\n  A lower bound on the orthogonalization time, based on the energy spread\nDeltaE, was found by Mandelstam and Tamm.

The two\npopulations of planets to be detected through this channel are wide-separation\nplanets and free-floating planets. Although they appear as similar short\ntime-scale events, the two populations of planets are widely different in\nnature and thus distinguishing them is important. In this paper, we investigate\nthe lensing properties of events produced by planets with moderately wide\nseparations from host stars. We find that the lensing behavior of these events\nis well described by the Chang-Refsdal lensing and the shear caused by the\nprimary not only produces a caustic but also makes the magnification contour\nelongated along the primary-planet axis. The elongated magnification contour\nimplies that the light curves of these planetary events are generally\nasymmetric and thus the asymmetry can be used to distinguish the events from\nthose produced by free-floating planets. The asymmetry can be noticed from the\noverall shape of the light curve and thus can hardly be missed unlike the very\nshort-duration central perturbation caused by the caustic. In addition, the\nasymmetry occurs regardless of the event magnification and thus the bound\nnature of the planet can be identified for majority of these events. The close\napproximation of the lensing light curve to that of the Chang-Refsdal lensing\nimplies that the analysis of the light curve yields only the information about\nthe projected separation between the host star and the planet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 May 2009 02:50:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-22"}

We consider two\nmodels of unknown supply: the adversarial supply model, in which the mechanism\nmust produce a welfare guarantee for any arbitrary supply, and the stochastic\nsupply model, in which supply is drawn from a distribution known to the\nmechanism, and the mechanism need only provide a welfare guarantee in\nexpectation.\n  Our main result is a separation between these two models.

This suppression is\nconsidered to be due to the energy lost by hard scattered partons in the medium\n(jet quenching), which results in a decrease of the yield at a given pT.\n  The magnitude of the suppression depends on the path length of scattered\npartons in the medium.

Assuming that\nthe PR link adapts its transmit power and/or rate upon receiving an\ninterference signal from the CR and such transmit adaptations are observable by\nthe CR, this results in a new form of feedback from the PR to CR, refereed to\nas hidden PR feedback, whereby the CR learns the PR's strategy for transmit\nadaptations without the need of a dedicated feedback channel from the PR. In\nthis paper, we exploit the hidden PR feedback to design new learning and\ntransmission schemes for spectrum sharing based CRs, namely active learning and\nsupervised transmission. For active learning, the CR initiatively sends a\nprobing signal to interfere with the PR, and from the observed PR transmit\nadaptations the CR estimates the channel gain from its transmitter to the PR\nreceiver, which is essential for the CR to control its interference to the PR\nduring the subsequent data transmission. This paper proposes a new transmission\nprotocol for the CR to implement the active learning and the solutions to deal\nwith various practical issues for implementation, such as time synchronization,\nrate estimation granularity, power measurement noise, and channel variation.\nFurthermore, with the acquired knowledge from active learning, the CR designs a\nsupervised data transmission by effectively controlling the interference powers\nboth to and from the PR, so as to achieve the optimum performance tradeoffs for\nthe PR and CR links.

The period distribution of the SDSS CVs differs\ndramatically from that of all the previously known CVs, in particular it\ncontains a significant accumulation of systems in the orbital period range\n80--86 min. We identify this feature as the elusive \"period minimum spike\"\npredicted by CV population models, which resolves a long-standing discrepancy\nbetween compact binary evolution theory and observations. We show that this\nspike is almost entirely due to the large number of CVs with very low accretion\nactivity identified by SDSS. The optical spectra of these systems are dominated\nby emission from the white dwarf photosphere, and display little or no\nspectroscopic signature from the donor stars, suggesting very low-mass\ncompanion stars.

With these operations $\\BZ\\mathbf D$ is a Hopf algebra,\nself-dual with respect to a scalar product which counts the number of pictures\n(in the sense of Zelevinsky) between two double posets. The product and\ncoproduct correspond respectively to disjoint union of posets and to a natural\ndecomposition of a poset into order ideals. Restricting to special double\nposets (meaning that the second order is total), we obtain a notion equivalent\nto Stanley's labelled posets, and obtain a sub-Hopf-algebra already considered\nby Blessenohl and Schocker. The mapping which maps each double poset onto the\nsum of the linear extensions of its first order, identified via its second\n(total) order with permutations, is a Hopf algebra homomorphism, which is\nisometric and preserves the internal product, onto the Hopf algebra of\npermutations, previously considered by the two authors.
