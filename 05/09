It is then shown that the gluino\nNLSP (GNLSP) models lead to a compressed sfermion spectrum with the sleptons\noften heavier than the squarks at least for the first two generations. The\nrelic density here is governed by gluino coannihilation which is responsible\nfor a relatively small mass splitting between the gluino and the neutralino\nmasses. Thus the GNLSP class of models is very predictive first because the\nSUSY production cross sections at the LHC are dominated by gluino production\nand second because the gluino production itself proceeds dominantly through a\nsingle channel which allows for a direct determination of the gluino mass and\nan indirect determination of the neutralino mass due to a linear relation\nbetween these two masses which is highly constrained by coannihilation. A\ndetailed analysis of these models shows that the jet production and tagged\nb-jets from the gluino production can be discriminated from the standard model\nbackground with appropriate cuts. It is found that the GNLSP models can be\ntested with just 10 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity and may therefore be\nchecked with low luminosity runs in the first data at the LHC. Thus if a GNLSP\nmodel is realized, the LHC will turn into a gluino factory through a profuse\nproduction of gluinos with typically only a small fraction $\\lesssim 5%$ of\ntotal SUSY events arising from other production modes over the allowed GNLSP\nmodel parameter space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 May 2009 16:47:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2009 18:19:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

By adjusting the common\nfrequency of the sender and the receiver oscillators to be out of resonance\nwith that of the transmitters, we demonstrate that the sender's state tunnels\nto the receiver oscillator by virtually exciting the nonideal transmitter\nchain.

Although GG channel model offers analytical\ntractability in the analysis of single input single output (SISO) wireless\nsystems, difficulties arise when studying multiple input multiple output (MIMO)\nsystems, where the distribution of the sum of independent GG variates is\nrequired. In this paper, we present a novel simple closed-form approximation\nfor the distribution of the sum of independent, but not necessarily identically\ndistributed GG variates.

Different degrees of granularity is achieved by using the\ndeposition temperature (T$_{D}$) of 700 and 800 $^{0}$C. Although no\nsignificant change in magnetic order temperature (T$_C$) and saturation\nmagnetization is seen for these two types of films, the temperature and\nmagnetic field dependence of their resistivity ($\\rho$(T, H)) is strikingly\ndissimilar. While the $\\rho$(T,H) of the 800 $^{0}$C film is comparable to that\nof epitaxial samples, the lower growth temperature leads to a material which\nundergoes insulator-to-metal transition at a temperature (T$_{P}$ $\\approx$ 170\nK) much lower than T$_C$.

Two versions of the\nmodel are studied, one with non-thermal DM as the origin of the boost factor\nand one with Sommerfeld enhancement. In the case of non-thermal DM, four hidden\nsector scalars which transform under a U(1)_{X} symmetry are added. The\nheaviest scalars decouple and later decay to DM scalars, so providing the boost\nfactor necessary to explain the present DM annihilation rate. The mass of the\nannihilating scalars is limited to < 600 GeV for the model to remain\nperturbative. U(1)_{X} breaking to Z_2 at the electroweak transition mixes\nlight O(100) MeV hidden sector scalars with the Higgs. The DM scalars\nannihilate to these light scalars, which subsequently decay to two mu^{+}\nmu^{-} pairs via Higgs mixing, so generating a positron excess without\nantiprotons. Decay to \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-} rather than e^{+}e^{-} is necessary to\nensure a fast enough light scalar decay rate to evade light scalar domination\nat nucleosynthesis. In the version with Sommerfeld enhancement only three new\nscalars are necessary.

Observations of nearby star forming galaxies bring their\nbatch of apparent contradictions between Lya emission and their physical\nparameters, and call for a detailed understanding of the physical processes at\nwork. IZw 18, one of the most metal-poor galaxies known is of particular\ninterest in this context.\n  We use a 3D Lya radiation transfer code to model Hubble Space Telescope (HST)\nobservations of IZw 18 and to fit its Lya spectrum. Different geometrical\nconfigurations of the source and the neutral gas are explored.\n  The integrated Lya profile of NW region of IZw 18 is reproduced using the\nobserved small amount of dust (E(B-V) ~ 0.05) and a spherical HI shell with\nN(HI) = 6.5 x 10^(21) cm^(-2). Such a high column density makes it possible to\ntransform a strong Lya emission (EW(Lya) = 60 A) into a damped absorption even\nwith a small extinction. When a slab geometry is applied and a given line of\nsight is chosen, the Lya profile can be successfully reproduced with no dust at\nall and N(HI) = 3 x 10^(21) cm^(-2). The spatial variations of the profile\nshape are naturally explained by radiation transfer effects. In the case of\noutflowing Inter Stellar Medium (ISM), as commonly observed in Lyman Break\nGalaxies (LBGs), a high N(H) and dust content are required to observe Lya in\nabsorption. For nearly static neutral gas as observed in IZw 18 and other low\nluminosity galaxies only a small amount of dust is required provided a\nsufficiently high N(H) covers the galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 May 2009 20:02:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Observationally distinguishing between astrophysical\nblack holes and gravastars is a major challenge for this latter theoretical\nmodel. In the context of stationary and axially symmetrical geometries, a\npossibility of distinguishing gravastars from black holes is through the\ncomparative study of thin accretion disks around rotating gravastars and\nKerr-type black holes, respectively. In the present paper, we consider\naccretion disks around slowly rotating gravastars, with all the metric tensor\ncomponents estimated up to the second order in the angular velocity. Due to the\ndifferences in the exterior geometry, the thermodynamic and electromagnetic\nproperties of the disks (energy flux, temperature distribution and equilibrium\nradiation spectrum) are different for these two classes of compact objects,\nconsequently giving clear observational signatures. In addition to this, it is\nalso shown that the conversion efficiency of the accreting mass into radiation\nis always smaller than the conversion efficiency for black holes, i.e.,\ngravastars provide a less efficient mechanism for converting mass to radiation\nthan black holes. Thus, these observational signatures provide the possibility\nof clearly distinguishing rotating gravastars from Kerr-type black holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 May 2009 22:16:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Sep 2009 20:52:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-06"}

Further, lipid composition and morphology can play a key\nrole in regulating a variety of biological processes. For example, viral\nuptake, plasma membrane tension regulation, and the formation of caveolae all\nrequire the creation and control of groups of lipids that adopt specific\nmorphologies. In this paper, we use a simplified model mixture of lipids and\ncholesterol to examine the interplay between lipid phase-separation and bilayer\nmorphology. We observe and theoretically analyze three main features of\nphase-separated giant unilamellar vesicles. First, by tracking the motion of\n`dimpled' domains, we measure repulsive, elastic interactions that create\nshort--range translational and orientational order, leading to a stable\ndistribution of domain sizes, and hence maintaining lateral heterogeneity on\nrelatively short length scales and long time scales. Second, we examine the\ntransition to `budded' domain morphologies, showing that the transition is\nsize-selective, and has two kinetic regimes, as revealed by a calculated phase\ndiagram. Finally, using observations of the interactions between dimpled and\nbudded domains, we build a theoretical framework with an elastic model that\nmaps the free energies and allowed transitions in domain morphology upon\ncoalescence, to serve as an interpretive tool for understanding the algebra of\ndomain morphology. In all three cases, the two major factors that regulate\ndomain morphology and morphological transitions are the domain size and\nmembrane tension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 May 2009 13:22:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-12"}

By choosing the light-front gauge and adopting a basis\nfunction representation, we obtain a large, sparse, Hamiltonian matrix for mass\neigenstates of gauge theories that is solvable by adapting the ab initio\nno-core methods of nuclear many-body theory. Full covariance is recovered in\nthe continuum limit, the infinite matrix limit. There is considerable freedom\nin the choice of the orthonormal and complete set of basis functions with\nconvenience and convergence rates providing key considerations. Here, we use a\ntwo-dimensional harmonic oscillator basis for transverse modes that corresponds\nwith eigensolutions of the soft-wall AdS/QCD model obtained from light-front\nholography. We outline our approach and present illustrative features of some\nnon-interacting systems in a cavity. We illustrate the first steps towards\nsolving QED by obtaining the mass eigenstates of an electron in a cavity in\nsmall basis spaces and discuss the computational challenges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 May 2009 15:35:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2009 21:30:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}
