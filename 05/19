The theory assumes local SDW order, and associated electron and\nhole pocket Fermi surfaces of charge carriers in the normal state. We describe\nquantum and thermal fluctuations in the orientation of the local SDW order,\nwhich lead to d-wave superconductivity: we compute the superconducting critical\ntemperature and magnetic field in a `minimal' universal theory. We also\ndescribe the back-action of the superconductivity on the SDW order, showing\nthat SDW order is more stable in the metal. Our results capture key aspects of\nthe phase diagram of Demler et al. (cond-mat/0103192) obtained in a\nphenomenological quantum theory of competing orders. Finally, we propose a\nfinite temperature crossover phase diagram for the cuprates. In the metallic\nstate, these are controlled by a `hidden' quantum critical point near optimal\ndoping involving the onset of SDW order in a metal. However, the onset of\nsuperconductivity results in a decrease in stability of the SDW order, and\nconsequently the actual SDW quantum critical point appears at a significantly\nlower doping.\n  All our analysis is placed in the context of recent experimental results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2009 19:54:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2009 20:30:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2009 15:29:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-16"}

This is because we possess the so-called\nassociative memory, that is the ability to correlate different memories to the\nsame fact or event. Associative memory is such a fundamental and encompassing\nhuman ability (and not just human) that the network of neurons in our brain\nmust perform it quite easily. The question is then whether electronic neural\nnetworks (electronic schemes that act somewhat similarly to human brains) can\nbe built to perform this type of function. Although the field of neural\nnetworks has developed for many years, a key element, namely the synapses\nbetween adjacent neurons, has been lacking a satisfactory electronic\nrepresentation. The reason for this is that a passive circuit element able to\nreproduce the synapse behaviour needs to remember its past dynamical history,\nstore a continuous set of states, and be \"plastic\" according to the\npre-synaptic and post-synaptic neuronal activity. Here we show that all this\ncan be accomplished by a memory-resistor (memristor for short). In particular,\nby using simple and inexpensive off-the-shelf components we have built a\nmemristor emulator which realizes all required synaptic properties. Most\nimportantly, we have demonstrated experimentally the formation of associative\nmemory in a simple neural network consisting of three electronic neurons\nconnected by two memristor-emulator synapses. This experimental demonstration\nopens up new possibilities in the understanding of neural processes using\nmemory devices, an important step forward to reproduce complex learning,\nadaptive and spontaneous behaviour with electronic neural networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2009 17:16:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2009 16:00:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2010 02:39:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-26"}

This leads to\norder one fluctuations in the inertial to gravitational mass ratio. In Jordan\nframe, it is no longer true that all objects move on geodesics. In contrast, if\nthe scalar screening occurrs via strong coupling, such as in the DGP braneworld\nmodel, equivalence principle violation occurrs at a much reduced level. We\npropose several observational tests of the chameleon mechanism: 1. small\ngalaxies should fall faster than large galaxies, even when dynamical friction\nis negligible; 2. voids defined by small galaxies would be larger compared to\nstandard expectations; 3. stars and diffuse gas in small galaxies should have\ndifferent velocities, even on the same orbits; 4. lensing and dynamical mass\nestimates should agree for large galaxies but disagree for small ones. We\ndiscuss possible pitfalls in some of these tests. The cleanest is the third one\nwhere mass estimate from HI rotational velocity could exceed that from stars by\n30 % or more. To avoid blanket screening of all objects, the most promising\nplace to look is in voids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2009 20:17:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2009 04:01:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The eccentricity of HD191760b is found to be\n0.63+/-0.01, meaning it reaches as close as 0.5 AU from the host star.\nDynamical simulations indicate that no inner planets could reside at\nseparations beyond ~0.17 AU due to the disastrous gravity imposed by HD191760b.\nIn addition to these first results we also refine the orbits found for the\nexoplanets around the stars HD48265, HD143361 and HD154672. All 1-planet\nsolutions are in agreement with those previously published by the Magellan\nPlanet Search.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 May 2009 00:47:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

To test this, here we make use of a local (0.04<z<0.1)\nsample of ~500 radio AGN with available optical spectroscopy, drawn from the\nFIRST, NVSS, SDSS, and 3CRR surveys. A clear dichotomy is found between the\nproperties of low-excitation (absorption line AGN, and LINERs) and\nhigh-excitation (Seyferts) radio AGN. The hosts of the first have the highest\nstellar masses, reddest optical colors, and highest mass black holes but\naccrete inefficiently (at low rates). On the other hand, the high-excitation\nradio AGN have lower stellar masses, bluer optical colors (consistent with the\n`green valley'), and lower mass black holes that accrete efficiently (at high\nrates). Such properties can be explained if these two radio AGN populations\nrepresent different stages in the formation of massive galaxies, and thus are\nalso linked to different phases of the `AGN feedback'.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2009 21:23:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 May 2009 00:53:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

Due to their potential to solve sparse linear systems with an effort\nthat is linear in the number of unknowns, algebraic multigrid (AMG) methods are\nof fundamental interest for such systems. For symmetric positive definite\nmatrices, fundamental theoretical convergence results are established, and\nefficient AMG solvers have been developed. In contrast, for non-symmetric\nmatrices, theoretical convergence results have been provided only recently. A\nproperty that is sufficient for convergence is that the matrix be an M-matrix.\nIn this paper, we present how the simulation of incompressible fluid flows with\nparticle methods leads to large linear systems with sparse, non-symmetric\nmatrices. In each time step, the Poisson equation is approximated by meshfree\nfinite differences. While traditional least squares approaches do not guarantee\nan M-matrix structure, an approach based on linear optimization yields\noptimally sparse M-matrices. For both types of discretization approaches, we\ninvestigate the performance of a classical AMG method, as well as an AMLI type\nmethod. While in the considered test problems, the M-matrix structure turns out\nnot to be necessary for the convergence of AMG, problems can occur when it is\nviolated. In addition, the matrices obtained by the linear optimization\napproach result in fast solution times due to their optimal sparsity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2009 23:13:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2009 05:42:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-04"}

Simultaneously, the interest\nin narrative vehicles increases while certain occupations, seeing the narrative\nas a structure, obscure the examination of the process of selecting, arranging\nand rendering story material. To correct this deficiency, a method for a\nnarrative bridging that encourages research and design while exploring\nnarration as a process, is proposed with the aim to not diminish the properties\nof the interactive media. This method focuses on the initial phase where\nestablishing and handling the information takes place and creates a foundation\nthat precedes its systematization and computation. The aim is to give designers\na comfortable design tool that firmly aids the design without interfering with\ncreativity, and at the same time aids the construction of interplay between\nnarration, spatiality and interactivity. The method aided the practise of a\ndiscipline that was established through a qualitative study conducted as part\nof a university course in rapid prototyping. The results demonstrated that the\nmethod aided time-constrained design processes, simultaneously detecting\ninconsistencies that would prevent the team from making improvements.

It is shown that the\ndevelopment of the theory of cosmic ray origin leads inevitably to the\nconclusion that cosmic ray propagation in the Galaxy is determined by effective\nparticle scattering, which is described by spatial diffusion. The Galactic Disk\nis surrounded by an extended halo, in which cosmic rays are confined before\nescaping into intergalactic space. For a long time cosmic ray convective\noutflow from the Galaxy (galactic wind) was believed to be insignificant.\nHowever, investigations of hydrodynamic stability and an analysis of ISM\ndynamics (including cosmic rays) showed that a galactic wind was emanating near\nthe disk, and accelerating towards the halo, reaching its maximum velocity far\naway from the disk. Therefore convective cosmic ray transport should be\nimportant in galactic halos. Recent analysis of the gamma-ray emissivity in the\nGalactic disk of EGRET data, which showed that cosmic rays are more or less\nuniformly distributed in the radial direction of the disk, as well as the\ninterpretation of soft X-ray emission in galactic halos, give convincing\nevidence of the existence of a galactic wind in star forming galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 May 2009 11:47:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-20"}

Initiation of the\ndetonation occurs spontaneously in a region where the length scale of the\ntemperature gradient extending from a flow (in which carbon burning is already\noccurring) into unburned fuel is commensurate to the range of critical length\nscales which have been derived from 1D simulations that resolve the initiation\nof a detonation. By increasing the maximum resolution in a truncated cone that\nencompasses this region, beginning somewhat before initiation of the detonation\noccurs, we successfully simulate in situ the first gradient-initiated\ndetonation in a whole-star simulation. The detonation emerges when a\ncompression wave overruns a pocket of fuel situated in a Kelvin-Helmholtz cusp\nat the leading edge of the inwardly directed jet of burning carbon. The\ncompression wave pre-conditions the temperature in the fuel in such a way that\nthe Zel'dovich gradient mechanism can operate and a detonation ensues. We\nexplore the dependence of the length scale of the temperature gradient on\nspatial resolution and discuss the implications for the robustness of this\ndetonation mechanism. We find that the time and the location at which\ninitiation of the detonation occurs varies with resolution. In particular,\ninitiation of a detonation had not yet occurred in our highest resolution\nsimulation by the time we ended the simulation because of the computational\ndemand it required. We suggest that the turbulent shear layer surrounding the\ninwardly directed jet provides the most favorable physical conditions, and\ntherefore the most likely location, for initiation of a detonation in the GCD\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 May 2009 13:32:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-22"}

To answer the first question we develop an (in principle,\nexact) path-integral approach in phase-space based on the symmetric (Weyl)\nordering of creation and annihilation operators.
