What\nwould that imply? An intriguing possibility is that the new fermions needed to\ncompensate for the new leptons gauge anomalies simultaneously address the big\nhierarchy problem of the Standard Model. A natural way to accomplish such a\nscenario is to have the Higgs itself be composite of these new fermions. This\nis the setup we are going to investigate in this paper using as a template\nMinimal Walking Technicolor. We analyze a general heavy neutrino mass structure\nwith and without mixing with the Standard Model families. We also analyze the\nLHC potential to observe the fourth lepton family in tandem with the new\ncomposite Higgs dynamics.

The survey, which covers 15,000 square\ndegrees multiple times over 3.5 years, allows for the first ensemble blazar\nstudy of this scale. Variability amplitude distributions are shown for the FSRQ\nand BL Lac samples for numerous time lags, and also studied through structure\nfunction analyses. Individual blazars show a wide range of variability\namplitudes, timescales, and duty cycles.

Assuming supersymmetry, we update the quark and lepton mass\nmatrices at the grand unification scale accounting for threshold corrections\nenhanced by large tan beta. From the hypothesis that quark and lepton masses\nsatisfy a classic set of relationships suggested in some Grand Unified Theories\n(GUTs), we predict tan beta needs to be large, and the gluino's soft mass needs\nto have the opposite sign to the wino's soft mass. Existing tools to measure\nthe phase of the gluino's mass at upcoming hadron colliders require\nmodel-independent, kinematic techniques to determine the masses of the new\nsupersymmetric particle states. We discuss the current techniques to determine\nthe mass of invisible particles. We review the transverse mass kinematic\nvariable M_{T2} and the use of invariant-mass edges to find relationships\nbetween masses. Next, we introduce a new technique to add additional\nconstraints between the masses of new particle states using M_{T2} at different\nstages in a symmetric decay chain. These new relationships further constrain\nthe mass differences between new particle states, but still leave the absolute\nmass weakly determined.

The distortion of signal\ncorrelations as they are transformed through particular LNP models is\npredictable and in some cases analytically tractable and invertible.

Although in principle filter kernels are\nnot necessarily minimum-phase, and only their spectral amplitude can be\nuniquely determined from output correlations, we show that in practice this\nmethod provides excellent estimates of kernels from a range of parametric\nmodels of neural systems.

We propose a practical CR transmission strategy\nconsisting of three major stages: environment learning, channel training, and\ndata transmission. In the environment learning stage, the CR transceivers both\nlisten to the PR transmission and apply blind algorithms to estimate the spaces\nthat are orthogonal to the channels from the PR. Assuming time-division duplex\n(TDD) based transmission for the PR, cognitive beamforming is then designed and\napplied at CR transceivers to restrict the interference to/from the PR during\nthe subsequent channel training and data transmission stages. In the channel\ntraining stage, the CR transmitter sends training signals to the CR receiver,\nwhich applies the linear-minimum-mean-square-error (LMMSE) based estimator to\nestimate the effective channel. Considering imperfect estimations in both\nlearning and training stages, we derive a lower bound on the ergodic capacity\nachievable for the CR in the data transmission stage. From this capacity lower\nbound, we observe a general learning/training/throughput tradeoff associated\nwith the proposed scheme, pertinent to transmit power allocation between\ntraining and transmission stages, as well as time allocation among learning,\ntraining, and transmission stages. We characterize the aforementioned tradeoff\nby optimizing the associated power and time allocation to maximize the CR\nergodic capacity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 May 2009 09:17:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-12"}

This theorem improves upon both a 2000 result of Andersson\nand Carlsson and the classical 1977 result of Varopoulos. The former result\nobtains solutions for strictly pseudoconvex domains in the larger space\n$H^{\\infty}\\cdot BMOA$ with $N=\\infty $, while the latter result obtains\n$BMOA(\\mathbb{B}_{n})$ solutions for just N=2 generators with $h=1$. Our method\nof proof is to solve $\\overline{\\partial}$-problems and to exploit the\nconnection between $BMO$ functions and Carleson measures for\n$H^{2}(\\mathbb{B}_{n})$. Key to this is the exact structure of the kernels that\nsolve the $\\overline{\\partial}$ equation for $(0,q)$ forms, as well as new\nestimates for iterates of these operators. A generalization to multiplier\nalgebras of Besov-Sobolev spaces is also given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 May 2009 13:35:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-19"}

All Feynman amplitudes corresponding to diagrams with no\nfermion loops regulated in this manner automatically satisfy the Ward-Takahashi\nidentities. This is in contrast to the scheme of Breitenlohner and Maison, in\nwhich finite counter-terms are needed to restore gauge invariance. This\nrightmost gamma5 scheme also has an advantage over the naive dimensional\nregularization scheme which does not have a definitive prescription consistent\nwith gauge symmetry. Diagrams with fermion loops can be handled by selecting a\nproper cut point on each fermion loop to play the role of the point of the\nrightmost position.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 May 2009 14:49:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-12"}
