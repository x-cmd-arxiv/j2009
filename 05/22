We compare the results\nfrom two large-scale hydrodynamical simulations of star cluster formation that\nresolve the fragmentation process down to the opacity limit, the first of which\nwas reported by Bate, Bonnell and Bromm. The initial conditions of the two\ncalculations are identical, but in the new simulation the power spectrum of the\nvelocity field imposed on the cloud initially and allowed to decay is biased in\nfavour of large-scale motions. Whereas the calculation of Bate et al. began\nwith a power spectrum P(k) ~ k^{-4} to match the Larson scaling relations for\nthe turbulent motions observed in molecular clouds, the new calculation begins\nwith a power spectrum P(k) ~ k^{-6}. Despite this change to the initial motions\nin the cloud and the resulting density structure of the molecular cloud, the\nresulting stellar properties resulting from the two calculations are\nindistinguishable. This demonstrates that the results of such hydrodynamical\ncalculations of star cluster formation are relatively insensitive to the\ninitial conditions.

Instead of\nrelying on the general notions of real numbers, limits and continuity, we treat\nfunctions as the primary objects of our theory, and view differentiation as\ndivision of f(x)-f(a) by x-a in a certain class of functions. When f is a\npolynomial the division can be carried out explicitly. To see why a polynomial\nwith a positive derivative is increasing (the monotonicity theorem), we use the\nestimate |f(x)-f(a)-f'(a)(x-a)|<=K(x-a)^2. By making it into a definition we\narrive at the notion of uniform Lipschitz differentiability (ULD), and see that\nthe derivative of a ULD function is Lipschitz. Taking different moduli of\ncontinuity instead of |.|, we get different flavors of calculus, each rather\nelementary, but all together covering the total range of continuously\ndifferentiable functions. Using functions continuous at a, we recapture the\nclassical definition of differentiability at a point. We also see that ULD is\nequivalent to divisibility of f(x)-f(a) by x-a in the class of Lipschitz\nfunctions of two variables, x and a. The analogous fact is true for any\nsubadditive modulus of continuity.

MACS J0717.5+3745 is an X-ray luminous and complex\nmerging cluster, located at a redshift of 0.55. Here we present Giant Metrewave\nRadio Telescope (GMRT) radio observations at 610 MHz of this cluster. The main\naim of the observations is to search for diffuse radio emission within the\ngalaxy cluster MACS J0717.5+3745 related to the ongoing merger. These GMRT\nobservations are complemented by Very Large Array (VLA) archival observations\nat 1.4, 4.9 and 8.5 GHz. We have discovered a radio halo in the cluster MACS\nJ0717.5+3745 with a size of about 1.2 Mpc. The radio power P_1.4 GHz is 5 x\n10^25 W/Hz, which makes it the most powerful radio halo known till date. A 700\nkpc radio structure, which we classify as a radio relic, is located in between\nthe merging substructures of the system. The location of this relic roughly\ncoincides with regions of the intra-cluster medium (ICM) that have a\nsignificant enhancement in temperature as shown by Chandra. The major axis of\nthe relic is also roughly perpendicular to the merger axis. This shows that the\nrelic might be the result of a merger-related shock wave, where particles are\naccelerated via the diffuse shock acceleration (DSA) mechanism. Alternatively,\nthe relic might trace an accretion shock of a large-scale galaxy filament to\nthe south-west.

On the other hand, experimental evidences show\nthat there exists a non-zero cosmological constant, which implies in a deSitter\nspace-time, not compatible with the assumed Minkowski structure. Such\ninconsistency is shown to be a consequence of the lack of a application\nindependent curvature standard in Riemann's geometry, leading eventually to the\ncosmological constant problem in general relativity.\n  We show how the curvature standard in Riemann's geometry can be fixed by\nNash's theorem on locally embedded Riemannian geometries, which imply in the\nexistence of extra dimensions. The resulting gravitational theory is more\ngeneral than general relativity, similar to brane-world gravity, but where the\npropagation of the gravitational field along the extra dimensions is a\nmathematical necessity, rather than being a a postulate. After a brief\nintroduction to Nash's theorem, we show that the vacuum energy density must\nremain confined to four-dimensional space-times, but the cosmological constant\nresulting from the contracted Bianchi identity is a gravitational contribution\nwhich propagates in the extra dimensions.

The typical energies of these neutrinos are rather\nhigh, E ~ (100-200)MeV. Neutrino spin precession in the magnetic field either\ninside the collapsing star or in the interstellar space may lead to the\nbackward transition, nu_R->nu_L.

Using recent\nresults on the global climate thermodynamics, we show that that the two regimes\nfeature radically different properties. The efficiency of the climate machine\nincreases with decreasing solar constant in W climate conditions, whereas the\nopposite takes place in the SB regime. Instead, entropy production is\nincreasing with the solar constant in both branches of climate conditions, and\nits value is about 4 times as large in the W branch than in the corresponding C\nstate. Finally, the degree of irreversibility of the system is much higher in\nthe W conditions, with an explosive growth in the upper range of the considered\nvalues of solar constants. Whereas in the SB regime a dominating role is played\nby changes in the meridional albedo contrast, in the W climate regime changes\nin the intensity of latent heat fluxes are crucial for determining the observed\nproperties.

It is found that even moderate firing rates cause significant\nintracellular Na$^{+}$ build-up, and the ATP consumption rate associated with\npumping out these ions grows nonlinearly with frequency. Surprisingly, the\npower dissipated by the Na$^{+}$/K$^{+}$ pump depends biphasically on\nfrequency, which can lead to the biphasic dependence of brain temperature on\nfrequency as well.

The LMC is an ideal environment to study stellar MFs, because it\ncontains a large population of compact clusters at different evolutionary\nstages. We aim to obtain constraints on the initial MFs (IMFs) of our sample\nclusters on the basis of their present-day MFs, combined with our understanding\nof their dynamical and photometric evolution.\n  Methods.

Since the relaxation timescales of low-mass stars are very long,\ndynamical evolution will not have affected the MFs below 1.0 Msun\nsignificantly, so that - within the uncertainties - the derived MFs are\nconsistent with the solar-neighbourhood IMF, at least for the younger clusters.\n  Conclusions. The IMF in the low-density, low-metallicity environment of the\nLMC disk is not significantly different from that in the solar neighbourhood.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 May 2009 15:25:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}
