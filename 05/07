As a result of\nthis beaming factor, the true energy release from a GRB is usually several\norders of magnitude smaller than the observed isotropic value. Measuring this\nopening angle, typically inferred from an achromatic steepening in the\nafterglow light curve (a \"jet\" break), has proven exceedingly difficult in the\nSwift era. Here we undertake a study of five of the brightest (in terms of the\nisotropic prompt gamma-ray energy release, E(gamma, iso)) GRBs in the Swift era\nto search for jet breaks and hence constrain the collimation-corrected energy\nrelease. We present multi-wavelength (radio through X-ray) observations of GRBs\n050820A, 060418, and 080319B, and construct afterglow models to extract the\nopening angle and beaming-corrected energy release for all three events.\nTogether with results from previous analyses of GRBs 050904 and 070125, we find\nevidence for an achromatic jet break in all five events, strongly supporting\nthe canonical picture of GRBs as collimated explosions. The most natural\nexplanation for the lack of observed jet breaks from most Swift GRBs is\ntherefore selection effects. However, the opening angles for the events in our\nsample are larger than would be expected if all GRBs had a canonical energy\nrelease of ~ 10e51 erg. The total energy release we measure for those\n\"hyper-energetic\" (E(total) >~ 10e52 erg) events in our sample is large enough\nto start challenging models with a magnetar as the compact central remnant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 May 2009 17:35:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-12"}

The data show deviations\nfrom a simple power law model, but also a clear spectral variability. The\ntime-resolved spectra are fitted by a synchrotron model, where the observed\nspectrum is due to a exponentially cutoff power law distribution of electrons\nradiating in uniform magnetic field; this model is preferred over a broken\npower law. As another scenario, we separate the spectrum into \"steady\" and\n\"variable\" components by subtracting the spectrum in the lowest-flux period\nfrom those of other data segments. In this context, the difference (\"variable\")\nspectra are all well described by a broken power law model with photon index\nGamma ~ 1.6, breaking at energy epsilon_{brk} ~ 3 keV to another photon index\nGamma ~ 2.1 above the break energy, differing from each other only by\nnormalization, while the spectrum of the \"steady\" component is best described\nby the synchrotron model. We suggest the rapidly variable component is due to\nrelatively localized shock (Fermi I) acceleration, while the slowly variable\n(\"steady\") component is due to the superposition of shocks located at larger\ndistance along the jet, or due to other acceleration process, such as the\nstochastic acceleration on magnetic turbulence (Fermi II) in the more extended\nregion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 May 2009 16:24:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 May 2009 01:19:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-24"}

In such a\nsystem, the flux qubits only need to be read at the end of an adiabatic\nevolution when quantum mechanical tunneling has been suppressed, thus\nsimplifying many aspects of the readout process. The readout architecture for\nan $N$-qubit adiabatic quantum optimization system comprises $N$ hysteretic dc\nSQUIDs and $N$ rf SQUID latches controlled by $2\\sqrt{N} + 2$ bias lines. The\nlatching elements are coupled to the qubits and the dc SQUIDs are then coupled\nto the latching elements. This readout scheme provides two key advantages:\nFirst, the latching elements provide exceptional flux sensitivity that\nsignificantly exceeds what may be achieved by directly coupling the flux qubits\nto the dc SQUIDs using a practical mutual inductance. Second, the states of the\nlatching elements are robust against the influence of ac currents generated by\nthe switching of the hysteretic dc SQUIDs, thus allowing one to interrogate the\nlatching elements repeatedly so as to mitigate the effects of stochastic\nswitching of the dc SQUIDs. We demonstrate that it is possible to achieve\nsingle qubit read error rates of $<10^{-6}$ with this readout scheme.

In contrast, this ratio should decrease according to the standard\nscenario, in which CR positrons are secondaries formed by hadronic interactions\nbetween the primary CR protons and the interstellar medium (ISM). The positron\nexcess is therefore interpreted as evidence for either an annihilation/decay of\nweakly interacting massive particles, or for a direct astrophysical source of\npairs. The common feature of all proposed models is that they invoke new\nphysics or new astrophysical sources. However, this line of argumentation\nrelies implicitly on the assumption of a relatively homogeneous CR source\ndistribution. Inhomogeneity of CR sources on a scale of order a kpc, can\nnaturally explain this anomaly. If the nearest major CR source is about a kpc\naway, then low energy electrons (~GeV) can easily reach us. At higher energies\n(> 10 GeV), the source electrons cool via synchrotron and inverse-Compton\nbefore reaching the solar vicinity. Pairs formed in the local vicinity through\nthe proton/ISM interactions can reach the solar system also at high energies,\nthus increasing the positron/electron ratio. A natural origin of source\ninhomogeneity is the strong concentration of supernovae to the galactic spiral\narms. Assuming supernova remnants (SNRs) as the sole primary source of CRs, and\ntaking into account their concentration near the galactic spiral arms, we\nconsistently predict the observed positron fraction between 1 and 100 GeV,\nwhile abiding to different constraints such as the observed electron spectrum\nand the CRs cosmogenic age. An ATIC like spectral excess at ~600 GeV can be\nexplained, in this picture, as the contribution of a few known nearby SNRs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 May 2009 20:09:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-08"}

The strands undergo small-scale episodic heating and\nare coupled together through the frequency distribution of the total energy\ninput to the loop which follows a power law distribution with index ~ 2.29. The\nspatial preference of the swarm of heating events from apex to footpoint is\ninvestigated. From a theoretical perspective, the resulting emission measure\nweighted temperature profiles along these two extreme cases does demonstrate a\npossible observable difference. Subsequently, the simulated output is folded\nthrough the TRACE instrument response functions and a re-derivation of the\ntemperature using different filter-ratio techniques is performed. Given the\nmulti-thermal scenario created by this many strand loop model, a broad\ndifferential emission measure results; the subsequent double and triple filter\nratios are very similar to those obtained from observations.

Based on the current understanding,\naccording to which the structure-determining interaction in amorphous solids is\nthe hard-core repulsion while weaker, longer-range interactions are mere\nperturbations, the model yields the average coordination in the solid as a\nresult of a hyperquenching process where the instantaneous structure of the\nprecursor liquid snapshot is distorted to the same degree required to quench\nthe hard-sphere liquid into the isostatic jammed state at 64% volume fraction.\nThe characteristic length of distortion turns out to be about 3% of the\nparticle diameter.

Thus the\nmodel can be usefully employed to quantitatively assess the degree of\nstructural inhomogeneity in amorphous solids.

We analyzed a\n1-hour time series and a large-area map of Ca II H spectra on the traces of\npropagating waves.

We survey N V absorption in a sample of 91 DLAs and 18\nsub-DLAs in the redshift range 1.67<z<4.28 with unblended coverage of the N V\ndoublet, using data from VLT/UVES, Keck/HIRES, and Keck/ESI. In DLAs, we find\neight secure N V detections, four marginal detections, and 79 non-detections.\nThe detection rate of N V in DLAs is therefore 13^{+5}_{-4}%. Two sub-DLA N V\ndetections are found among a sample of 18, at a similar detection rate of\n11^{+15}_{-7}%. We show that the N V detection rate is a strong function of\nmetallicity, increasing by a factor of ~4 at [N/H]=[NI/HI]>-2.3. The N V and\nCIV component b-value distributions in DLAs are statistically similar, but the\nmedian b(N V) of 18 km/s is lower than the median b(O VI) of 25 km/s. Some ~20%\nof the N V components have b<10 km/s and thus arise in warm photoionized plasma\nat log (T/K)<4.92; local sources of ionizing radiation (as opposed to the\nextragalactic background) are required to keep the cloud sizes physically\nreasonable. The nature of the remaining ~80% of (broad) N V components is\nunclear; models of radiatively-cooling collisionally-ionized plasma at\nlog(T/K)=5.2-5.4 are fairly successful in reproducing the observed integrated\nhigh-ion column density ratios and the component line widths, but we cannot\nrule out photoionization by local sources. Finally, we identify several unusual\nDLAs with extremely low metallicity (<0.01 solar) but strong high-ion\nabsorption [log N(N V)>14 or log N(O VI)>14.2] that present challenges to\neither galactic inflow or outflow models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 May 2009 15:06:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2009 21:28:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Furthermore, the increase in size when\nconverting arbitrary PDAs accepting ultralinear languages to finite-turn PDAs\ncannot be bounded by any recursive function. The latter phenomenon is known as\nnon-recursive trade-off. In this paper, finite-turn PDAs accepting bounded\nlanguages are considered. First, letter-bounded languages are studied. We prove\nthat in this case the non-recursive trade-off is reduced to a recursive\ntrade-off, more precisely, to an exponential trade-off. A conversion algorithm\nis presented and the optimality of the construction is shown by proving tight\nlower bounds. Furthermore, the question of reducing the number of turns of a\ngiven finite-turn PDA is studied. Again, a conversion algorithm is provided\nwhich shows that in this case the trade-off is at most polynomial. Finally, the\nmore general case of word-bounded languages is investigated.

The S stars produce dust in their wind that bears a\nresemblance to the dust produced in some O-rich AGB stars. However, the\nreported resemblance is mostly based on IRAS/LRS spectra with limited spectral\nresolution, sensitivity, and wavelength coverage. We investigate the dust\ncomposition around S stars using ISO/SWS data that surpass the previous studies\nin terms of spectral resolution and wavelength coverage. We compare the dust\nspectra from the 9 sources with the O-rich AGB spectra and a subset of M\nsuper-giants. We constructed average dust emission spectra of the different\ncategories. We report the discovery of several previously unreported dust\nemission features in the S star spectra. The long wavelength spectra of W Aql\nand pi1 Gru exhibit the \"30\" micrometer feature attributed to MgS. Two sources\nexhibit a series of emission bands between 20 and 40 micrometer that we\ntentatively ascribe to Diopside. We show that the 10-20 micrometer spectra of\nthe S stars are significantly different from the O-rich AGB stars. The O-rich\nstars exhibit a structured emission feature that is believed to arise from\namorphous silicate and aluminium-oxide. The S stars lack the substructure found\nin the O-rich stars. Instead they show a smooth peak with a varying\npeak-position from source to source. We suggest that this feature is caused by\na family of related material, whose exact composition determines the peak\nposition. The observed trend mimics the laboratory trend of non-stoichiometric\nsilicates.
