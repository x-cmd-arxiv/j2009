The scale of SUSY breaking is the AdS radius, and the dual field\ntheory has explicitly broken supersymmetry. The large hierarchy of energy\nscales in these geometries is stable. We establish this by showing that the\ndual gauge theories do not have any relevant operators which are singlets under\nthe global symmetries. When the geometries are embedded in a compact internal\nspace, a large enough discrete subgroup of the global symmetries can still\nsurvive to prevent any singlet relevant operators from arising. We illustrate\nthis by embedding one case in a non-supersymmetric orbifold of a Calabi-Yau\nmanifold. These examples can serve as a starting point for obtaining\nRandall-Sundrum models in string theory, and more generally for constructing\ncomposite Higgs or technicolor-like models where strongly coupled dynamics\nleads to the breaking of electro-weak symmetry.

We examine the possibility that dark matter is hidden,\nthat is, neutral under all standard model gauge interactions, but charged under\nan exact U(1) gauge symmetry of the hidden sector. Such candidates are\npredicted in WIMPless models, supersymmetric models in which hidden dark matter\nhas the desired thermal relic density for a wide range of masses. Hidden\ncharged dark matter has many novel properties not shared by neutral dark\nmatter: (1) bound state formation and Sommerfeld-enhanced annihilation after\nchemical freeze out may reduce its relic density, (2) similar effects greatly\nenhance dark matter annihilation in protohalos at redshifts of z ~ 30, (3)\nCompton scattering off hidden photons delays kinetic decoupling, suppressing\nsmall scale structure, and (4) Rutherford scattering makes such dark matter\nself-interacting and collisional, potentially impacting properties of the\nBullet Cluster and the observed morphology of galactic halos. We analyze all of\nthese effects in a WIMPless model in which the hidden sector is a simplified\nversion of the minimal supersymmetric standard model and the dark matter is a\nhidden sector stau. We find that charged hidden dark matter is viable and\nconsistent with the correct relic density for reasonable model parameters and\ndark matter masses in the range 1 GeV < m_X < 10 TeV. At the same time, in the\npreferred range of parameters, this model predicts cores in the dark matter\nhalos of small galaxies and other halo properties that may be within the reach\nof future observations.

In [Li, Lin 2011], we offered a resolution of this paradox. The aim of\nthis paper is to provide a numerical implementation of the resolution. The main\nidea of the resolution is that even though the linear shear is linearly stable,\nslow orbits (also called quasi-steady states) in arbitrarily small\nneighborhoods of the linear shear can be linearly unstable. The key is that in\ninfinite dimensions, smallness in one norm does not mean smallness in all\nnorms. Our study here focuses upon a sequence of 2D oscillatory shears which\nare the Couette linear shear plus small amplitude and high frequency sinusoidal\nshear perturbations. In the fluid velocity variable, the sequence approaches\nthe Couette linear shear (e.g. in $L^2$ norm of velocity), thus it can be\nviewed as Couette linear shear plus small noises; while in the fluid vorticity\nvariable, the sequence does not approaches the Couette linear shear (e.g. in\n$H^1$ norm of velocity). Unlike the Couette linear shear, the sequence of\noscillatory shears has inviscid linear instability; furthermore, with the\nsequence of oscillatory shears as potentials, the Orr-Sommerfeld operator has\nunstable eigenvalues when the Reynolds number is large enough, this should lead\nto transient nonlinear growth which manifests as transient turbulence as\nobserved in experiments.

A compact summary of the logic\nand structure of the electroweak theory precedes an examination of what\nexperimental tests have established so far. The outstanding unconfirmed\nprediction of the electroweak theory is the existence of the Higgs boson, a\nweakly interacting spin-zero particle that is the agent of electroweak symmetry\nbreaking, the giver of mass to the weak gauge bosons, the quarks, and the\nleptons.

Indirect constraints from global analyses of\nelectroweak measurements suggest that the mass of the standard-model Higgs\nboson is less than 200 GeV.

If the reprocessor is Compton-thick, the calculation of\nemission-line and continuum spectra that are suitable for direct fitting to\nX-ray data is challenging because the reprocessed emission depends on the\nspectral shape of the incident continuum, which may not be directly observable.\nWe present new Monte-Carlo calculations of Green's functions for a toroidal\nreprocessor that provide significant improvements over currently available\nmodels. The Green's function approach enables the construction of X-ray\nspectral fitting models that allow arbitrary incident spectra as part of the\nfitting process. The calculations are fully relativistic and have been\nperformed for column densities that cover the Compton-thin to Compton-thick\nregime, for incident photon energies up to 500 keV.

We found no evidence of\nextended emission associated with the CCO, nor statistically significant\npulsations (the 3-sigma upper limit on pulsed fraction is about 16%).

The seller\nsets the prices on individual items. Each buyer buys a subset of yet unsold\nitems that maximizes her utility. Our goal is to design pricing strategies that\nguarantee an expected revenue that is within a small factor $\\alpha$ of the\nmaximum possible social welfare -- an upper bound on the maximum revenue that\ncan be generated. Most earlier work has focused on the unlimited supply\nsetting, where selling items to some buyer does not affect their availability\nto the future buyers. Balcan et. al. (EC 2008) studied the limited supply\nsetting, giving a randomized strategy that assigns a single price to all items\n(uniform strategy), and never changes it (static strategy), that gives an\n$2^{O(\\sqrt{\\log n \\log \\log n})}$-approximation, and moreover, no static\nuniform pricing strategy can give better than $2^{\\Omega(\\log^{1/4} n)}$-\napproximation. We improve this lower bound to $2^{\\Omega(sqrt{\\log n})}$.\n  We consider dynamic uniform strategies, which can change the price upon the\narrival of each buyer but the price on all unsold items is the same at all\ntimes, and static non-uniform strategies, which can assign different prices to\ndifferent items but can never change it after setting it initially. We design\nsuch pricing strategies that give a poly-logarithmic approximation to maximum\nrevenue. Thus in the limited supply setting, our results highlight a strong\nseparation between the power of dynamic and non-uniform pricing versus static\nuniform pricing. To our knowledge, this is the first non-trivial analysis of\ndynamic and non-uniform pricing schemes for revenue maximization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 May 2009 22:15:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-21"}

We claim that the only way that such HII regions can survive\naround the selected clusters, is if they are embedded into a high pressure ISM\nand if the majority of their mechanical energy is lost within the star cluster\nvolume via strong radiative cooling. The latter implies that these clusters\nhave a low heating efficiency, $\\eta$, and evolve in the bimodal hydrodynamic\nregime. In this regime the shock-heated plasma in the central zones of a\ncluster becomes thermally unstable, loses its pressure and is accumulated\nthere, whereas the matter injected by supernovae and stellar winds outside of\nthis volume forms a high velocity outflow - the star cluster wind. We\ncalculated the heating efficiency for each of the selected clusters and found\nthat in all cases it does not exceed 10% .

Although\nonly the short-range interaction is present in this model, we find\nunconventional soft gaps in the insulating phases irrespective of electron\nfilling, spatial dimensions and long-range order, where the single-particle\ndensity of states (DOS) vanishes with a power-law scaling in one dimension (1D)\nor even faster in two dimensions (2D) and three dimensions (3D) toward the\nFermi energy. We call it soft Hubbard gap. Moreover, exact-diagonalization\nresults in 1D support the formation of the soft Hubbard gap beyond the\nmean-field level. The formation of the soft Hubbard gap cannot be attributed to\na conventional theory by Efros and Shklovskii (ES) owing the emergence of soft\ngaps to the long-range Coulomb interaction. Indeed, based on a picture of\nmultivalley energy landscape, we propose a phenomenological scaling theory,\nwhich predicts a scaling of the DOS in perfect agreement with the numerical\nresults. We further discuss a correction of the scaling of the DOS by the\nlong-range part of the Coulomb interaction, which modifies the scaling of Efros\nand Shklovskii. Furthermore, explicit formulae for the temperature dependence\nof the DC resistivity via variable-range hopping under the influence of the\nsoft gaps are derived.

This effect may lead to a significant change in\nthe observed spectra of gamma-ray sources such as AGNs. Here we carry out a\ndetailed study that for the first time simultaneously considers in the same\nframework both the photon/axion mixing that takes place in the gamma-ray source\nand that one expected to occur in the intergalactic magnetic fields. An\nefficient photon/axion mixing in the source always means an attenuation in the\nphoton flux, whereas the mixing in the intergalactic medium may result in a\ndecrement and/or enhancement of the photon flux, depending on the distance of\nthe source and the energy considered. Interestingly, we find that decreasing\nthe value of the intergalactic magnetic field strength, which decreases the\nprobability for photon/axion mixing, could result in an increase of the\nexpected photon flux at Earth if the source is far enough. We also find a 30%\nattenuation in the intensity spectrum of distant sources, which occurs at an\nenergy that only depends on the properties of the ALPs and the intensity of the\nintergalactic magnetic field, and thus independent of the AGN source being\nobserved.

A wide range of model\nparameters, such as impurity occupancy, temperature, local Coulomb repulsion\nand hybridization strength, are studied. Results for the spin and charge\nsusceptibilities are presented. By comparing the static quantities to exact\nBethe ansatz results, it is shown that the description of the magnetic\nexcitations of the impurity within the ENCA is excellent, even in situations\nwith large valence fluctuations or vanishing Coulomb repulsion. The description\nof the charge susceptibility is quite accurate in situations where the singly\noccupied ionic configuration is the unperturbed ground state; however, it seems\nto overestimate charge fluctuations in the asymmetric model at too low\ntemperatures. The dynamic spin excitation spectra is dominated by the\nKondo-screening of the impurity spin through the conduction band, i.e. the\nformation of the local Kondo-singlet.

We show that on\nthe mean field or weak coupling level, the charge quadrupole contributes the\nlowest order modification to the contact value theorem and thus to the\nintersurface electrostatic interactions. The image effects are non-existent on\nthe mean-field level even with multipoles. On the strong coupling level the\nquadrupoles and higher order multipoles contribute additional terms to the\ninteraction free energy only in the presence of dielectric inhomogeneities.\nWithout them, the monopole is the only multipole that contributes to the strong\ncoupling electrostatics. We explore the consequences of these statements in all\ntheir generality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 May 2009 14:37:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

This increases the prediction for tan beta to moderately\nlarge values. Thus tan beta is related to the geometry of compact space.
