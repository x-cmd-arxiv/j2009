We adopt a minimal two-band tight-binding model with various\nchannels of pairing interaction, and derive a set of two-band Bogoliubov-de\nGennes (BdG) equations. The BdG equations are implemented in real space and\nthen solved self-consistently via exact diagonalization. In the uniform case,\nwe find that the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing state is most favorable for a\nnearest-neighbor pairing interaction while the $s_{x^2y^2}$-wave pairing state\nis most favorable for a next-nearest-neighbor pairing interaction. The is\nconsistent with that reported by Seo {\\em et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 101},\n206404 (2008)]. We then proceed to study the local electronic structure around\na magnetic vortex core for both $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave and $s_{x^2y^2}$-wave\npairing symmetry in the mixed state. It is found from the local density of\nstates (LDOS) spectra and its spatial variation that the resonance core states\nnear the Fermi energy for the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing symmetry are bound\nwhile those for the $s_{x^2y^2}$-wave pairing symmetry can evolve from the\nlocalized states into extended ones with varying electron filling factor.\nFurthermore, by including an effective exchange interaction, the emergent\nantiferromagnetic spin-density-wave (SDW) order can suppress the resonance core\nstates, which provides one possible avenue to understand the absence of\nresonance peak as revealed by recent scanning tunneling microscopy experiment\n(STM) by Yin {\\em et al.} [Phys.

Thus far, no prognostic model, neither\ntheoretical nor numerical, is able to exactly reproduce the line profiles of\nsharp line A and Am stars in that temperature range. In general, the helium\nabundance of A stars is not known from observations. Hence, we have considered\ntwo extreme cases for our simulations: a solar helium abundance as an upper\nlimit and zero helium abundance as a lower limit. The simulation for the helium\nfree case is found to differ from the case with solar helium abundance by\nlarger velocities, larger flow structures, and by a sign reversal of the flux\nof kinetic energy inside the hydrogen ionisation zone. Both simulations show\nextended shock fronts emerging from the optical surface, as well as mixing far\nbelow the region of partial ionisation of hydrogen, and vertical oscillations\nemerging after initial perturbations have been damped.

We prove that when these finite element pairs are applied to the\nlinear rotating shallow water equations, the geostrophically balanced states\nare exactly steady, which means that the numerical schemes do not introduce any\nspurious inertia-gravity waves; this makes these finite element pairs in some\nsense optimal for numerical weather prediction and ocean modelling\napplications. We further prove that these finite element pairs satisfy an\ninf-sup condition which means that they are free of spurious pressure modes\nwhich would pollute the numerical solution over the timescales required for\nlarge-scale geophysical applications.

Previous studies suggest a power-law\nform, with a \"universal\" value of the exponent, although some recent\nobservations indicate that significant sight line-to-sight line variability may\nexist. We show that a power-law model provides an excellent fit to most NIR\nextinction curves, but that the value of the power, beta, varies significantly\nfrom sight line-to-sight line. Therefore, it seems that a \"universal NIR\nextinction law\" is not possible. Instead, we find that as beta decreases, R(V)\n[=A(V)/E(B-V)] tends to increase, suggesting that NIR extinction curves which\nhave been considered \"peculiar\" may, in fact, be typical for different R(V)\nvalues. We show that the power law parameters can depend on the wavelength\ninterval used to derive them, with the beta increasing as longer wavelengths\nare included. This result implies that extrapolating power law fits to\ndetermine R(V) is unreliable. To avoid this problem, we adopt a different\nfunctional form for NIR extinction. This new form mimics a power law whose\nexponent increases with wavelength, has only 2 free parameters, can fit all of\nour curves over a longer wavelength baseline and to higher precision, and\nproduces R(V) values which are consistent with independent estimates and\ncommonly used methods for estimating R(V). Furthermore, unlike the power law\nmodel, it gives R(V)'s that are independent of the wavelength interval used to\nderive them. It also suggests that the relation R(V) = -1.36 E(K-V)/E(B-V) -\n0.79 can estimate R(V) to +/-0.12. Finally, we use model extinction curves to\nshow that our extinction curves are in accord with theoretical expectations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 May 2009 18:19:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-22"}

To\nthis end, Lewis' thesis of Humean supervenience is presented as an important\ncase study of an atomistic doctrine in philosophical thought. According to the\nthesis of Humean supervenience, the world is fragmented into local matters of\nparticular fact and everything else supervenes upon them in conjunction with\nthe spatiotemporal relations among them. It is explicitly shown that Lewis'\nontological doctrine of Humean supervenience incorporates at its foundation the\nso-called separability principle of classical physics. In view of the\nsystematic violation of the latter within quantum mechanics, it is argued that\ncontemporary physical science posits non-supervenient relations over and above\nthe spatiotemporal ones. It is demonstrated that the relation of quantum\nentanglement constitutes the prototypical example of a holistic, irreducible\nphysical relation that does not supervene upon a spatiotemporal arrangement of\nHumean qualities, undermining, thereby, the thesis of Humean supervenience. It\nis concluded, in this respect, that the assumption of ontological reductionism,\nas expressed in Lewis' Humean doctrine, cannot be regarded as a reliable code\nof the nature of the physical world and its contents.

The problem of state and parameter\nreconstruction is viewed within the classical framework of observer design.\nThis framework offers computationally-efficient solutions to the problem of\nstate and parameter reconstruction of a system of nonlinear differential\nequations, provided that these equations are in the so-called adaptive observer\ncanonic form. We show that despite typical neural oscillators being locally\nobservable they are not in the adaptive canonic observer form. Furthermore, we\nshow that no parameter-independent diffeomorphism exists such that the original\nequations of these models can be transformed into the adaptive canonic observer\nform. We demonstrate, however, that for the class of Hindmarsh-Rose and\nFitzHugh-Nagumo models, parameter-dependent coordinate transformations can be\nused to render these systems into the adaptive observer canonical form. This\nallows reconstruction, at least partially and up to a (bi)linear\ntransformation, of unknown state and parameter values with exponential rate of\nconvergence. In order to avoid the problem of only partial reconstruction and\nto deal with more general nonlinear models in which the unknown parameters\nenter the system nonlinearly, we present a new method for state and parameter\nreconstruction for these systems. The method combines advantages of standard\nLyapunov-based design with more flexible design and analysis techniques based\non the non-uniform small-gain theorems. Effectiveness of the method is\nillustrated with simple numerical examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 May 2009 21:03:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2010 09:30:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 18 Jun 2010 13:19:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

By introducing the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) phase of a\nboson field, we have been developing a unified model of dark energy (DE) and\ndark matter (DM) for the later mild acceleration. In this scenario, two phases\nof BEC (=DE) and normal gas (=DM) transform with each other through BEC phase\ntransition. This unified model has successfully explained the mild acceleration\nas an attractor. We extend this BEC cosmology to the early universe without\nintroducing new ingredients. In this scenario, the inflation is naturally\ninitiated by the condensation of the bosons in the huge vacuum energy. This\ninflation and even the cosmic expansion eventually terminates exactly at zero\nenergy density. We call this stage as stagflation. At this stagflation era,\nparticle production and the decay of BEC take place. The former makes the\nuniverse turn into the standard hot big bang stage and the latter makes the\ncosmological constant vanishingly small after the inflation. Furthermore, we\ncalculate the density fluctuations produced in this model, which turns out to\nbe in the range allowed by the present observational data.

Drawing inferences from\nresults obtained in optics and quantum communication research during the past\n10-15 years, we extract the core information about fields carrying orbital\nangular momentum. We show that with this information it is possible to design\nan array of antennas which, together with digital receivers/transmitters, can\nreadily produce, under full software control, a radio beam that carries\nelectromagnetic orbital angular momentum, a classical electrodynamics quantity\nknown for a century but so far preciously little utilized in radio, if at all.\nThis electromagnetic field is then optimized with the help of various antenna\narray techniques to improve the radio vector field qualities. By explicit\nnumerical solution of the Maxwell equations from first principles, using a de\nfacto industrial standard antenna software package, we show that the field\nindeed carries orbital angular momentum, and give a hint on how to detect and\nmeasure orbital angular momentum in radio beams.

In this paper we will show that there can be a flip side to this\nproperty which is quite fascinating and highly useful in many applications. As\na result, we can mix a large number of chaotic signals and one completely\narbitrary signal and later a recipient of this transformed and weighted mixture\ncan separate each of the signals, one by one. The chaotic signals, could be\ngenerated by various maps which belong to the logistic family. The arbitrary\nsignal, could be a message, some random noise, some periodic signal or a\nchaotic signal generated by a source, either belonging or not belonging to the\nfamily. The key behind this procedure is a family of maps which can dovetail\ninto each other without altering each of their predecessor's symbolic sequence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 May 2009 15:21:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-05"}

Firstly, causal sets are introduced as a simple\nkinematical model for causal geometry. It is shown how causal sets could\naccount for the microscopic origin of the Bekenstein entropy bound. Holography\nand finite entropy emerge naturally from the interplay between causality and\ndiscreteness. Going beyond causal set kinematics is problematic however. It is\na hard problem to find the right amplitude to attach to each causal set that\none needs to define the non-perturbative quantum dynamics of gravity. One\napproach which is ideally suited to define the non-perturbative gravitational\npath integral is dynamical triangulation. Without causality this method leads\nto unappealing features of the quantum geometry though. It is shown how\ncausality is instrumental in regulating this pathological behavior. In two\ndimensions this approach of causal dynamical triangulations has been\nanalytically solved by transfer matrix methods. In this thesis considerable\nprogress has been made in the development of more powerful techniques for this\napproach. The formulation through matrix models and a string field theory allow\nus to study interesting generalizations. Particularly, it has become possible\nto define the topological expansion. A surprising twist of the new matrix model\nis that it partially disentangles the large-N and continuum limit. This makes\nour causal model much closer in spirit to the original idea by 't Hooft than\nthe conventional matrix models of non-critical string theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 May 2009 15:23:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}

In the present paper we describe a group\ntheoretic condition under which Sunada's method gives manifolds with identical\ncovering spectra. When the group theoretic condition of our method is not met,\nwe are able to construct Sunada isospectral manifolds with distinct covering\nspectra in dimension 3 and higher. Hence, the covering spectrum is not a\nspectral invariant. The main geometric ingredient of the proof has an\ninterpretation as the minimum-marked-length-spectrum analogue of Colin de\nVerdi\\`{e}re's classical result on constructing metrics where the first $k$\neigenvalues of the Laplace spectrum have been prescribed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 May 2009 22:05:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 2010 18:18:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-29"}
