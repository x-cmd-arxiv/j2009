The core of a neutron star\nis considered to be a superfluid, superconductor type II. Flux expulsion of the\nmagnetic field out of the core of a single neutron star has been discussed by\nprevious authors. However, the evolution of the core magnetic field is\nsubstantially different for a binary neutron star. While for a single neutron\nstar the fluxoids of the proton superconductor always move outward through the\ncore, in a binary neutron star in the accretion phase fluxoids move back into\nthe core. The subsequent increase of the core magnetic field results in the\nincrease of the surface magnetic field. We ask weather within the framework of\nthis model the formation of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) is possible. We show\nthat despite the increase of the core magnetic field, MSPs are formed in this\nmodel. The evolution of the neutron star with various orbital periods, magnetic\nfields, spin periods, and other parameters are numerically investigated. The\nequation of state of the neutron star, initial orbital period of the binary,\nand other parameters of the binary have substantial effects on the evolution of\nperiod vs. magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 May 2009 19:33:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-05"}

This\nnew method, which falls under the general category of inverse scattering, is\nbased on a highly non-linear Fredholm integral equation relating the Earth\nstructure to itself and to the recorded seismograms. An iterative solution to\nthis equation is proposed. The resulting algorithm is numerically intensive but\nis deterministic, i.e., random searches of model space are not required and no\nmisfit function is needed. Impressive numerical results in 1D are shown for\nseveral test cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 May 2009 03:17:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-05"}

Especially, the\nsub-wavelength image calculated from measured far-field data demonstrates very\nclear resolution. Since metamaterials included with active elements can easily\nbehave strong nonlinearity under very weak incident electromagnetic powers, the\napplication of the nonlinear lens proposed in this paper would have important\npotential in improving the sub-wavelength resolution in the near future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 May 2009 14:13:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-05"}

Recently, this has been proposed as a method to average\nlocal measurement values by a distributed protocol (\"Consensus Propagation\",\nMoallemi & Van Roy, 2006), where the average is available for read-out at every\nsingle node. In the case that the underlying network is constant but the values\nto be averaged fluctuate (\"dynamic data\"), convergence and accuracy are\ndetermined by the spectral properties of an associated Ruelle-Perron-Frobenius\noperator. For Gaussian models on Erdos-Renyi graphs, numerical computation\npoints to a spectral gap remaining in the large-size limit, implying\nexceptionally good scalability. In a model where the underlying network also\nfluctuates (\"dynamic network\"), averaging is more effective than in the dynamic\ndata case. Altogether, this implies very good performance of these methods in\nvery large systems, and opens a new field of statistical physics of large (and\ndynamic) information systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 May 2009 15:26:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-10"}

Here, a systematic search for correlations between the X-ray\nspectral properties and the multiwavelength data was performed for the sources\nin CAIXA. All the significant (>99.9% confidence level) correlations are\ndiscussed along with their physical implications on current models of AGN. Two\nmain correlations are discussed in this paper: a) a very strong\nanti-correlation between the FWHM of the H$\\beta$ optical line and the ratio\nbetween the soft and the hard X-ray luminosity. Although similar\nanti-correlations between optical line width and X-ray spectral steepness have\nalready been discussed in the literature (see e.g., Laor et al. 1994, Boller et\nal. 1996, Brandt et al. 1997), we consider the formulation we present in this\npaper is more fundamental, as it links model-independent quantities. Coupled\nwith a strong anti-correlation between the V to hard X-ray flux ratio and the\nH$\\beta$ FHWM, it supports scenarios for the origin of the soft excess in AGN,\nwhich require strong suppression of the hard X-ray emission; b) a strong (and\nexpected) correlation between the X-ray luminosity and the black hole mass. Its\nslope, flatter than 1, is consistent with Eddington ratio-dependent bolometric\ncorrections, such as that recently proposed by Vasudevan & Fabian (2009).\nMoreover, we critically review through various statistical tests the role that\ndistance biases play in the strong radio to X-ray luminosity correlation found\nin CAIXA and elsewhere; we conclude that only complete, unbiased samples (such\nas that recently published by Behar & Laor, 2008) should be used to draw\nobservational constraints on the origin of radio emission in radio-quiet AGN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 May 2009 15:34:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 May 2009 08:34:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The onset of the exchange bias, between the ferromagnetic core\nand the anti-ferromagnetic CoO shell, is accompanied by a coercivity drop of\n0.2 T which leads to a minimum in coercivity at $\\sim100$ K. Magnetization\nrelaxation measurements show a temperature dependence of the magnetic viscosity\nS which is consistent with a volume distribution of the CoO grains at the\nsurface. We propose that the superparamagnetic fluctuations of the\nanti-ferromagnetic CoO shell play a key role in the flipping of the nanowire\nmagnetization and explain the coercivity drop. This is supported by\nmicromagnetic simulations. This behavior is specific to the geometry of a 1D\nsystem which possesses a large shape anisotropy and was not previously observed\nin 0D (spheres) or 2D (thin films) systems which have a high degree of symmetry\nand low coercivities. This study underlines the importance of the AFM\nsuper-paramagnetic fluctuations in the exchange bias mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 May 2009 15:54:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 May 2009 14:00:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2009 12:34:19 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2009 12:21:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-30"}
