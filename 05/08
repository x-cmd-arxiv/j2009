Line emission from polycyclic aromatic\nhydrocarbons (PAHs) at 3.3 micron alone cannot explain the excess, which can be\nfit by a spectral component consisting of a template of PAH emission lines\nsuperposed on a modified blackbody of temperature T~850 K. The luminosity of\nthis near-infrared excess emission at 3 micron is found to be correlated with\nthe star formation rate of the galaxy. The origin of the near-infrared excess\nis explored by examining similar excesses observed locally in massive star\nforming regions, reflection and planetary nebulae, post-asymptotic giant branch\nstars and in the galactic cirrus. We also consider the potential contribution\nfrom dust heated around low-luminosity active galactic nuclei.

H. Thomas, in his 1927 paper, \"The Kinematics of an Electron with an\nAxis\", explained the then-anomalous factor of one-half in atomic spin-orbit\ncoupling as due to a relativistic precession of the electron spin axis.\nThomas's explanation required also that the total of the orbit-averaged, or\n\"secular\", orbital and spin angular momenta of the electron be a conserved\nquantity, as he found to be the case for either of two possible equations of\ntranslational motion of the magnetic electron. Thomas's finding is seen in the\npresent work to require the \"hidden momentum\" of the electron intrinsic\nmagnetic moment in the Coulomb field of the proton be omitted from its equation\nof translational motion. Omission of the hidden momentum is contrary to the\nposition of standard modern electrodynamics texts, and leads to violation of\nNewton's law of action and reaction, negating Thomas's result. Including the\nhidden momentum results in linear momentum conservation, but in the presence of\nThomas precession, the total angular momentum is not generally conserved. The\ntotal angular momentum precesses for non-aligned spin and orbit, even in the\nabsence of externally-applied magnetic field.

Our MHD simulations show this type of flow and $\\Omega_\\phi(r)$ profile.\nThe first mode is a Rossby wave instability (RWI) mode which is radially\ntrapped in the vicinity of the maximum of a key function $g(r){\\cal F}(r)$ at\n$r_{R}$.

To better assess the long term evolution of these instabilities, we\nstudy the behavior of the non-neutral plasma with help on particle simulations.\n  We designed a 2D electrostatic PIC code. In the diocotron regime, the\nequation of motion for particles obeys the electric drift approximation. The\nplasma is confined between two conducting walls.

The derived mass loss rates and wind terminal\nvelocities are used to simulate the evolution of the circumstellar medium.

This is the most important energy range for absorbing $\\g$-rays from\ndistant sources such as blazars and gamma-ray bursts and producing electron\npositron pairs. In previous work we presented EBL models in the optical through\nultraviolet by consistently taking into account the star formation rate (SFR),\ninitial mass function (IMF) and dust extinction, and treating stars on the main\nsequence as blackbodies. This technique is extended to include post-main\nsequence stars and reprocessing of starlight by dust. In our simple model, the\ntotal energy absorbed by dust is assumed to be re-emitted as three blackbodies\nin the infrared, one at 40 K representing warm, large dust grains, one at 70 K\nrepresenting hot, small dust grains, and one at 450 K representing polycyclic\naromatic hydrocarbons.

In this scenario only\nthe youngest stellar complexes show a progression in age along the leading\nborder of the disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 May 2009 20:02:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

In this work\ncontrol landscapes for open quantum systems governed by Kraus map evolution are\nanalyzed. Kraus maps are used as the controls transforming an initial density\nmatrix $\\rho_{\\rm i}$ into a final density matrix to maximize the expectation\nvalue of the observable $\\Theta$. The absence of suboptimal local maxima for\nthe relevant control landscapes is numerically illustrated. The dependence of\nthe optimization search effort is analyzed in terms of the dimension of the\nsystem $N$, the initial state $\\rho_{\\rm i}$, and the target observable\n$\\Theta$. It is found that if the number of nonzero eigenvalues in $\\rho_{\\rm\ni}$ remains constant, the search effort does not exhibit any significant\ndependence on $N$. If $\\rho_{\\rm i}$ has no zero eigenvalues, then the\ncomputational complexity and the required search effort rise with $N$. The\ndimension of the top manifold (i.e., the set of Kraus operators that maximizes\nthe objective) is found to positively correlate with the optimization search\nefficiency. Under the assumption of full controllability, incoherent control\nmodelled by Kraus maps is found to be more efficient in reaching the same value\nof the objective than coherent control modelled by unitary maps. Numerical\nsimulations are also performed for control landscapes with linear constraints\non the available Kraus maps, and suboptimal maxima are not revealed for these\nlandscapes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 May 2009 23:51:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-11"}

We find that the classical equivalence between\nthese two theories can almost be extended to the Ramond sector: We construct\nmappings between the string fields (NS and Ramond, including Chan-Paton factors\nand the various GSO sectors) of the two theories that send solutions to\nsolutions in a way that respects the linearized gauge symmetries in both sides\nand keeps the action of the solutions invariant. The perturbative spectrum\naround equivalent solutions is also isomorphic.\n  The problem with the cubic theory implies that the correspondence of the\nlinearized gauge symmetries cannot be extended to a correspondence of the\nfinite gauge symmetries.

The present paper intends to\nbridge the gap between the existing theories as far as possible. We develop a\nstability and convergence theory for the residual method in general topological\nspaces. In addition, we prove convergence rates in terms of (generalized)\nBregman distances, which can also be applied to non-convex regularization\nfunctionals. We provide three examples that show the applicability of our\ntheory. The first example is the regularized solution of linear operator\nequations on $L^p$-spaces, where we show that the results of Tikhonov\nregularization generalize unchanged to the residual method. As a second\nexample, we consider the problem of density estimation from a finite number of\nsampling points, using the Wasserstein distance as a fidelity term and an\nentropy measure as regularization term. It is shown that the densities obtained\nin this way depend continuously on the location of the sampled points and that\nthe underlying density can be recovered as the number of sampling points tends\nto infinity.

We detect a total of 8 sources associated with the\nCartwheel galaxy and three in its vicinity, including G1 and G2, all at L >=\n10^39 erg/s, that is the Ultra Luminous X-ray (ULX) source range. The brightest\nULX source has been already discussed elsewhere. The spectra of the next three\nbrightest ULX are well fitted by a power-law model with a mean photon index of\n~2. We compare the XMM-Newton and Chandra datasets to study the long-term\nvariability of the sources. At least three sources vary in the 5 months between\nthe two XMM-Newton observations and at least four in the 4-year timeframe\nbetween Chandra and XMM-Newton observations. One Chandra source disappears and\na new one is detected by XMM-Newton in the ring. Optical-UV colors of the\nCartwheel ring are consistent with a burst of star formation that is close to\nreaching its maximum, yielding a mean stellar age of about 40 Myr. The inferred\nvariability and age suggest that high mass X-ray binaries are the counterparts\nto the ULX sources. The 3 companion galaxies have luminosities in the range\n10^39-40 erg/s consistent with expectations. The hot gas of the Cartwheel\ngalaxy is luminous and abundant (a few 10^8 Msol) and is found both in the\nouter ring, and in the inner part of the galaxy, behind the shock wave front.\nWe also detect gas in the group with L_X ~10^40 erg/s.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 May 2009 10:54:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Our model is based on a new dark matter sector with a U(1)'\ngauge symmetry plus a discrete symmetry added to the Standard Model of particle\nphysics. The new fields of the dark matter sector have no hadronic charges and\ncouple only to leptons. Our model can not only give rise to the observed\nneutrino mass hierarchy, but can also generate the baryon number asymmetry via\nnon-thermal leptogenesis. The breaking of the new U(1)' symmetry produces\ncosmic strings. The dark matter particles are produced non-thermally from\ncosmic string loop decay which allows one to obtain sufficiently large\nannihilation cross sections to explain the observed cosmic ray positron and\nelectron fluxes recently measured by the PAMELA, ATIC, PPB-BETS, Fermi-LAT, and\nHESS experiments while maintaining the required overall dark matter energy\ndensity. The high velocity of the dark matter particles from cosmic string loop\ndecay leads to a low phase space density and thus to a dark matter profile with\na constant density core in contrast to what happens in a scenario with\nthermally produced cold dark matter where the density keeps rising towards the\ncenter. As a result, the flux of gamma rays radiated from the final leptonic\nstates of dark matter annihilation from the Galactic center is suppressed and\nsatisfies the constraints from the HESS gamma-ray observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 May 2009 13:51:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-15"}

This is the case irrespective of whether one assumes characteristic\nfrequencies appropriate for a stellar mass (10 M_sun) or an intermediate mass\n(1000 M_sun) black hole, and means that in some ULXs the variability is\nsignificantly suppressed compared to bright BHBs and AGN.

However, some\nrecent studies have found more similarities than differences between the SEDs\nof LINERs and those of more luminous AGNs, suggesting that LINERs are powered\nby the same mechanisms active in higher luminosity AGNs. Our new observations\nallow us to test this idea. In particular, XRT affords long and sensitive\nmonitoring of the X-ray emission. We detect significant variability in M81 and,\nfor the first time, in NGC 3998. The maximum amplitude variations over time\nscales of some hours are 30% in both M81 and NGC 3998.

The identification of NGC 3998 with a low power AGN\nappears more viable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 May 2009 14:23:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-30"}

With real-time traffic data regarding travel times, it is important\nto analyze how to use the information provided. In particular, can a Wardrop\nequilibrium be realized? Simulations using the three-phase model on a two-route\nexample are presented to answer this question. One route (the main line) is a\ntwo-lane highway with a stalled vehicle in the right lane and the other route\nis a low-speed bypass. For a critical incoming flow, a phase transition between\nfree flow and congested flow near the stalled vehicle is observed, making this\na challenging example. In the first scenario, drivers choose routes selfishly\non the basis of current travel times. The result is strong oscillations in\ntravel time because of the inherent delay in the information provided. The\nsecond scenario involves a hypothetical control system that limits the number\nof vehicles on the main line to prevent the free-flow to congested-flow phase\ntransition by diverting sufficient flow to the bypass. The resulting steady\nstate is neither a Wardrop equilibrium nor a system optimum, but an\nintermediate state in which the main-line travel time is less than on the\nbypass but the average for all vehicles is close to a minimum. In a third\nscenario, anticipation is used as a driver-advice system to provide a fair\nindicator of which route to take. Prediction is based on real-time data\ncomparing the number of vehicles on the main line at the time a vehicle leaves\nthe origin to the actual travel time when it reaches the destination.

For\nLandau-Ginzburg models in the same universality class as nonlinear sigma\nmodels, we explicitly check that the elliptic genera of the Landau-Ginzburg\nmodels match that of the nonlinear sigma models, via a Thom class computation\nof a form analogous to that appearing in recent studies of other properties of\nLandau-Ginzburg models on nontrivial spaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 May 2009 15:34:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 27 Oct 2013 22:45:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-04"}

From the well identified gamma-ray sources to\nthose without any obvious counterpart and the putative Galactic diffuse\nemission, this observational window fully deserves to be celebrated during this\nInternational Year of Astronomy, as a new mean to image the Galaxy and reveal\nsites of particle acceleration, potentially at the origin of Galactic cosmic\nrays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 May 2009 15:41:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-11"}

The\nmain result is that for a fixed integer n, there is a positive density set of\nprimes p such that PSL_2(F_{p^n}) occurs as the Galois group of some finite\nextension of the rational numbers. These groups are obtained as projective\nimages of residual modular Galois representations. Moreover, families of\nmodular forms are constructed such that the images of all their residual Galois\nrepresentations are as large as a priori possible. Both results essentially use\nKhare's and Wintenberger's notion of good-dihedral primes. Particular care is\ntaken in order to exclude nontrivial inner twists.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 May 2009 15:54:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-11"}
