We start with the assumption that incomes are\ndetermined both by individual labour and by stochastic effects of trading and\ninvestment. The income from personal effort alone is distributed about a mean,\nwhile the income from trade, which may be positive or negative, is proportional\nto the trader's income. These assumptions lead to a Langevin model with\nmultiplicative noise, from which we derive a Fokker-Planck (FP) equation for\nthe income probability density function (IPDF) and its variation in time. We\nfind that high earners have a power-law income distribution while the low\nincome groups have a Levy IPDF. Comparing our analysis with the Indian survey\ndata (obtained from the world bank website) taken over many years we obtain a\nnear-perfect data collapse onto our model's equilibrium IPDF. The theory\nquantifies the economic notion of \"given other things\". Using survey data to\nrelate the IPDF to actual food consumption we define a poverty index, which is\nconsistent with traditional indices, but independent of an arbitrarily chosen\n\"poverty line\" and therefore less susceptible to manipulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 May 2009 16:31:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-23"}

From the dynamical\npoint of view, the transition signals the emergence of nonuniform\nhyperbolicity, so the dependence of the Lyapunov exponent with respect to\nparameters plays a central role in the analysis. Though often ill-behaved by\nconventional measures, we show that the Lyapunov exponent is in fact remarkably\nregular in a ``stratified sense'' which we define: the irregularity comes from\nthe matching of nice (analytic or smooth) functions along sets with complicated\ngeometry. This result allows us to stablish that the ``critical set'' for the\ntransition has at most codimension one, so for a typical potential the set of\ncritical energies is at most countable, hence typically not seen by spectral\nmeasures. Key to our approach are two results about the dependence of the\nLyapunov exponent of one-frequency $\\SL(2,\\C)$ cocycles with respect to\nperturbations in the imaginary direction: on one hand there is a severe\n``quantization'' restriction, and on the other hand ``regularity'' of the\ndependence characterizes uniform hyperbolicity when the Lyapunov exponent is\npositive. Our method is independent of arithmetic conditions on the frequency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 May 2009 18:20:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-26"}

We start by\ndefining several constructions on those games and show, using elementary\nconsiderations, that they enjoy the appropriate algebraic properties making\nthis category a denotational model for intuitionistic linear logic. An\ninteresting point is that the tensor product corresponds to a strongly\nsynchronous operation on games.

We confirm that simple spectral\nmodels commonly used for the analysis and interpretation of ULXs (power-law\ncontinuum and multi-colour disc blackbody models) are inadequate in the face of\nsuch high quality data. Instead we find two near ubiquitous features in the\nspectrum: a soft excess and a roll-over in the spectrum at energies above 3keV.\nWe investigate a range of more physical models to describe these data. We find\nthat disc plus Comptonised corona models fit the data well, but the derived\ncorona is cool, and optically thick (tau ~ 5-30). We argue that these observed\ndisc temperatures are not a good indicator of the black hole mass as the\npowerful, optically thick corona drains energy from the inner disc, and\nobscures it. We estimate the intrinsic (corona-less) disc temperature, and\ndemonstrate that in most cases it lies in the regime of stellar mass black\nholes. These objects have spectra which range from those similar to the highest\nmass accretion rate states in Galactic binaries, to those which clearly have\ntwo peaks, one at energies below 1 keV (from the outer, unComptonised disc) and\none above 3 keV (from the Comptonised, inner disc). However, a few ULXs have a\nsignificantly cooler corrected disc temperature; we suggest that these are the\nmost extreme stellar mass black hole accretors, in which a massive wind\ncompletely envelopes the inner disc regions, creating a cool photosphere. We\nconclude that ULXs provide us with an observational template for the transition\nbetween Eddington and super-Eddington accretion flows, with the latter\noccupying a new ultraluminous accretion state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 May 2009 08:43:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Specifically, we formulate this problem as a finite-horizon\nMarkov decision process (MDP) by explicitly considering the users'\nheterogeneous multimedia traffic characteristics (e.g. delay deadlines,\ndistortion impacts and dependencies etc.), time-varying network conditions as\nwell as, importantly, their ability to adapt their cross-layer transmission\nstrategies in response to these dynamics. Based on the heterogeneous\ncharacteristics of the media packets, we are able to express the transmission\npriorities between packets as a new type of directed acyclic graph (DAG). This\nDAG provides the necessary structure for determining the optimal cross-layer\nactions in each time slot: the root packet in the DAG will always be selected\nfor transmission since it has the highest positive marginal utility; and the\ncomplexity of the proposed cross-layer solution is demonstrated to linearly\nincrease w.r.t. the number of disconnected packet pairs in the DAG and\nexponentially increase w.r.t. the number of packets on which the current\npackets depend on.

The star's photometric properties are derived\nfrom detailed studies of the period variability and of all available light\ncurves. We find that over about 56 years the orbital period of the system has\nvaried due to a combination of an upward parabola and a sinusoid rather than in\na monotonic fashion. Mass transfer from the less massive primary to the more\nmassive secondary component is likely responsible for at least a significant\npart of the secular period change. The cyclical variation with a period of 7.57\nyrs and a semi-amplitude of 0.0015 d can be produced either by a\nlight-travel-time effect due to an unseen companion with a scaled mass of $M_3\n\\sin i_3$=0.081 $M_\\odot$ or by a magnetic period modulation in the secondary\nstar. Historical light curves of AR Boo, as well as our own, display\nseason-to-season light variability, which are best modeled by including both a\ncool spot and a hot one on the secondary star. We think that the spots express\nmagnetic dynamo-related activity and offer limited support for preferring the\nmagnetic interpretation of the 7.57-year cycle over the third-body\nunderstanding.

They allow us to study the extent to which a node takes part when\ninformation is passed around the network. Nodes with high betweenness may be\nregarded as key players that have a highly active role. At one extreme,\nbetweenness has been defined by considering information passing only through\nthe shortest paths between pairs of nodes. At the other extreme, an alternative\ntype of betweenness has been defined by considering all possible walks of any\nlength. In this work, we propose a betweenness measure that lies between these\ntwo opposing viewpoints. We allow information to pass through all possible\nroutes, but introduce a scaling so that longer walks carry less importance.\nThis new definition shares a similar philosophy to that of communicability for\npairs of nodes in a network, which was introduced by Estrada and Hatano (Phys.\nRev. E 77 (2008) 036111). Having defined this new communicability betweenness\nmeasure, we show that it can be characterized neatly in terms of the\nexponential of the adjacency matrix. We also show that this measure is closely\nrelated to a Frechet derivative of the matrix exponential. This allows us to\nconclude that it also describes network sensitivity when the edges of a given\nnode are subject to infinitesimally small perturbations. Using illustrative\nsynthetic and real life networks, we show that the new betweenness measure\nbehaves differently to existing versions, and in particular we show that it\nrecovers meaningful biological information from a protein-protein interaction\nnetwork.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 May 2009 00:42:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-02"}

We show that the\nluminosity function of type Ia supernova host galaxies matches well with that\nof galaxies in the general field, suggesting that the occurrence of type Ia\nsupernovae does not favour a particular type of galaxies but is predominantly\nproportional to the luminosity of galaxies. The only evidence that points to\npossible correlation between the supernova rate and star formation activity is\nthat the supernova rate in late-type galaxies is higher than that in early-type\ngalaxies by 31+/-35%. The sample contains 8 type Ia supernovae whose host\ngalaxies were not identified, but it is shown that their occurrence is\nconsistent with them occurred in low luminous galaxies beyond the survey. The\nluminosity function of type Ia supernovae is approximately Gaussian with the\nfull-width half maximum being a factor of 1.4 in luminosity. The Gaussian\ndistribution becomes tighter if the ratio of extinction to reddening, R_V, is\nlower than the characteristic value for the Milky Way and if luminosity is\ncorrected for the light curve shape. The colour excess is ~0.07 mag which is\nsignificantly smaller than reddening expected for field galaxies. This colour\nexcess does not vary with the distance of the supernovae from the centre of the\nhost galaxy to 15 kpc. This suggests that the major part of the colour excess\nappears to be either intrinsic or reddening that arises in the immediate\nenvironment of supernova, rather than interstellar reddening in host galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 May 2009 06:53:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

This rule is known as edge local complementation (ELC), and has the\neffect of modifying the Tanner graph while preserving the code. We have\npreviously shown how the ELC operation can be used to implement an iterative\npermutation group decoder (SPA-PD)--one of the most successful iterative\nsoft-decision decoding strategies at small blocklengths. In this work, we\nexploit the fact that ELC can also give structurally distinct parity-check\nmatrices for the same code. Our aim is to describe a simple iterative decoder,\nrunning SPA-PD on distinct structures, based entirely on random usage of the\nELC operation. This is called SPA-ELC, and we focus on small blocklength codes\nwith strong algebraic structure. In particular, we look at the extended Golay\ncode and two extended quadratic residue codes. Both error rate performance and\naverage decoding complexity, measured by the average total number of messages\nrequired in the decoding, significantly outperform those of the standard SPA,\nand compares well with SPA-PD. However, in contrast to SPA-PD, which requires a\nglobal action on the Tanner graph, we obtain a performance improvement via\nlocal action alone. Such localized algorithms are of mathematical interest in\ntheir own right, but are also suited to parallel/distributed realizations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 May 2009 11:11:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

We propose a new methodology for\ngeneralizing measures of unweighted networks through a generalization of the\ncardinality concept of a set of weights. The key observation here is that many\nmeasures of unweighted networks use the cardinality (the size) of some subset\nof edges in their computation. For example, the node degree is the number of\nedges incident to a node. We define the effective cardinality, a new metric\nthat quantifies how many edges are effectively being used, assuming that an\nedge's weight reflects the amount of interaction across that edge. We prove\nthat a generalized measure, using our method, reduces to the original\nunweighted measure if there is no disparity between weights, which ensures that\nthe laws that govern the original unweighted measure will also govern the\ngeneralized measure when the weights are equal. We also prove that our\ngeneralization ensures a partial ordering (among sets of weighted edges) that\nis consistent with the original unweighted measure, unlike previously developed\ngeneralizations. We illustrate the applicability of our method by generalizing\nfour unweighted network measures. As a case study, we analyze four real-world\nweighted networks using our generalized degree and clustering coefficient. The\nanalysis shows that the generalized degree distribution is consistent with the\npower-law hypothesis but with steeper decline and that there is a common\npattern governing the ratio between the generalized degree and the traditional\ndegree. The analysis also shows that nodes with more uniform weights tend to\ncluster with nodes that also have more uniform weights among themselves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 May 2009 11:23:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2009 08:42:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 28 Nov 2010 08:51:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-22"}

The rods consist of a hard spherocylindrical backbone\nsurrounded with a square-well potential to account for attractive (or soft\nrepulsive) interactions. Long-ranged chiral interactions are described by means\nof a simple pseudo-scalar potential which is appropriate for weak chiral forces\nof a predominant electrostatic origin. Based on the formalism proposed by\nStraley [Phys. Rev. A {\\bf 14}, 1835 (1976)] we derive explicit algebraic\nexpressions for the twist elastic modulus and the cholesteric pitch for rods as\na function of density and temperature. The pitch varies non-monotonically with\ndensity, with a sharp decrease at low packing fractions and a marked increase\nat higher packing fractions. A similar trend is found for the temperature\ndependence. The unwinding of the helical pitch at high densities (or low\ntemperatures) originates from a marked increase in the local nematic order and\na steep increase of the twist elastic resistance associated with near-parallel\nlocal rod configurations. This contrasts with the commonly held view that the\nincrease in pitch with decreasing temperature as often observed in cholesterics\nis due to layer formation resulting from pre-smectic fluctuations. The increase\nin pitch with increasing temperature is consistent with an entropic unwinding\nas the chiral interaction becomes less and less significant than the thermal\nenergy.

This system is unusual for ultracool dwarfs with detectable radio\nemission, in exhibiting a lack of any large scale variability, particularly the\nbursting (periodic or aperiodic) behavior exhibited by the other objects with\ndetectable levels of radio emission. We explore the constraints that the lack\nof variability on long and short timescales, and flat spectral index, imply\nabout the radio-emitting structures and mechanism. The temporal constraints\nargue for a high latitude emitting region with a large inclination so that it\nis always in view, and survives for at least 0.6 year. Temporal constraints\nalso limit the plasma conditions, implying that the electron density be n_e\n<4x10^5 cm-3 and B < 130 G in order not to see time variations due to\ncollisional or radiative losses from high energy particles. The observations\nand constraints provided by them are most compatible with a nonthermal radio\nemission mechanism, likely gyrosynchrotron emission from a spatially\nhomogeneous or inhomogeneous source. This indicates that, similar to behaviors\nnoted for chromospheric, transition region, and coronal plasmas in ultracool\ndwarfs, the magnetic activity patterns observed in active higher mass stars can\nsurvive to the substellar boundary.
