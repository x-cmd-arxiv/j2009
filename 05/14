In order to test the relative importance of a variety of SSP model\ningredients, we compare our SSP models with integrated spectra of 41 Milky Way\nGlobular Clusters (MWGCs) from Schiavon et al.

Using the Mg b and\nCa4227 indices, we confirm that Mg and Ca are enhanced by about +0.4 and +0.2\ndex, respectively, in agreement with results from high resolution spectra of\nindividual stars in MWGCs. Balmer lines, particularly Hgamma and Hdelta, of\nMWGCs are reproduced by our alpha-enhanced SSP models not only because of the\ncombination of isochrone and spectral effects but also because of our\nreasonable HB treatment. Moreover, it is shown that the Mg abundance\nsignificantly influences Balmer and iron line indices. Finally, the\ninvestigation of power-law initial mass function (IMF) variations suggests that\nan IMF much shallower than Salpeter is unrealistic because the Balmer lines are\ntoo strong on the metal-poor side to be compatible with observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 May 2009 17:29:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2009 18:56:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 4 Sep 2009 18:52:39 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2009 20:35:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The\nSchmidt-Kennicutt law emerges naturally for star-forming disks and starbursts.\nWe predict that there should be an inverse correlation between Tully-Fisher law\nand Schmidt-Kennicutt law residuals. The model is extended to include a\nmulti-phase treatment of supernova feedback that leads to a turbulent\npressure-regulated generalization of the star formation law and is applicable\nto gas-rich starbursts. Enhanced pressure, as expected in merger-induced star\nformation, enhances star formation efficiency. An upper limit is derived for\nthe disk star formation rate in starbursts that depends on the ratio of global\nISM to cloud pressures. We extend these considerations to the case where the\ninterstellar gas pressure in the inner galaxy is dominated by outflows from a\ncentral AGN. During massive spheroid formation, AGN-driven winds trigger star\nformation, resulting in enhanced supernova feedback and outflows. The outflows\nare comparable to the AGN-boosted star formation rate and saturate in the\nsuper-Eddington limit. Downsizing of both SMBH and spheroids is a consequence\nof AGN-driven positive feedback. Bondi accretion feeds the central black hole\nwith a specific accretion rate that is proportional to the black hole mass.\nAGN-enhanced star formation is mediated by turbulent pressure and relates\nspheroid star formation rate to black hole accretion rate.

While application scientists have been able to\nreadily gather multi-neuronal datasets, analysis capabilities have lagged\nbehind, due to both lack of powerful algorithms and inaccessibility to powerful\nhardware platforms. The advent of GPU architectures such as Nvidia's GTX 280\noffers a cost-effective option to bring these capabilities to the\nneuroscientist's desktop. Rather than port existing algorithms onto this\narchitecture, we advocate the need for algorithm transformation, i.e.,\nrethinking the design of the algorithm in a way that need not necessarily\nmirror its serial implementation strictly. We present a novel implementation of\na frequent episode discovery algorithm by revisiting \"in-the-large\" issues such\nas problem decomposition as well as \"in-the-small\" issues such as data layouts\nand memory access patterns. This is non-trivial because frequent episode\ndiscovery does not lend itself to GPU-friendly data-parallel mapping\nstrategies. Applications to many datasets and comparisons to CPU as well as\nprior GPU implementations showcase the advantages of our approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 May 2009 21:18:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-15"}

Recently, much work has been devoted to determining\nthe network design with optimal robustness. However, little attention has been\npaid to the problem of how to improve the robustness of existing networks. In\nthis paper, we present a new parameter alpha, called enforcing parameter, to\nguide the process of enhancing the robustness of scale-free networks by\ngradually adding new links. Intuitively, alpha < 0 means the nodes with lower\ndegrees are selected preferentially while the nodes with higher degrees will be\nmore probably selected when alpha > 0. It is shown both theoretically and\nexperimentally that when alpha < 0 the attack survivability of the network can\nbe enforced apparently. Then we propose new strategies to enhance the network\nrobustness. Through extensive experiments and comparisons, we conclude that\nestablishing new links between nodes with low degrees can drastically enforce\nthe attack survivability of scale-free networks while having little impact on\nthe error tolerance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 May 2009 00:50:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The linear theory predicts\ninstability for any amplitude of the primary wave. For strong primary waves the\nmost unstable modes are perpendicular to the primary wave, which correspond to\ngeneration of a zonal flow if the primary wave is purely meridional. For weaker\nwaves, the maximum growth occurs for off-zonal inclined modulations. For very\nweak primary waves the unstable waves are close to being in three-wave\nresonance with the primary wave. The nonlinear theory predicts that the zonal\nflows generated by the linear instability experience pinching into narrow zonal\njets. Our numerical simulations confirm the theoretical predictions of the\nlinear theory as well as of the nonlinear pinching. We find that, for strong\nprimary waves, these narrow zonal jets further roll up into Karman-like vortex\nstreets. On the other hand, for weak primary waves, the growth of the unstable\nmode reverses and the system oscillates between a dominant jet and a dominate\nprimary wave. The 2D vortex streets appear to be more stable than purely 1D\nzonal jets, and their zonal-averaged speed can reach amplitudes much stronger\nthan is allowed by the Rayleigh-Kuo instability criterion for the 1D case.

For this purpose, we calculate baryon and dark matter (DM) dynamics in\nspherical symmetry, incorporating the self-shielding effects by solving the\nradiative transfer of UV radiation. In addition, we prescribe the star\nformation in cooled gas components and pursue the dynamics of formed stars. As\na result, we find that the evolution of subgalactic objects in UV background\nradiation are separated into three types, that is, (1) prompt star formation,\nwhere less massive clouds ~10^{5-8} M_sun are promptly self-shielded and\nundergo star formation, (2) delayed star formation, where photoionized massive\nclouds >10^8 M_sun collapse despite high thermal pressure and are eventually\nself-shielded to form stars in a delayed fashion, and (3) supersonic infall,\nwhere photoionized less massive clouds ~10^{5-8} M_sun contract with supersonic\ninfall velocity and are self-shielded when a compact core forms. In particular,\nthe type (3) is a novel type found in the present simulations, and eventually\nproduces a very compact star cluster. The resultant mass-to-light ratios,\nhalf-mass radii, and velocity dispersions for the three types are compared to\nthe observations of GCs, dwarf spheroidals (dSphs), and ultra-compact dwarfs\n(UCDs). It turns out that the properties of star clusters resulting from\nsupersonic infall match well with those of observed GCs, whereas the other two\ntypes are distinct from GCs.

The genus, being an intrinsic topology\nmeasure, is resistant against the non-linear gravitational evolution, galaxy\nbiasing, and redshift-space distortion effects, and thus is ideal for\nquantifying the primordial topology of the large-scale structure. The expansion\nhistory of the universe can be constrained by comparing among the genus\nmeasured at different redshifts.

We show that a possible\nresolution of these difficulties, suggested by the ideas of Bohr, emerges if\ninstead of single projections one considers elementary propositions to be\nfamilies of projections indexed by a partially ordered set C(A) of appropriate\ncommutative subalgebras of A. In fact, to achieve both maximal generality and\nease of use within topos theory, we assume that A is a so-called Rickart\nC*-algebra and that C(A) consists of all unital commutative Rickart\nC*-subalgebras of A. Such families of projections form a Heyting algebra in a\nnatural way, so that the associated propositional logic is intuitionistic:\ndistributivity is recovered at the expense of the law of the excluded middle.\n  Subsequently, generalizing an earlier computation for n-by-n matrices, we\nprove that the Heyting algebra thus associated to A arises as a basis for the\ninternal Gelfand spectrum (in the sense of Banaschewski-Mulvey) of the\n\"Bohrification\" of A, which is a commutative Rickart C*-algebra in the topos of\nfunctors from C(A) to the category of sets.

Two simulations are performed: A 2D simulation, with a\nsimulation plane that includes the direction of higher temperature,\ndemonstrates that the wave spectrum is initially confined to one dimension. The\nelectric field components in the simulation plane generated by the instability\nequalize at the end of the simulation through a secondary instability. A 1D PIC\nsimulation with a high resolution, where the simulation box is aligned with the\nwave vectors of the growing waves, reveals details of the electron phase space\ndistribution and permits a comparison of the magnetic and electric fields when\nthe instability saturates.

For\nexample, it gives only probabilistic predictions (non-determinism) and does not\nallow copying of unknown state (no-cloning). Quantum correlations may be\nstronger than any classical ones, nevertheless information cannot be\ntransmitted faster than light (no-signaling). However, all these features do\nnot single out quantum physics. A broad class of theories exist which share\nsuch traits with quantum mechanics, while they allow even stronger than quantum\ncorrelations. Here, we introduce the principle of Information Causality. It\nstates that information that Bob can gain about a previously completely unknown\nto him data set of Alice, by using all his local resources (which may be\ncorrelated with her resources) and a classical communication from her, is\nbounded by the information volume of the communication. In other words, if\nAlice communicates m bits to Bob, the total information access that Bob gains\nto her data is not greater than m. For m=0, Information Causality reduces to\nthe standard no-signaling principle. We show that this new principle is\nrespected both in classical and quantum physics, whereas it is violated by all\nthe no-signaling correlations which are stronger that the strongest quantum\ncorrelations. Maximally strong no-signalling correlations would allow Bob\naccess to any m bit subset of the whole data set held by Alice. If only one bit\nis sent by Alice (m=1), this is tantamount to Bob being able to access the\nvalue of any single bit of Alice's data (but of course not all of them). We\nsuggest that Information Causality, a generalization of no-signaling, might be\none of the foundational properties of Nature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 May 2009 09:50:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2009 10:34:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 6 May 2010 11:24:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Goppa. Given a smooth projective algebraic\ncurve X over a finite field, there are two different constructions of\nerror-correcting codes. The first one, called \"functional\", uses some rational\nfunctions on X and the second one, called \"differential\", involves some\nrational 1-forms on this curve. Hundreds of papers are devoted to the study of\nsuch codes.\n  In addition, a generalization of the functional construction for algebraic\nvarieties of arbitrary dimension is given by Y. Manin in an article of 1984. A\nfew papers about such codes has been published, but nothing has been done\nconcerning a generalization of the differential construction to the\nhigher-dimensional case.\n  In this thesis, we propose a differential construction of codes on algebraic\nsurfaces. Afterwards, we study the properties of these codes and particularly\ntheir relations with functional codes. A pretty surprising fact is that a main\ndifference with the case of curves appears. Indeed, if in the case of curves, a\ndifferential code is always the orthogonal of a functional one, this assertion\ngenerally fails for surfaces. Last observation motivates the study of codes\nwhich are the orthogonal of some functional code on a surface. Therefore, we\nprove that, under some condition on the surface, these codes can be realized as\nsums of differential codes. Moreover, we show that some answers to some open\nproblems \"a la Bertini\" could give very interesting informations on the\nparameters of these codes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 May 2009 14:28:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-24"}

Integrating out these fermions at tree level we derive general\nformulae that can be used in any model containing such particles. We apply\nthese formulae to the case of the lightest Kaluza-Klein (KK) fermions in a\nRandall-Sundrum (RS) model with a custodial protection of flavour conserving\n$Zd_L^i d_L^i$ and flavour violating $Zd_L^i d_L^j$ couplings. We point out\nthat in this model also the couplings of $Zu_R^i u_R^i$ and $Zu_R^i u_R^j$ are\nprotected. In particular we demonstrate explicitly that this protection is not\nspoiled by the mixing of the SM quarks with the KK fermions, which is\nguaranteed by the underlying P_LR symmetry. We find that the impact of KK\nfermions on the Z-couplings, while not negligible, is significantly smaller\nthan the one coming from the mixing of Z with the heavy KK gauge bosons Z_H and\nZ'.The situation is similar for the W couplings with the only exception of the\ntb coupling where the impact of KK fermions can in principle be larger than the\neffects that are induced by gauge boson mixing. We also show explicitly that at\nO(v^2/M_{KK}^2) the fermion-Higgs couplings of a Higgs placed on the infrared\n(IR) brane is not affected by the KK contributions up to strongly chirally\nsuppressed contributions. The corrections to the CKM matrix, in particular the\nbreakdown of its unitarity, are found to be small. We also investigate the\nright-handed couplings of W that are generated through the mixing with\nKK-fermions and introduce a 3x3 matrix that describes the pattern of flavour\nviolation in these new interactions of the standard W.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 May 2009 12:49:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Jun 2009 12:15:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2009 12:09:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-11"}

Despite extensive characterization of this regulatory network, the\norigin of the extreme stability of the lysogenic state remains unclear. We have\nconstructed a stochastic model for this switch. Using Forward Flux Sampling\nsimulations, we show that this model predicts an extremely low rate of\nspontaneous prophage induction in a recA mutant, in agreement with experimental\nobservations. In our model, the DNA loop formed by octamerization of CI bound\nto the O_L and O_R operator regions is crucial for stability, allowing the\nlysogenic state to remain stable even when a large fraction of the total CI is\ndepleted by nonspecific binding to genomic DNA. DNA looping also ensures that\nthe switch is robust to mutations in the order of the O_R binding sites. Our\nresults suggest that DNA looping can provide a mechanism to maintain a stable\nlysogenic state in the face of a range of challenges including noisy gene\nexpression, nonspecific DNA binding and operator site mutations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 May 2009 13:37:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

We discuss a recent model based on S4 where Bimaximal\nmixing is instead valid at leading order and the large corrections needed to\nreproduce the data arise from the diagonalization of charged leptons. The value\nof $\\theta_{13}$ could distinguish between the two alternatives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 May 2009 15:20:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-15"}

To\nvalidate the absence of system hazards concerning dysfunctional interactions,\nindustrials call for approaches of modeling system safety requirements and\ninteraction constraints among components and with environments (e.g., between\nhumans and machines).

This framework differs from the framework\nof the traditional model checking. It explicitly separates the tasks of product\nengineers and safety engineers, and provides a top-down technique for modeling\na system with safety constraints, and for automatically composing a safe system\nthat conforms to safety requirements.

Be star/X-ray binary systems contain a Be star and a\nneutron star. They are found to have non-zero eccentricities and there is\nevidence that some systems have a misalignment between the spin axis of the\nstar and the spin axis of the binary orbit. The eccentricities in these systems\nare thought to be caused by a kick to the neutron star during the supernova\nthat formed it. Such kicks would also give rise to misalignments. In this paper\nwe investigate the extent to which the same kick distribution can give rise to\nboth the observed eccentricity distribution and the observed misalignments. We\nfind that a Maxwellian distribution of velocity kicks with a low velocity\ndispersion, $\\sigma_k \\approx 15\\rm km s^{-1}$, is consistent with the observed\neccentricity distribution but is hard to reconcile with the observed\nmisalignments, typically $i \\ge 25^\\circ$. Alternatively a higher velocity kick\ndistribution, $\\sigma_k = 265 \\rm km s^{-1}$, is consistent with the observed\nmisalignments but not with the observed eccentricities, unless post-supernova\ncircularisation of the binary orbits has taken place. We discuss briefly how\nthis might be achieved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 May 2009 15:54:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}
