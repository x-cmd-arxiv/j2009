Using Monte Carlo simulations, we confirm that gains in GW energy\nsensitivity of N^{1/2} are possible, where N is the number of stacked SGR\nbursts.

Although the majority of extraplanar gas in the first few\nkiloparsecs above the plane of a spiral galaxy is matter that has been expelled\nfrom the thin disk, the feedback-driven expulsion does not destroy dust grains\naltogether (and there is not yet any good measure suggesting it changes the\ndust-to-gas mass ratio). Direct optical imaging of a majority of edge-on spiral\ngalaxies shows large numbers of dusty clouds populating the thick disk to\nheights z~2 kpc. These observations are likely revealing a cold, dense phase of\nthe thick disk interstellar medium. New observations in the mid-infrared show\nemission from traditional grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in\nthe thick disks of spiral galaxies. PAHs are found to have large scale heights\nand to arise both in the dense dusty clouds traced through direct optical\nimaging and in the diffuse ionized gas. In this contribution, we briefly\nsummarize these probes of dust in the thick disks of spiral galaxies. We also\nargue that not only can dust can be used to trace extraplanar material that has\ncome from within the thick disk, but that its absence can be a marker for newly\naccreted matter from the circumgalactic or intergalactic medium. Thus,\nobservations of dust can perhaps provide a quantitative measure of the\nimportance of \"outflow versus infall\" in spiral galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2009 19:51:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The\nstructure factors are used to validate a microscopic linear mixing rule that is\nvalid for arbitrarily complex plasmas over a wide range of Coulomb couplings.\nThe microscopic mixing rule in turn implies and validates the linear mixing\nrule for the equation of state properties and also the linear mixing rule for\nthe electrical and thermal conductivities of dense multi-component plasmas. To\nmake our result as useful as possible, for the specific cases of electrical and\nthermal conductivities, we provide a simple analytic fit that is valid for\narbitrarily complex multi-component plasmas over a wide range of Coulomb\ncouplings. We compute the thermal conductivity for a representative\ncompositional profile of the outer crust of an accreting neutron star in which\nhundreds of nuclear species can be present. We utilize our results to\nre-examine the so-called impurity parameter formalism as used to characterize\nimpure plasmas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2009 23:51:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2009 21:07:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-28"}

The melting properties are calculated for\npressures ranging from ambient to several Mbar. The model is intended to be the\nsimplest possible tight-binding representation of the two basic parts of the\nenergy: first, the pairwise repulsion due to Fermi exclusion; and second, the\nd-band bonding energy described in terms of an electronic density of states\nthat depends on structure. In addition to the number of d-electrons, the model\ncontains four parameters, which are adjusted to fit the pressure dependent\nd-band width and the zero-temperature pressure-volume relation of Mo. We show\nthat the resulting model reproduces well the phonon dispersion relations of Mo\nin the body-centred-cubic structure, as well as the radial distribution\nfunction of the high-temperature solid and liquid given by earlier\nfirst-principles simulations. Our free-energy calculations start from the free\nenergy of the liquid and solid phases of the purely repulsive pair-potential\nmodel, without d-band bonding. The free energy of the full tight-binding model\nis obtained from this by thermodynamic integration. The resulting melting\nproperties of the model are quite close to those given by earlier\nfirst-principles work on Mo.

We compare the ranges found in the NUHM1\nand NUHM2 with that found in the MSSM with universal supersymmetry-breaking\ncontributions to all scalar masses, the CMSSM. We find that both the NUHM1 and\nNUHM2 offer the possibility of larger spin-independent dark matter scattering\ncross sections than in the CMSSM for larger neutralino masses, since they allow\nthe density of heavier neutralinos with large Higgsino components to fall\nwithin the allowed range by astrophysics. The NUHM1 and NUHM2 also offer more\npossibilities than the CMSSM for small cross sections for lower neutralino\nmasses, since they may be suppressed by scalar and pseudoscalar Higgs masses\nthat are larger than in the CMSSM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 May 2009 15:51:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-28"}

Moreover, the module is further assumed\nto have a highest weight submodule, the \"left module\", and that the quotient by\nthis submodule yields another highest weight module, the \"right module\". Such\nmodules, which have been called staggered, have appeared repeatedly in the\nlogarithmic conformal field theory literature, but their theory has not been\nexplored in full generality. Here, such a theory is developed for the Virasoro\nalgebra using rather elementary techniques. The focus centres on two different\nbut related questions typically encountered in practical studies: How can one\nidentify a given staggered module, and how can one demonstrate the existence of\na proposed staggered module. The text is liberally peppered throughout with\nexamples illustrating the general concepts. These have been carefully chosen\nfor their physical relevance or for the novel features they exhibit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 May 2009 15:59:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2010 18:08:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-12"}
