Despite being local in 3+1 dimensions, the resulting cosmological\nevolution is remarkably similar to that of the full 4+1-dimensional DGP\nframework, both for the expansion history and the evolution of density\nperturbations. As in the DGP model, the covariant galileon theory yields two\nbranches of solutions, depending on the sign of the galileon velocity.\nPerturbations are stable on one branch and ghost-like on the other. An\ninteresting effect uncovered in our analysis is a cosmological version of the\nVainshtein screening mechanism: at early times, the galileon dynamics are\ndominated by self-interaction terms, resulting in its energy density being\nsuppressed compared to matter or radiation; once the matter density has\nredshifted sufficiently, the galileon becomes an important component of the\nenergy density and contributes to dark energy. We estimate conservatively that\nthe resulting expansion history is consistent with the observed late-time\ncosmology, provided that the scale of modification satisfies r_c > 15 Gpc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 May 2009 17:42:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 May 2009 17:23:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2009 21:07:33 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2009 13:46:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-13"}

At the special case when the\ntheory admits a unique maximally symmetric solution, a conformally flat space\nthat contains black holes and gravitational solitons for any value of the\ncosmological constant is found. For negative cosmological constant, the black\nhole is characterized in terms of the mass and the \"gravitational hair\"\nparameter, providing a lower bound for the mass. For negative mass parameter,\nthe black hole acquires an inner horizon, and the entropy vanishes at the\nextremal case. Gravitational solitons and kinks, being regular everywhere, are\nobtained from a double Wick rotation of the black hole. A wormhole solution in\nvacuum that interpolates between two static universes of negative spatial\ncurvature is obtained as a limiting case of the gravitational soliton with a\nsuitable identification. The black hole and the gravitational soliton fit\nwithin a set of relaxed asymptotically AdS conditions as compared with the ones\nof Brown and Henneaux. In the case of positive cosmological constant the black\nhole possesses an event and a cosmological horizon, whose mass is bounded from\nabove. Remarkably, the temperatures of the event and the cosmological horizons\ncoincide, and at the extremal case one obtains the analogue of the Nariai\nsolution, $dS_{2}\\times S^{1}$. A gravitational soliton is also obtained\nthrough a double Wick rotation of the black hole. The Euclidean continuation of\nthese solutions describes instantons with vanishing Euclidean action. For\nvanishing cosmological constant the black hole and the gravitational soliton\nare asymptotically locally flat spacetimes. The rotating solutions can be\nobtained by boosting the previous ones in the $t-\\phi$ plane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 May 2009 18:59:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Jul 2009 03:33:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-28"}

This supports the\nidea that stellar sources can account for the dust observed but show that the\ncontribution of AGB stars to dust production cannot be neglected, even at the\nmost extreme redshifts currently accessible to observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 May 2009 20:00:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Moreover, these galaxies are commonly found to be\nultra-compact with half-light radii of ~1 kpc. We have obtained a ~29 hr\nspectrum of a typical quiescent, ultra-dense galaxy at z=2.1865 with the Gemini\nNear-Infrared Spectrograph. The spectrum exhibits a strong optical break and\nseveral absorption features, which have not previously been detected in z>2\nquiescent galaxies. Comparison of the spectral energy distribution with stellar\npopulation synthesis models implies a low star formation rate (SFR) of 1-3\nMsol/yr, an age of 1.3-2.2 Gyr, and a stellar mass of ~2x10^11 Msol. We detect\nseveral faint emission lines, with emission-line ratios of [NII]/Halpha,\n[SII]/Halpha and [OII]/[OIII] typical of low-ionization nuclear emission-line\nregions. Thus, neither the stellar continuum nor the nebular emission implies\nactive star formation. The current SFR is <1% of the past average SFR. If this\ngalaxy is representative of compact quiescent galaxies beyond z=2, it implies\nthat quenching of star formation is extremely efficient and also indicates that\nlow luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) could be common in these objects.\nNuclear emission is a potential concern for the size measurement. However, we\nshow that the AGN contributes <8% to the rest-frame optical emission. A\npossible post-starburst population may affect size measurements more strongly;\nalthough a 0.5 Gyr old stellar population can make up <10% of the total stellar\nmass, it could account for up to ~40% of the optical light.

In part, this difficulty is due to our poor understanding of the in\nvivo efficacy of CD8$^+$T cells. Using a recently developed experimental method\nof in vivo cytotoxicity we investigated quantitative aspects of killing of\npeptide-pulsed targets by effector and memory CD8$^+$T cells, specific to three\nepitopes of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), in the mouse spleen. By\nanalyzing data on killing of targets with varying number of epitope-specific\neffector and memory CD8$^+$T cells, we find that killing of targets by\neffectors follows the law of mass-action, that is the death rate of\npeptide-pulsed targets is proportional to the frequency of CTLs in the spleen.\nIn contrast, killing of targets by memory CD8$^+$T cells does not follow the\nmass action law because the death rate of targets saturates at high frequencies\nof memory CD8$^+$T cells. For both effector and memory cells, we also find no\nsupport for a killing term that includes the decrease of the death rate of\ntargets with increasing target cell density. Importantly, we find that at low\nCD8$^+$T cell frequencies, effector and memory CD8$^+$T cells on the per capita\nbasis are equally efficient at killing peptide-pulsed targets. Our framework\nprovides the guideline for the calculation of the level of memory CD8$^+$T\ncells required to provide sterilizing protection against viral infection. Our\nresults thus form a basis for quantitative understanding of the process of\nkilling of virus-infected cells by T cell responses in tissues and can be used\nto correlate the phenotype of vaccine-induced memory CD8 T cells with their\nkilling efficacy in vivo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 May 2009 21:29:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-13"}

As it is\nthe mode height (and not the amplitude) that fixes the S/N at which the modes\ncan be measured, and as $g$ changes only slowly along the main sequence, this\nsuggests that stars cooler than the Sun might be as good targets for\nasteroseismology as their hotter counterparts.

For each node v the endpoints of the\nedges incident to v are uniquely identified by different integer labels called\nport numbers.

The MSA problem\nis considered NP-hard and known heuristics for the problem do not scale well\nwith increasing number of sequences. On the other hand, with the advent of new\nbreed of fast sequencing techniques it is now possible to generate thousands of\nsequences very quickly. For rapid sequence analysis, it is therefore desirable\nto develop fast MSA algorithms that scale well with the increase in the dataset\nsize. In this paper, we present a novel domain decomposition based technique to\nsolve the MSA problem on multiprocessing platforms. The domain decomposition\nbased technique, in addition to yielding better quality, gives enormous\nadvantage in terms of execution time and memory requirements. The proposed\nstrategy allows to decrease the time complexity of any known heuristic of\nO(N)^x complexity by a factor of O(1/p)^x, where N is the number of sequences,\nx depends on the underlying heuristic approach, and p is the number of\nprocessing nodes. In particular, we propose a highly scalable algorithm,\nSample-Align-D, for aligning biological sequences using Muscle system as the\nunderlying heuristic. The proposed algorithm has been implemented on a cluster\nof workstations using MPI library. Experimental results for different problem\nsizes are analyzed in terms of quality of alignment, execution time and\nspeed-up.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 May 2009 01:04:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-13"}

The symmetric capacity within O(1) is characterized for\nthe symmetric case where all direct links have the same signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR) and all undesired links have the same interference-to-noise ratio (INR).\nThe gap to the exact capacity is a constant which is independent of SNR and\nINR. To get this result, we first generalize the deterministic interference\nchannel introduced by El Gamal and Costa to model interference channels with\nmultiple antennas. We derive the capacity region of this deterministic\ninterference channel. Based on the insights provided by the deterministic\nchannel, we characterize the generalized degrees of freedom (GDOF) of Gaussian\ncase, which directly leads to the O(1) capacity approximation. On the\nachievability side, an interesting conclusion is that the generalized degrees\nof freedom (GDOF) regime where treating interference as noise is found to be\noptimal in the 2 user interference channel, does not appear in the N+1 user, 1\nx N SIMO case.

We\nhave mapped it in 352 GHz continuum, SiO (J=8-7), and HCO+ (J=4-3) emission at\nup to ~ 0.2\" resolution with the Submillimeter Array (SMA). The continuum\nsource is now resolved into two sources, SMM1 and SMM2, with a separation of ~\n84 AU. SMM1 is seen at the center of the jet, probably tracing a (inner) dusty\ndisk around the protostar driving the jet. SMM2 is seen to the southwest of\nSMM1 and may trace an envelope-disk around a small binary companion. A\nflattened envelope-disk is seen in HCO+ around SMM1 with a radius of ~ 80 AU\nperpendicular to the jet axis. Its velocity structure is consistent with a\nrotation motion and can be fitted with a Keplerian law that yields a mass of ~\n50+-15 Jupiter mass (a mass of a brown dwarf) for the protostar. Thus, the\nprotostar could be the lowest mass source known to have a collimated jet and a\nrotating flattened envelope-disk. A small-scale (~ 200 AU) low-speed (~ 2 km/s)\noutflow is seen in HCOP+ around the jet axis extending from the envelope-disk.\nIt seems to rotate in the same direction as the envelope-disk and may carry\naway part of the angular momentum from the envelope-disk. The jet is seen in\nSiO close to ~ 100 AU from SMM1. It is seen with a \"C-shaped\" bending. It has a\ntransverse width of <~ 40 AU and a velocity of ~ 170+-60 km/s. A possible\nvelocity gradient is seen consistently across its innermost pair of knots, with\n~ 0.5 km/s at ~ 10 AU, consistent with the sense of rotation of the\nenvelope-disk. If this gradient is an upper limit of the true rotational\ngradient of the jet, then the jet carries away a very small amount of angular\nmomentum of ~ 5 AU km/s and thus must be launched from the very inner edge of\nthe disk near the corotation radius.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 May 2009 01:23:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

If not\nproperly anonymized, patterns can actually be derived from the published data\nand be used by the adversary to breach individual privacy.

In general, it is hard to compute the competition number\nk(G) for a graph G and it has been one of important research problems in the\nstudy of competition graphs to characterize a graph by computing its\ncompetition number.\n  It is well known that there exist 5 kinds of regular polyhedra in the three\ndimensional Euclidean space: a tetrahedron, a hexahedron, an octahedron, a\ndodecahedron, and an icosahedron.

The observational\ncharacteristics of the different stages of ram pressure stripping are\npresented. The dynamical models yield the 3D velocity vectors of the galaxies,\npeak ram pressures, and times to peak ram pressure. In the case of a smooth,\nstatic, and spherical intracluster medium, peak ram pressure occurs during the\ngalaxy's closest approach to the cluster center, i.e. when the galaxy's\nvelocity vector is perpendicular to its distance vector from the cluster center\n(M 87). Assuming this condition the galaxy's present line-of-sight distance and\nits 3D position during peak ram pressure can be calculated. The linear orbital\nsegments derived in this way together with the intracluster medium density\ndistribution derived from X-ray observations give estimates of the ram pressure\nthat are on average a factor of 2 higher than derived from the dynamical\nsimulations for NGC 4501, NGC 4330, and NGC 4569.

By using three different\nlevels of description - (i) a simple mean field, (ii) a more detailed\nmean-field description in terms of a (self-organized) branching processes, and\n(iii) a full stochastic representation in terms of a Langevin equation-, it is\nshown on general grounds that non-conserving dynamics does not lead to bona\nfide criticality. Contrarily to conserving systems, a parameter, which we term\n\"re-charging\" rate (e.g. the tree-growth rate in forest-fire models), needs to\nbe fine-tuned in non-conserving systems to obtain criticality. In the infinite\nsize limit, such a fine-tuning of the loading rate is easy to achieve, as it\nemerges by imposing a second separation of time-scales but, for any finite\nsize, a precise tuning is required to achieve criticality and a coherent\nfinite-size scaling picture. Using the approaches above, we shed light on the\ncommon mechanisms by which \"apparent criticality\" is observed in non-conserving\nsystems, and explain in detail (both qualitatively and quantitatively) the\ndifference with respect to true criticality obtained in conserving systems. We\npropose to call this self-organized quasi-criticality (SOqC). Some of the\nreported results are already known and some of them are new. We hope the\nunified framework presented here helps to elucidate the confusing and\ncontradictory literature in this field.

Applying in-plane magnetic vector fields up to 100\nmT, the magnetotransport properties are ascertained during growth. With\nincreasing thickness the films exhibit a gradual transition from tunneling\nmagnetoresistance to anisotropic magnetoresistance. This corresponds to the\nevolution of the film structure from separated small islands to a network of\ninterconnected grains as well as the transition from superparamagnetic to\nferromagnetic behavior of the film.

For polar PAHs, pure rotational\ntransitions can be used as fingerprints for identification. Combining dedicated\nexperiments, detailed simulations and observations, we explored the mm domain\nto search for specific rotational transitions of corannulene (C20H10). We\nperformed high-resolution spectroscopic measurements and a simulation of the\nemission spectrum of UV-excited C20H10 in the environment of the Red Rectangle,\ncalculating its synthetic rotational spectrum. Based on these results, we\nconducted a first observational campaign at the IRAM 30m telescope towards this\nsource to search for several high-J rotational transitions of (C20H10). The\nlaboratory detection of the J = 112 <- 111 transition of corannulene showed\nthat no centrifugal splitting is present up to this line. Observations with the\nIRAM 30m telescope towards the Red Rectangle do not show any corannulene\nemission at any of the observed frequencies, down to a rms noise level of Tmb =\n8 mK for the J =135 -> 134 transition at 137.615 GHz. Comparing the noise level\nwith the synthetic spectrum, we are able to estimate an upper limit to the\nfraction of carbon locked in corannulene of about 1.0x10(-5) relative to the\ntotal abundance of carbon in PAHs. The sensitivity achieved shows that radio\nspectroscopy can be a powerful tool to search for polar PAHs. We compare this\nupper limit with models for the PAH size distribution, emphasising that small\nPAHs are much less abundant than predicted. We show that this cannot be\nexplained by destruction but is more likely related to the chemistry of their\nformation in the environment of the Red Rectangle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 May 2009 13:44:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 May 2009 07:48:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

With the WSRT, we detect a large reservoir of neutral hydrogen in the\nproximity of IC 2497. One cloud complex with a total mass of 5.6E9 Msol to the\nSouth of IC 2497, encompasses Hanny's Voorwerp. Another cloud complex is\nlocated at the position of a small galaxy group ~100 kpc to the West of IC 2497\nwith a mass of 2.9E9 Msol. Our data hint at a physical connection between both\ncomplexes. We also detect HI in absorption against the central continuum source\nof IC 2497. Our observations strongly support the hypothesis that Hanny's\nVoorwerp is being ionised by an AGN in the centre of IC 2497. In this scenario,\na plasma jet associated with the AGN, clears a path through the ISM/IGM in the\ndirection towards the nebulosity. The large-scale radio continuum emission\npossibly originates from the interaction between this jet and the large cloud\ncomplex that Hanny's Voorwerp is embedded in. The HI kinematics do not fit\nregular rotation, thus the cloud complex around IC 2497 is probably of tidal\norigin. From the HI absorption against the central source, we derive a lower\nlimit of 2.8E21 +- 0.4E21 atoms/sqcm to the HI column density.

The objective functions are the errors\nof least squares parameter estimation subject to a constraint on the number of\nsubsections of the quantized signals or the expectation of the optimal code\nlength for either high or low resolution. In the high-resolution case, the\noptimal quantizer is found by solving Euler-Lagrange's equations and the\nsolutions are simple functions of the probability densities of the regressor\nvector. In order to clarify the minute structure of the quantization, the\noptimal quantizer in the low resolution case is found by solving recursively a\nminimization of a one-dimensional rational function. The solution has the\nproperty that it is coarse near the origin of its input and becomes dense away\nfrom the origin in the usual situation. Finally the required quantity of data\nto decrease the total parameter estimation error, caused by quantization and\nnoise, is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 May 2009 15:00:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-13"}

The Galactic halo could have been formed from the dissolution of\nglobular clusters prior to their intermediate mass stars reaching the AGB. The\nsecond population has enhanced Na and Al accompanied by lower O and by higher\n26Mg/Mg (~8%), consistent with models which do incorporate ejecta from AGB\nstars via normal stellar winds. All the M71 giants have identical [Fe/H],\n[Si/Fe], [Ca/Fe], [Ti/Fe] and [Ni/Fe] to within sigma = 0.04 dex (10%).

Consistently, the\nstatistical analysis of positions and ages of clusters in the Milky Way disk\nstrongly suggests that a correlation between the duration of star formation in\na region and its size does exist. The average age difference between pairs of\nopen clusters increases with their separation as the ~0.16 power. In contrast\nand for the Large Magellanic Cloud, Efremov & Elmegreen (1998) found that the\nage difference scales with the ~0.35 power of the region size. This discrepancy\nmay be tentatively interpreted as an argument in support of intrinsically\nshorter (faster) star formation time-scales in smaller galaxies. However, if\nboth the effects of cluster dissolution and incompleteness are taken into\nconsideration, the average age difference between cluster pairs in the Galaxy\nincreases with their separation as the ~0.4 power. This result implies that the\ncharacteristic time-scale for coherent, clustered-mode star formation is nearly\n1 Myr. Therefore, the overall consequence of ignoring the effect of cluster\ndissolution is to overestimate the star formation time-scale. On the other\nhand, in the Galactic disk and for young clusters separated by less than three\ntimes the characteristic cluster tidal radius (10 pc), the average age\ndifference is 16 Myr, which suggests common origin.
