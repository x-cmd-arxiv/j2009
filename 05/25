Supposed periodicities in the fossil record, impact cratering\ndates or climate proxies over the Phanerozoic (past 545 Myr) are frequently\ncited as evidence in support of these hypotheses. This remains a controversial\nsubject, with many refutations and replies having been published. Here I review\nboth the mechanisms and the evidence for and against the relevance of\nastronomical phenomena to climate change and evolution.

Some of the studies have suffered from flaws in\nmethodology, in particular drawing incorrect conclusions based on ruling out a\nnull hypothesis. I conclude that there is little evidence for intrinsic\nperiodicities in biodiversity, impact cratering or climate on timescales of\ntens to hundreds of Myr.

This work is an\nextension of Moscibrodzka & Proga (2008), where we investigated the gamma\ndependence of 2-D Bondi-like accretion flows in the hydrodynamical (HD) limit.\nOur main goal is to study if simulations for various gamma can give us insights\ninto to the problem of various modes of accretion observed in several types of\naccretion systems such as black hole binaries (BHB), active galactic nuclei\n(AGN), and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We find that for gamma >~ 4/3, the fast\nrotating flow forms a thick torus that is supported by rotation and gas\npressure. As shown before for gamma=5/3, such a torus produces a strong,\npersistent bipolar outflow that can significantly reduce the polar funnel\naccretion of a slowly rotating flow. For low gamma, close to 1, the torus is\nthin and is supported by rotation. The thin torus produces an unsteady outflow\nwhich is too weak to propagate throughout the polar funnel inflow. Compared to\ntheir HD counterparts, the MHD simulations show that the magnetized torus can\nproduce an outflow and does not exhibit regular oscillations. Generally, our\nsimulations demonstrate how the torus thickness affects the outflow production.\nThey also support the notion that the geometrical thickness of the torus\ncorrelates with the power of the torus outflow. Our results, applied to\nobservations, suggest that the torus ability to radiatively cool and become\nthin can correspond to a suppression of a jet as observed in the BHB during a\ntransition from a hard/low to soft/high spectral state and a transition from a\nquiescent to hard/low state in AGN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 May 2009 20:21:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2009 18:02:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

For t >= 1 the\nt-pebbling number of a graph is the minimum number of pebbles necessary so that\nfrom any initial distribution of them it is possible to move t pebbles to any\nvertex. We provide the best possible upper bound on the t-pebbling number of a\ndiameter two graph, proving a conjecture of Curtis, et al., in the process.

First we perform a next-to-leading order QCD study; we\ncalculate the distributions in four different bins of dijet invariant mass\nusing different Monte Carlo programs and different jet algorithms, and we also\ninvestigate the systematic uncertainties coming from the choice of the parton\ndistribution functions and the renormalization and factorization scales. In the\nsecond part of this paper, we present the effects on the distributions coming\nfrom a model including gravitational scattering and black hole formation in a\nworld with large extra dimensions. Assuming a 25% systematic uncertainty, we\nreport a discovery potential for the mass bin $1 < M_{jj} < 2$ TeV at 10\npb$^{-1}$ integrated luminosity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 May 2009 07:45:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2009 16:19:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-14"}

Methods: We derive\ntypical galaxian metallicities (using the well known metallicity-luminosity\nrelation) and local metallicities, i.e. at the position of the SN; in the\nlatter case, we use the empirical fact that the metallicity gradients in disk\ngalaxies are ~ constant when expressed in dex/R25.

Although it is not difficult to state its content in terms of certain\nanalytic properties relating different matrixelements of the S-matrix or\nformfactors, its relation to the localization- and positive energy spectral\nprinciples requires a level of insight into the inner workings of QFT which\ngoes beyond anything which can be found in typical textbooks on QFT. This paper\npresents a recent account based on new ideas derived from \"modular\nlocalization\" including a mathematic appendix on this subject.

The main content of this\narticle is the presentation of the derailments of particle theory during more\nthan 4 decades: the S-matrix bootstrap, the dual model and its string theoretic\nextension.

Indirect reciprocity is one such\nmechanism, where other-regarding actions of a player are eventually rewarded by\nother players with whom the original player has not interacted. The upstream\nreciprocity (also called generalized indirect reciprocity) is a type of\nindirect reciprocity and represents the concept that those helped by somebody\nwill help other unspecified players. In spite of the evidence for the\nenhancement of helping behavior by upstream reciprocity in rats and humans,\ntheoretical support for this mechanism is not strong. In the present study, we\nnumerically investigate upstream reciprocity in heterogeneous contact networks,\nin which the players generally have different number of neighbors. We show that\nheterogeneous networks considerably enhance cooperation in a game of upstream\nreciprocity. In heterogeneous networks, the most generous strategy, by which a\nplayer helps a neighbor on being helped and in addition initiates helping\nbehavior, first occupies hubs in a network and then disseminates to other\nplayers.

This physical model allows calculating the\ninfluence of interference on any mobile in a cell, whatever its position.\nResults obtained with that closed-form formula are close to the ones obtained\nby simulations using a traditional hexagonal network model.

The three methods address different problems, and hence share\ndifferent kinds of information between tasks or feature classes, but all three\nare based on the information theoretic Minimum Description Length (MDL)\nprinciple and share the same underlying Bayesian interpretation. The first\nmethod, MIC, applies when predictive models are to be built simultaneously for\nmultiple tasks (``simultaneous transfer'') that share the same set of features.\nMIC allows each feature to be added to none, some, or all of the task models\nand is most beneficial for selecting a small set of predictive features from a\nlarge pool of features, as is common in genomic and biological datasets. Our\nsecond method, TPC (Three Part Coding), uses a similar methodology for the case\nwhen the features can be divided into feature classes. Our third method,\nTransfer-TPC, addresses the ``sequential transfer'' problem in which the task\nto which we want to transfer knowledge may not be known in advance and may have\ndifferent amounts of data than the other tasks. Transfer-TPC is most beneficial\nwhen we want to transfer knowledge between tasks which have unequal amounts of\nlabeled data, for example the data for disambiguating the senses of different\nverbs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches with experimental\nresults on real world data pertaining to genomics and to Word Sense\nDisambiguation (WSD).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 May 2009 14:29:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-26"}
