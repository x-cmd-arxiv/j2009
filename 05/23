Mathematical optimization can be used as a computational tool to\nobtain the optimal solution to a given problem in a systematic and efficient\nway. For example, in twice-differentiable functions and problems with no\nconstraints, the optimization consists of finding the points where the gradient\nof the objective function is zero and using the Hessian matrix to classify the\ntype of each point. Sometimes, however it is impossible to compute these\nderivatives and other type of techniques must be employed such as the steepest\ndescent/ascent method and more sophisticated methods such as those based on the\nevolutionary algorithms. Aims. We present a simple algorithm based on the idea\nof genetic algorithms (GA) for optimization. We refer to this algorithm as AGA\n(Asexual Genetic Algorithm) and apply it to two kinds of problems: the\nmaximization of a function where classical methods fail and model fitting in\nastronomy. For the latter case, we minimize the chi-square function to estimate\nthe parameters in two examples: the orbits of exoplanets by taking a set of\nradial velocity data, and the spectral energy distribution (SED) observed\ntowards a YSO (Young Stellar Object). Methods. The algorithm AGA may also be\ncalled genetic, although it differs from standard genetic algorithms in two\nmain aspects: a) the initial population is not encoded, and b) the new\ngenerations are constructed by asexual reproduction. Results. Applying our\nalgorithm in optimizing some complicated functions, we find the global maxima\nwithin a few iterations. For model fitting to the orbits of exoplanets and the\nSED of a YSO, we estimate the parameters and their associated errors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 May 2009 19:14:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-25"}

Doppler shifts of up to 9 km/s are\nobserved at the edges of bright granules, demonstrating that the flows reach\nsupersonic speeds. The strongest velocities occur in patches of 0.5 arcsec or\nless.

Stellar gas falls back to the BH, releasing a flare of\nenergy. In anticipation of upcoming transient surveys, we predict the light\ncurves and spectra of tidal flares as a function of time, highlighting the\nunique signatures of tidal flares in the optical and near-IR. Some of the gas\ninitially bound to the BH is likely blown away when the fallback rate is\nsuper-Eddington at early times. This outflow produces an optical luminosity\ncomparable to that of a supernova; such events have durations of ~10 days and\nmay have been missed in supernova searches that exclude the nuclear regions of\ngalaxies. When the fallback rate subsides below Eddington, the gas accretes\nonto the BH via a thin disk whose emission peaks in the UV to soft X-rays. Some\nof this emission is reprocessed by the unbound stellar debris, producing a\nspectrum of very broad emission lines (with no corresponding narrow forbidden\nlines).

These models match cluster main\nsequences over a wide range of metallicity within the errors of the adopted\ncluster parameters. However, we find a large discrepancy of model colors at the\nlower main sequence (Teff < ~4500 K) for clusters at and above solar\nmetallicity. We also reach similar conclusions using the theoretical isochrones\nof Girardi et al. and Dotter et al., but our new models are generally in better\nagreement with the data. Using our theoretical isochrones, we also derive\nmain-sequence fitting distances and turn-off ages for five key globular\nclusters, and demonstrate the ability to derive these quantities from\nphotometric data in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. In particular, we exploit\nmultiple color indices (g - r, g - i, and g - z) in the parameter estimation,\nwhich allows us to evaluate internal systematic errors. Our distance estimates,\nwith an error of sigma(m - M) = 0.03-0.11 mag for individual clusters, are\nconsistent with Hipparcos-based subdwarf fitting distances derived in the\nJohnson-Cousins or Stromgren photometric systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 May 2009 20:00:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-22"}

Star formation, energy input, and\nnonthermal pressure support are included. To match the gas fractions seen in\nnon-radiative hydrodynamical simulations, roughly 5% of the binding energy of\nthe dark matter must be transferred to the gas during cluster formation; the\npresence of nonthermal pressure support increases this value. In order to match\nX-ray observations, scale-free behavior must be broken. This can be due to\neither variation of the efficiency of star formation with cluster mass M_500,\nor the input of additional energy proportional to the formed stellar mass M_F.\nThese two processes have similar effects on X-ray scalings. If 9% of the gas is\nconverted into stars, independent of cluster mass, then feedback energy input\nof 1.2e-5*M_Fc^2 (or ~1.0 keV per particle) is required to match observed\nclusters. Alternatively, if the stellar mass fraction varies as M_500^-0.26\nthen a lower feedback of 4e-6*M_Fc^2 is needed, and if the stellar fraction\nvaries as steeply as M_500^-0.49 then no additional feedback is necessary. The\nmodel clusters reproduce the observed trends of gas temperature and gas mass\nfraction with cluster mass, as well as observed entropy and pressure profiles;\nthus they provide a calibrated basis with which to interpret upcoming SZ\nsurveys. One consequence of the increased gas energy is that the baryon\nfraction inside the virial radius is less than roughly 90% of the cosmic mean,\neven for the most massive clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 May 2009 20:08:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-22"}

By considering our results and collecting others from\nthe literature, we were able to propose a phenomenological law that considers\nthe systematic dependence of Tc with structural and electronic parameters. This\nlaw predicts fairly well the pressure sensitivity of Tc, its dependence with\nthe A-cation radius disorder and its evolution in the high pressure range.\nConsidering a Double Exchange model, modified by polaronic effects, the\nphenomenological law obtained for Tc can be associated with the product of two\nterms: the polaronic modified bandwidth and an effective hole doping.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 May 2009 21:40:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

We calculate the\nheat capacity for such a quark star, and the results show that the residual\nthermal energy cannot sustain the observed thermal X-ray luminosities seen in\ntypical isolated X-ray pulsars. We conclude that other heating mechanisms must\nbe in operation if the pulsars are in fact solid quark stars. Two possible\nheating mechanisms are explored. Firstly, for pulsars with little\nmagnetospheric activities, accretion from the interstellar medium or from the\nmaterial in the associated supernova remnants may power the observed thermal\nemission. In the propeller regime, a disk-accretion rate ${\\dot M}\\sim$1% of\nthe Eddington rate with an accretion onto the stellar surface at a rate of\n$\\sim 0.1% {\\dot M}$ could explain the observed emission luminosities of the\ndim isolated neutron stars and the central compact objects. Secondly, for\npulsars with significant magnetospheric activities, the pulsar spindown\nluminosities may have been as the sources of the thermal energy via reversing\nplasma current flows. A phenomenological study between pulsar bolometric X-ray\nluminosities and the spin energy loss rates presents the probable existence of\na 1/2-law or a linear law, i.e. $L_{\\rm bol}^{\\infty}\\propto\\dot{E}^{1/2}$ or\n$L_{\\rm bol}^{\\infty}\\propto\\dot{E}$. This result together with the thermal\nproperties of solid quark stars allow us to calculate the thermal evolution of\nsuch stars.

The low flux state is consistent with a\nmodel where a standard accretion disk is truncated at a radius of ~17\nSchwarzschild radius around a ~200 Msun black hole. The inner hot region\nComptonizes photons from the outer disk to give the primary spectral component.\nThe spectrum of the high flux state is not compatible with such a geometry.\nInstead, it is consistent with a model where a hot corona covers a cold\naccretion disk and Comptonizes the disk photons. The variability as a function\nof energy is also shown to be consistent with the corona model.
