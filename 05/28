In particular,\nwe focus on 1) the central black hole to stellar mass ratio of the host galaxy,\n2) the lifetime of the luminous quasar phase, 3) the mass of stars formed in\nthe host galaxy within the last Gyr, and 4) the X-ray luminosity of the hot\ndiffuse gas. As a result, we try to pin down the most successful range of\nmechanical feedback efficiencies. We find that while low feedback efficiencies\nresult in too much growth of the SMBH, high efficiencies totally blow out the\nhot interstellar gas, and the models are characterized by very low thermal\nX-ray luminosity well below the observed range. The net lifetime of the quasar\nphase is strongly coupled to the mass ratio between SMBH and its host galaxy,\nwhile the X-ray luminosity is generally correlated to the recent star formation\nwithin the last Gyr. When considering the popularly adopted model of the\nconstant feedback efficiency, the feedback energy deposited into the ambient\nmedium should be more than 0.01% of the SMBH accretion energy to be consistent\nwith the SMBH mass to stellar mass ratio in the local universe. Yet, the X-ray\nluminosity of the hot gas favors about 0.005% of the accretion energy as the\nmechanical AGN feedback energy. We conclude that the purely mechanical feedback\nmode is unlikely to be simultaneously compatible with all four observable\ntests, even allowing a broad range of feedback efficiencies, and that including\nboth radiative and mechanical feedback together may be a solution to comply the\nobservational constraints.

This can be\nvery light and very weakly coupled, with a mass which is unrelated to its\ncouplings to the gauge fields, described by Wess Zumino interactions.\n  We discuss two independent realizations of these models, one derived from the\ntheory of intersecting branes and the second one obtained by decoupling one\nchiral fermion per generation (one right-handed neutrino) from an anomaly-free\nmother theory.

Also, we investigate the\nimpact of erroneous detection of spectrum holes and thereof missing\ncommunication opportunities on the capacity of the secondary channel.

Theoretical models predict helium fusion to\nproceed as a thermonuclear runaway for accretion rates below the Eddington\nlimit and as stable burning above this limit. Observations, however, place the\nboundary close to 10% of the Eddington limit. We study the effect of\nrotationally induced transport processes on the stability of helium burning.\nFor the first time detailed calculations of thin helium shell burning on\nneutron stars are performed using a hydrodynamic stellar evolution code\nincluding rotation and rotationally induced magnetic fields. We find that in\nmost cases the instabilities from the magnetic field provide the dominant\ncontribution to the chemical mixing, while Eddington-Sweet circulations become\nimportant at high rotation rates. As helium is diffused to greater depths, the\nstability of the burning is increased, such that the critical accretion rate\nfor stable helium burning is found to be lower. Combined with a higher heat\nflux from the crust, as suggested by recent studies, turbulent mixing could\nexplain the observed critical accretion rate. Furthermore, close to this\nboundary we find oscillatory burning, which previous studies have linked to mHz\nQPOs. In models where we continuously lower the heat flux from the crust, the\nperiod of the oscillations increases by up to several tens of percents, similar\nto the observed frequency drift, suggesting that this drift could be caused by\nthe cooling of deeper layers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2009 17:18:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-02"}

Although in theory it is clear that this is possible, the difficulty\nlies in the construction of algorithms that perform the recovery efficiently,\nas well as determining which kind of linear measurements allow for the\nreconstruction. There have been two distinct major approaches to sparse\nrecovery that each present different benefits and shortcomings.

Namely, we present the first self-consistent\nUV-to-radio spectral energy distribution fits of 76 SMGs with spectroscopic\nredshifts using all photometric datapoints from ultraviolet to radio\nsimultaneously.

A regularized N-body code including post-Newtonian\nterms is used to carry out direct integrations of 19 stars in the S-star\ncluster for 10 Myr. The mass of the IMBH is assigned one of four values from\n400 Msun to 4000 Msun, and its initial semi-major axis with respect to the SMBH\nis varied from 0.3-30 mpc, bracketing the radii at which inspiral of the IMBH\nis expected to stall.

Changes at the level of 1% in the orbital elements of the S-stars could\noccur in just a few years if the IMBH is sufficiently massive. On time scales\nof 1 Myr or longer, the IMBH efficiently randomizes the eccentricities and\norbital inclinations of the S-stars. Kozai oscillations are observed when the\nIMBH lies well outside the orbits of the stars. Perturbations from the IMBH can\neject stars from the cluster, producing hypervelocity stars, and can also\nscatter stars into the SMBH; stars with high initial eccentricities are most\nlikely to be affected in both cases. The distribution of S-star orbital\nelements is significantly altered from its currently-observed form by IMBHs\nwith masses greater than 1000 Msun if the IMBH/SMBH semi-major axis lies in the\nrange 3-10 mpc.

First of all, we investigate the outage\nprobability and the outage-based power loss of the MIMO-ISI ARQ channel when\noptimal maximum a posteriori (MAP) turbo packet combining is used at the\nreceiver. We show that the ARQ delay (i.e., the maximum number of ARQ rounds)\ndoes not completely translate into a diversity gain. We then introduce two\nefficient turbo packet combining algorithms that are inspired by minimum mean\nsquare error (MMSE)-based turbo equalization techniques. Both schemes can be\nviewed as low-complexity versions of the optimal MAP turbo combiner. The first\nscheme is called signal-level turbo combining and performs packet combining and\nmultiple transmission ISI cancellation jointly at the signal-level.

This class of objects is\nthought to have relatively small black hole mass and to accrete at high\nEddington ratio. The radio loudness and variability of the compact radio core\nindicates the presence of a relativistic jet. Quasi simultaneous\nradio-optical-X-ray and gamma-ray observations are presented. Both radio and\ngamma-ray emission (observed over 5-months) are strongly variable. The\nsimultaneous optical and X-ray data from Swift show a blue continuum attributed\nto the accretion disk and a hard X-ray spectrum attributed to the jet. The\nresulting broad band spectral energy distribution (SED) and, in particular, the\ngamma-ray spectrum measured by Fermi are similar to those of more powerful\nFSRQ. A comparison of the radio and gamma-ray characteristics of PMN J0948+0022\nwith the other blazars detected by LAT shows that this source has a relatively\nlow radio and gamma-ray power, with respect to other FSRQ.

In this article we further explore\na recently proposed class of quantum field theories, involving noncanonically\ncommuting complex scalar fields, which have been shown to entail a DSR-like\nsymmetry. An open issue for such theories is whether the DSR-like symmetry has\nto be taken as a physically relevant symmetry, or if in fact the \"true\"\nsymmetries of the theory are just rotations and translations while boost\ninvariance has to be considered broken. We analyze here this issue by extending\nthe known results to curved spacetime under both of the previous assumptions.\nWe show that if the symmetry of the free theory is taken to be a DSR-like\nrealization of the Poincar\\'e symmetry, then it is not possible to render such\na symmetry a gauge symmetry of the curved physical spacetime. However, it is\npossible to introduce an auxiliary spacetime which allows to describe the\ntheory as a standard quantum field theory in curved spacetime. Alternatively,\ntaking the point of view that the noncanonical commutation of the fields\nactually implies a breakdown of boost invariance, the physical spacetime\nmanifold has to be foliated in surfaces of simultaneity and the field theory\ncan be coupled to gravity by making use of the ADM prescription.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 May 2009 07:47:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2009 14:21:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

At some point during the collapse, a disk is formed around the\nprotostar and the disk will spin up and grow in size as the core contracts\nbecause of angular momentum conservation. The question is how early the disk\nformation process occurs. In this paper we aim to characterize the kinematical\nstate of a deeply embedded, Class 0 young stellar object, NGC1333-IRAS2A, based\non high angular resolution (< 1$''$ $\\approx$ 200 AU) interferometric\nobservations of HCN and H$^{13}$CN J = 4-3 from the Submillimeter Array, and\ntest whether a circumstellar disk can be detected based on gas kinematic\nfeatures. We adopt a physical model which has been shown to describe the object\nwell and obtain a fit of a parameterized model of the velocity field, using a\ntwo-dimensional axis-symmetric radiation transfer code. The parameterization\nand fit to the high angular resolution data characterize the central dynamical\nmass and the ratio of infall velocity to rotation velocity. We find a large\namount of infall and very little rotation on all scales. The central object has\na relatively low mass of 0.25 M$_\\odot$ . As an object with a low stellar mass\ncompared to the envelope mass, we conclude that NGC1333-IRAS2A is consistent\nwith the suggestion that, as a Class 0 object, it represents the earliest\nstages of star formation. The large amount of infall relative to rotation also\nsuggests that this is a young object. We do however find the need of a central\ncompact component on scales of a few hundred AU based on the continuum data,\nwhich suggests that disk formation happens shortly after the initial\ngravitational collapse. The data do not reveal a distinct velocity field for\nthis 0.1 M$_\\odot$ component.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 May 2009 08:43:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-14"}

In the spirit of a minimalist approach,\nour model includes only the minimum of ingredients necessary to capture the\ngeneric features of this class of compounds as brought to light by experiments.\nWe consider only two kinds of particles: strongly coupled host atoms, which\nform the structural cavities, and guest atoms confined in the cavities. In\nspite of the confinement, for relatively small amplitude vibrations of the\nguest atoms, their interaction with the host particles is assumed to be weaker\nthan between the host atoms. We calculate self-consistently the vibrational\nmode (phonon) line broadenings for the empty and filled (by the guest atoms)\ncavities. We show that the soft phonon dispersion sheet, which appears for\nweakly bonded guest atoms, yields to large mode broadening via three waves\nanharmonic mode coupling. In turn the Umklapp part of this broadening reduces\ndrastically the phonon thermoconductivity coefficient. We conclude that for a\nsystem with a soft mode component in the vibrational spectrum phonon broadening\nis always larger and thermal conductivity is always appreciably smaller than\nfor a system without this soft mode (provided all other characteristics are the\nsame). Although our model is minimal, in the sense of ignoring the complexity\nof actual guest-host structures, when properly interpreted, it can yield quite\nreasonable values for a variety of measurable quantities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 May 2009 10:22:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-29"}

The evolution of the spectra are shown from\nthe initial P-Cygni phase to an emission-line phase and finally to a dust\nformation stage. The characteristics of the JHK spectra are very similar to\nthose observed in a nova outburst occurring on a carbon-oxygen white dwarf. We\nanalyse an observed line at 2.088 micron and suggest it could be due to FeII\nexcited by Lyman alpha fluorescence. The highlight of the observations is the\ndetection of the first overtone bands of carbon monoxide (CO) in the 2.29 -\n2.40 micron region. The CO bands are modeled to estimate the temperature and\nmass of the emitting CO gas and also to place limits on the 12C/13C ratio. The\nCO bands are recorded over several epochs thereby allowing a rare opportunity\nto study its evolution from a phase of constant strength through a stage when\nthe CO is destroyed fairly rapidly.

Mechanical spring structures can cause additional\nnon-linearities via material, geometrical and contact effects.

It automatically links the color of a galaxy with its\nmorphology and does not require gas consumption, removal or termination of gas\nsupply. Given that star formation takes place in gravitationally unstable gas\ndisks, it can be quenched when a disk becomes stable against fragmentation to\nbound clumps. This can result from the growth of a stellar spheroid, for\ninstance by mergers. We present the concept of morphological quenching (MQ)\nusing standard disk instability analysis, and demonstrate its natural\noccurrence in a cosmological simulation using an efficient zoom-in technique.\nWe show that the transition from a stellar disk to a spheroid can be sufficient\nto stabilize the gas disk, quench star formation, and turn an early-type galaxy\nred and dead while gas accretion continues. The turbulence necessary for disk\nstability can be stirred up by sheared perturbations within the disk in the\nabsence of bound star-forming clumps. While gas stripping processes are limited\nto dense groups and clusters, and other quenching mechanisms like AGN feedback,\nvirial shock heating and gravitational heating, are limited to halos more\nmassive than 10^12 Mo, the MQ can explain the appearance of red ellipticals\neven in less massive halos and in the field. The dense gas disks observed in\nsome of today's red ellipticals may be the relics of this mechanism, whereas\nred galaxies with quenched gas disks are expected to be more frequent at high\nredshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 May 2009 15:25:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2009 12:58:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

We find that the quantum\npoint contact not only serves as a detector but also causes a back-action onto\nthe measured device. Electron scattering in the quantum point contact leads to\nemission of microwave radiation. The radiation is found to induce an electronic\ntransition between two quantum dots, similar to the absorption of light in real\natoms and molecules. Using a charge detector to probe the electron transitions,\nwe can relate a single-electron tunneling event to the absorption of a single\nphoton.

In this case, the\nspectrum of the crossed product is homeomorphic, via an induction map, to a\nquotient of the spectrum of the crossed product by the stabilizer group bundle.\nThe main theorem is also generalized in the groupoid algebra case to an\nidentification of the primitive ideal space.

In both cases the identification is topological. We then apply these\ntheorems in a number of examples, and examine when a groupoid algebra has\nHausdorff spectrum.

Spectrum sensing performed by secondary users to detect unoccupied\nspectrum bands, is a key enabling technique for cognitive radio. This paper\nproposes a truncated sequential spectrum sensing scheme, namely the sequential\nshifted chi-square test (SSCT). The SSCT has a simple test statistic and does\nnot rely on any deterministic knowledge about primary signals. As figures of\nmerit, the exact false-alarm probability is derived, and the miss-detection\nprobability as well as the average sample number (ASN) are evaluated by using a\nnumerical integration algorithm. Corroborating numerical examples show that, in\ncomparison with fixed-sample size detection schemes such as energy detection,\nthe SSCT delivers considerable reduction on the ASN while maintaining a\ncomparable detection performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 May 2009 15:47:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-29"}

Basically, we are asking the question\nwhich theorems can be continuously or computably transferred into each other?\nFor this purpose theorems are considered via their realizers which are\noperations with certain input and output data. The technical tool to express\ncontinuous or computable relations between such operations is Weihrauch\nreducibility and the partially ordered degree structure induced by it. We have\nidentified certain choice principles which are cornerstones among Weihrauch\ndegrees and it turns out that certain core theorems in analysis can be\nclassified naturally in this structure. In particular, we study theorems such\nas the Intermediate Value Theorem, the Baire Category Theorem, the Banach\nInverse Mapping Theorem and others. We also explore how existing\nclassifications of the Hahn-Banach Theorem and Weak K\"onig's Lemma fit into\nthis picture. We compare the results of our classification with existing\nclassifications in constructive and reverse mathematics and we claim that in a\ncertain sense our classification is finer and sheds some new light on the\ncomputational content of the respective theorems. We develop a number of\nseparation techniques based on a new parallelization principle, on certain\ninvariance properties of Weihrauch reducibility, on the Low Basis Theorem of\nJockusch and Soare and based on the Baire Category Theorem. Finally, we present\na number of metatheorems that allow to derive upper bounds for the\nclassification of the Weihrauch degree of many theorems and we discuss the\nBrouwer Fixed Point Theorem as an example.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 May 2009 15:50:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2009 12:27:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2009 20:20:32 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 12 Dec 2009 18:00:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-07"}

The electro-magnetic configuration\nforming the RCS incorporates all three components of the magnetic field\n(including the guiding field) and a drifted electric field. PIC simulations\nreveal that there is a polarisation electric field that appears during\nacceleration owing to a separation of electrons from protons towards the\nmidplane of the RCS. If the plasma density is low, the polarisation field is\nweak and the particle trajectories in the PIC simulations are similar to those\nin the test particle (TP) approach. For the higher plasma density the\npolarisation field is stronger and it affects the trajectories of protons by\nincreasing their orbits during acceleration. This field also leads to a less\nasymmetrical abundances of ejected protons towards the midplane in comparison\nwith the TP approach. For a given magnetic topology electrons in PIC\nsimulations are ejected to the same semispace as protons, contrary to the TP\nresults. This happens because the polarisation field extends far beyond the\nthickness of a current sheet. This field decelerates the electrons, which are\ninitially ejected into the semispace opposite to the protons, returns them back\nto the RCS, and, eventually, leads to the electron ejection into the same\nsemispace as protons. Energy distribution of the ejected electrons is rather\nwide and single-peak, contrary to the two-peak narrow-energy distribution\nobtained in the TP approach. In the case of a strong guiding field, the mean\nenergy of the ejected electrons is found to be smaller than it is predicted\nanalytically and by the TP simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 May 2009 15:56:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Such systems, synchronous or not, use clocks and timeouts. Therefore\nthe magnitudes of elapsed absolute time in the system need to satisfy the axiom\nof Archimedes. Under this restriction of asynchronicity logically\ntime-independent solutions can be derived which are nonetheless better (in\nnumber of message passes) than is possible otherwise. The use of clocks by the\nindividual processors, in elections in a ring of asynchronous processors\nwithout central control, allows a deterministic solution which requires but a\nlinear number of message passes. To obtain the result it has to be assumed that\nthe clocks measure finitely proportional absolute time-spans for their time\nunits, that is, the magnitudes of elapsed time in the ring network satisfy the\naxiom of Archimedes. As a result, some basic subtilities associated with\ndistributed computations are highlighted. For instance, the known nonlinear\nlower bound on the required number of message passes is cracked. For the\nsynchronous case, in which the necessary assumptions hold a fortiori, the\nmethod is -asymptotically- the most efficient one yet, and of optimal order of\nmagnitude. The deterministic algorithm is of -asymptotically- optimal bit\ncomplexity, and, in the synchronous case, also yields an optimal method to\ndetermine the ring size.
