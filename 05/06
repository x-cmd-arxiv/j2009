Final states into tau's\nor 4mu give the best fit to the excess. However, in the annihilation scenario,\nthey are incompatible with photon and neutrino constraints, unless DM has a\nquasi-constant density profile. Final states involving electrons are less\nconstrained but poorly fit the excess, unless hidden sector radiation makes\ntheir energy spectrum smoother, allowing a fit to all the data with a\ncombination of leptonic modes. In general, DM lighter than about a TeV cannot\nfit the excesses, so PAMELA should find a greater positron fraction at higher\nenergies. The DM interpretation can be tested by FERMI gamma observations above\n10 GeV: if the electronic excess is everywhere in the DM halo, inverse Compton\nscattering on ambient light produces a well-predicted gamma excess that FERMI\nshould soon detect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 May 2009 19:46:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2010 09:37:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-24"}

The NGC 5044 group hosts many small radio quiet cavities with\na nearly isotropic distribution, cool filaments, a semi-circular cold front and\na two-armed spiral shaped feature of cool gas. A GMRT observation of NGC 5044\nat 610 MHz shows the presence of extended radio emission with a \"torus-shaped\"\nmorphology. The largest X-ray filament appears to thread the radio torus,\nsuggesting that the lower entropy gas within the filament is material being\nuplifted from the center of the group. The radio emission at 235 MHz is much\nmore extended than the emission at 610 MHz, with little overlap between the two\nfrequencies. One component of the 235 MHz emission passes through the largest\nX-ray cavity and is then deflected just behind the cold front. A second\ndetached radio lobe is also detected at 235 MHz beyond the cold front. All of\nthe smaller X-ray cavities in the center of NGC 5044 are undetected in the GMRT\nobservations. Since the smaller bubbles are probably no longer momentum driven\nby the central AGN, their motion will be affected by the group \"weather\" as\nthey buoyantly rise outward.

We used an updated\nversion of the GOODS-MUSIC catalog, extended by the addition of mid-IR fluxes.\nWe compared two different estimators of the Star Formation Rate: the total\ninfrared emission derived from 24um, estimated using both synthetic and\nempirical IR templates, and the multiwavelength fit to the full galaxy SED.

We show that: a) at z>0.3, the SFR is well correlated with\nstellar mass, and this relationship seems to steepen with redshift (using\nIR-based SFRs); b) the contribution to the global SFRD by massive galaxies\nincreases with redshift up to ~2.5, more rapidly than for galaxies of lower\nmass, but appears to flatten at higher z; c) despite this increase, the most\nimportant contributors to the SFRD at any z are galaxies of about, or\nimmediately lower than, the characteristic stellar mass; d) at z~2, massive\ngalaxies are actively star-forming, with a median SFR 300 Msun/yr. During this\nepoch, they assemble a substantial part of their final stellar mass; e) the\nSSFR shows a clear bimodal distribution. The analysis of the SFRD and the SSFR\nseems to support the downsizing scenario, according to which high mass galaxies\nhave formed their stars earlier and faster than their low mass counterparts.

Further, under very strong\ninterference, we show that a joint decoder is DMT-optimal and \"decouples\" the\nfading interference channel, i.e., from a DMT perspective, it is possible to\ntransmit as if the interfering user were not present. In addition, we show\nthat, under very strong interference, decoding interference while treating the\nintended signal as noise, subtracting the result out, and then decoding the\ndesired signal, a process known as \"stripping\", achieves the optimal DMT\nregion. Our proofs are constructive in the sense that code design criteria for\nachieving DMT-optimality (in the cases where we can demonstrate it) are\nprovided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 May 2009 13:29:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-07"}

The sWeights defined for the sPlot technique allow to construct a\nmodified likelihood function using only the signal probability density function\nand events in the signal region.

Here we consider a\nstructure to be tantamount to the noncrossing Watson-Crick and \\pairGU-base\npairings (secondary structure) and additional cross-serial base pairs. These\ninteractions are called pseudoknots and are observed across the whole spectrum\nof RNA functionalities. In the context of studying natural RNA structures,\nsearching for new ribozymes and designing artificial RNA, it is of interest to\nfind RNA sequences folding into a specific structure and to analyze their\ninduced neutral networks. Since the established inverse folding algorithms,\n{\\tt RNAinverse}, {\\tt RNA-SSD} as well as {\\tt INFO-RNA} are limited to RNA\nsecondary structures, we present in this paper the inverse folding algorithm\n{\\tt Inv} which can deal with 3-noncrossing, canonical pseudoknot structures.\n  Results:\n  In this paper we present the inverse folding algorithm {\\tt Inv}.

We formalize an\noptimization problem which aims to minimize energy consumption and\nsimultaneously accounts for other performance metrics such as the data\nreliability and the communication delay. With the help of Karush-Kuhn-Tucker\nconditions (KKT conditions), we derive a simple and explicit, but nevertheless\naccurate, approximate solution under reasonable assumptions. This approximate\nsolution provides theoretical guidelines for designing durable and reliable\nUWSNs. Our result also shows that reliability and communication delay are\ncrucial factors to the energy consumption for transmission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 May 2009 05:42:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-07"}

It is known that any $n$-node static tree can be\nrepresented in $2n + o(n)$ bits and a number of operations on the tree can be\nsupported in constant time under the word-RAM model. However the data\nstructures are complicated and difficult to dynamize. We propose a simple and\nflexible data structure, called the range min-max tree, that reduces the large\nnumber of relevant tree operations considered in the literature to a few\nprimitives that are carried out in constant time on sufficiently small trees.\nThe result is extended to trees of arbitrary size, achieving $2n + O(n\n/\\polylog(n))$ bits of space. The redundancy is significantly lower than any\nprevious proposal. Our data structure builds on the range min-max tree to\nachieve $2n+O(n/\\log n)$ bits of space and $O(\\log n)$ time for all the\noperations. We also propose an improved data structure using $2n+O(n\\log\\log\nn/\\log n)$ bits and improving the time to the optimal $O(\\log n/\\log \\log n)$\nfor most operations. Furthermore, we support sophisticated operations that\nallow attaching and detaching whole subtrees, in time $\\Order(\\log^{1+\\epsilon}\nn / \\log\\log n)$.

One allows\nrepresenting dynamic bitmaps and sequences supporting rank/select and indels,\nwithin zero-order entropy bounds and optimal time $O(\\log n / \\log\\log n)$ for\nall operations on bitmaps and polylog-sized alphabets, and $O(\\log n \\log\n\\sigma / (\\log\\log n)^2)$ on larger alphabet sizes $\\sigma$.

It has been accepted for temperature dependence of losses which changes\nfrom 0 to 3.3*10-4 per one collision of UCN with a trap surface. However, the\nanalysis of raw experimental data shows that in a trap at temperature 10 K\nthere is losses 1.0*10-3 per collision. They are considerably (in 3 times) more\nthan discussed temperature dependence and almost 10 times more than losses due\nto capture cross section on copper.

The transition kinetics is asymptotically\nstretched-exponential when the potential barrier $V_0$ several times exceeds\nthermal energy $k_BT$ ($V_0\\sim 2 - 10 k_BT$) and it cannot be described by the\nnon-Markovian rate theory (NMRT).

Moreover, the rate description is gradually\nrestored when the barrier height exceeds a fuzzy borderline which depends on\nthe power law exponent of free subdiffusion $\\alpha$. Such a potential-free\nsubdiffusion is ergodic. Surprisingly, in periodic potentials it is not\nsensitive to the barrier height in the long time asymptotic limit.

The time-scale of such subdiffusion can exceed\nthe mean residence time in a potential well, or in a finite spatial domain by\nmany orders of magnitude.

With a more elaborate method\nbased on subharmonic solutions [F. Plunian and K.-H. R\\\"adler, Geophys.\nAstrophys.

Most importantly, we find that variable members lie almost entirely\non the convective side of the gap in the cluster sequence between fully\nconvective stars and those which have a radiative core. This result is\nconsistent with a scenario in which the magnetic field changes topology when\nthe star changes from being fully convective, to one containing a radiative\ncore. When the star is convective the magnetic field appears dominated by\nlarge-scale structures, resulting in global-size spots that drive the observed\nvariability. For those stars with radiative cores we observe a marked absence\nof variability due to spots, which suggests a switch to a magnetic field\ndominated by smaller-scale structures, resulting in many smaller spots and thus\nless apparent variability. This implies that wide field variability surveys may\nonly be sensitive to fully convective stars.

Bose\ncondensation does not occur in the thermodynamic limit but this system\npossesses a finite critical temperature, $T_c$, and exhibits a large condensate\nfraction below $T_c$ when the number of shells is finite.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 May 2009 15:04:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2010 14:16:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-19"}

We use SDSS\noptical and GALEX ultraviolet observations of the early-type host galaxies of\n21 nearby SNe Ia and quantify the presence or absence of any young stellar\npopulation to constrain the minimum time delay for each supernova. We find that\nearly-type host galaxies lack `prompt' SNe Ia with time delays of <100 Myr and\nthat ~70% SNe Ia have minimum time delays of 275 Myr -- 1.25 Gyr, with a median\nof 650 Myr, while at least 20% SNe Ia have minimum time delays of at least 1\nGyr at 95% confidence and two of these four SNe Ia are are likely older than 2\nGyr.

While coupling\nuniversally to matter, the brane-bending mode has self-interactions that become\nimportant as soon as the density field becomes non-linear. These\nself-interactions lead to a suppression of the field in high-density\nenvironments, and restore gravity to General Relativity. The code uses a\nmulti-grid relaxation scheme to solve the non-linear field equation in the\nquasi-static approximation. We perform simulations of a flat self-accelerating\nDGP model without cosmological constant. The results of the DGP simulations are\ncompared with standard gravity simulations assuming the same expansion history,\nand with DGP simulations using the linearized equation for the brane bending\nmode. This allows us to isolate the effects of the non-linear self-couplings of\nthe field which are noticeable already on quasi-linear scales.
