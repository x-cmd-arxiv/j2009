The simulated magnetic field\nwithin the Coma cluster is the result of turbulent amplification of the\nmagnetic field during build-up of the cluster. The magnetic seed field\noriginates from star-burst driven, galactic outflows. The synchrotron emission\nis calculated assuming a hadronic model. We follow four approaches with\ndifferent distributions for the cosmic-ray proton (CRp) population within\ngalaxy clusters. The radial profile the radio halo can only be reproduced with\na radially increasing energy fraction within the cosmic ray proton population,\nreaching $>$100% of the thermal energy content at $\\approx$ 1Mpc, e.g. the edge\nof the radio emitting region. Additionally the spectral steepening of the\nobserved radio halo in Coma cannot be reproduced, even when accounting for the\nnegative flux from the thermal SZ effect at high frequencies. Therefore the\nhadronic models are disfavored from present analysis. The emission of\n$\\gamma$-rays expected from our simulated coma is still below the current\nobservational limits (by a factor of $\\sim$6) but would be detectable in the\nnear future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 2009 17:10:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The second of these\noccurs even without detailed balance and is associated with the breaking of\ndiffeomorphism invariance, required for anisotropic scaling in the UV. Since\nthere is a reduced symmetry group there are additional degrees of freedom,\nwhich need not decouple in the infra-red.

The EUV imager/white light coronagraph connection has\nbeen proven so powerful, it is routinely assumed that if no EUV signatures are\npresent when a CME is observed by a coronagraph, then the event must originate\nbehind the visible limb. This assumption carries strong implications for space\nweather forecasting but has not been put to the test. This paper presents the\nfirst detailed analysis of a frontside, large-scale CME that has no obvious\ncounterparts in the low corona. The event was observed by the SECCHI\ninstruments. The COR2A coronagraph observed a slow flux-rope type CME, while an\nextremely faint partial halo was observed in COR2B. The event evolved very\nslowly and is typical of the streamer-blowout CME class. EUVI A 171 images show\na concave feature above the east limb, relatively stable for about two days\nbefore the eruption, when it rises into the coronagraphic fields and develops\ninto the core of the CME. None of the typical low corona signatures of a CME\nwere observed in the EUVI-B images, which we attribute to the unusually large\nheight from which the flux-rope lifted off. This interpretation is supported by\nthe CME mass measurements and estimates of the expected EUV dimming intensity.\nOnly thanks to the availability of the two viewpoints we were able to identify\nthe likely source region. The event originated along a neutral line over the\nquiet sun. No active regions were present anywhere on the visible (from STEREO\nB) face of the disk. Leaving no trace behind on the solar disk, this\nobservation shows unambiguously that a CME eruption does not need to have clear\non-disk signatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 2009 17:04:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-11"}

The\nrealm of conformity is confined within the virialized region associated with\neach galaxy plus dark matter halo system. When a galaxy is located within the\nvirial radius of its nearest neighbor galaxy, its morphology strongly depends\non the neighbor's distance and morphology: the probability for a galaxy to be\nan early type ($f_E$) strongly increases as it approaches an early-type\nneighbor, but tends to decrease as it approaches a late-type neighbor. We find\nthat $f_E$ evolves much faster in high density regions than in low density\nregions, and that the morphology-density relation becomes significantly weaker\nat $z\\approx 1$. This may be because the rate of galaxy-galaxy interactions is\nhigher in high density regions, and a series of interactions and mergers over\nthe course of galaxy life eventually transform late types into early types. We\nfind more isolated galaxies are more luminous, which supports luminosity\ntransformation through mergers at these redshifts. Our results are consistent\nwith those from nearby galaxies, and demonstrate that galaxy-galaxy\ninteractions have been strongly affecting the galaxy evolution over a long\nperiod of time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 2009 17:20:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-22"}

In\ncontrast to previous studies which have only taken charge-dipole interactions\ninto account, like-charged grains are found to coagulate more efficiently than\nneutral grains due to preferential incorporation of small aggregates into\nmid-sized aggregate structures.

Small dust grains are\ntransported both vertically and radially in the disc by turbulent diffusion,\ncounteracting sedimentation to the mid-plane and transporting crystalline\nmaterial from the hot inner disc to the outer parts. The conclusion from recent\nefforts to measure the turbulent diffusion coefficient of magnetorotational\nturbulence is that turbulent diffusion of small particles is much stronger than\nnaively thought. Larger particles -- pebbles, rocks and boulders -- get trapped\nin long-lived high pressure regions that arise spontaneously at large scales in\nthe turbulent flow. These gas high pressures, in geostrophic balance with a\nsub-Keplerian/super-Keplerian zonal flow envelope, are excited by radial\nfluctuations in the Maxwell stress. The coherence time of the Maxwell stress is\nonly a few orbits, where as the correlation time of the pressure bumps is\ncomparable to the turbulent mixing time-scale, many tens or orbits on scales\nmuch greater than one scale height. The particle overdensities contract under\nthe combined gravity of all the particles and condense into gravitationally\nbound clusters of rocks and boulders.

This paper presents an\nextensible parallel library for $N$-body interactions utilizing the FMM\nalgorithm, built on the framework of PETSc. A prominent feature of this library\nis that it is designed to be extensible, with a view to unifying efforts\ninvolving many algorithms based on the same principles as the FMM and enabling\neasy development of scientific application codes. The paper also details an\nexhaustive model for the computation of tree-based $N$-body algorithms in\nparallel, including both work estimates and communications estimates. With this\nmodel, we are able to implement a method to provide automatic, a priori load\nbalancing of the parallel execution, achieving optimal distribution of the\ncomputational work among processors and minimal inter-processor communications.\nUsing a client application that performs the calculation of velocity induced by\n$N$ vortex particles, ample verification and testing of the library was\nperformed. Strong scaling results are presented with close to a million\nparticles in up to 64 processors, including both speedup and parallel\nefficiency. The library is currently able to achieve over 85% parallel\nefficiency for 64 processors.

We also present a non-perturbative solution\nwhich asymptotically approaches an exponential acceleration and discusspossible\ncosmological implications in relation with dark energy. It turns out that the\nequation of state approaches asymptotically $\\omega =-1$ both from above and\nbelow, but the crossing does not occur. It predicts present value of\n$\\omega\\sim -1\\mp 0.07$, which is within the region allowed by the oservational\ndata. This solution also exhibits a power law expansion at early times, and the\nenergy density of the scalar fields mimics that of the stiff matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 May 2009 04:39:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 May 2009 05:15:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2009 13:23:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-19"}

However,\nthere exists an inherent trade off between the gains in terms of probability of\ndetection of the primary user (PU) and the costs in terms of false alarm\nprobability. In this paper, we study the impact of this trade off on the\ntopology and the dynamics of a network of SUs seeking to reduce the\ninterference on the PU through collaborative sensing. Moreover, while existing\nliterature mainly focused on centralized solutions for collaborative sensing,\nwe propose distributed collaboration strategies through game theory. We model\nthe problem as a non-transferable coalitional game, and propose a distributed\nalgorithm for coalition formation through simple merge and split rules. Through\nthe proposed algorithm, SUs can autonomously collaborate and self-organize into\ndisjoint independent coalitions, while maximizing their detection probability\ntaking into account the cooperation costs (in terms of false alarm). We study\nthe stability of the resulting network structure, and show that a maximum\nnumber of SUs per formed coalition exists for the proposed utility model.\nSimulation results show that the proposed algorithm allows a reduction of up to\n86.6% of the average missing probability per SU (probability of missing the\ndetection of the PU) relative to the non-cooperative case, while maintaining a\ncertain false alarm level. In addition, through simulations, we compare the\nperformance of the proposed distributed solution with respect to an optimal\ncentralized solution that minimizes the average missing probability per SU.\nFinally, the results also show how the proposed algorithm autonomously adapts\nthe network topology to environmental changes such as mobility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 May 2009 07:12:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

Considering each dimension as a frequency band, we\ncall this limiting process bandwidth limiting (BL). Assuming that each\ntransmitter maximizes its own data rate by water-filling over the available\nfrequency bands, we consider two scenarios. In the first scenario, transmitters\nuse non-intersecting sets of bands (spectral resource partition), and in the\nsecond one, they freely exploit all the available frequency bands (spectral\nresource sharing). In the latter case, successive interference cancelation\n(SIC) is used. We show the existence of an optimal number of dimensions that a\ntransmitter must use in order to maximize the network performance measured in\nterms of spectral efficiency. We provide a closed form expression for the\noptimal number of accessible bands in the first scenario. Such an optimum\npoint, depends on the number of active transmitters, the number of available\nfrequency bands and the different signal-to-noise ratios. In the second\nscenario, we show that BL does not bring a significant improvement on the\nnetwork spectral efficiency, when all transmitters use the same BL policy. For\nboth scenarios, we provide simulation results to validate our conclusions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 May 2009 11:30:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-19"}
