Yet only for local models can gravity be made parametrically\nweak while keeping the strength of gauge- and Yukawa-couplings fixed--a limit\nwhich is well-motivated by low-energy experiments. Conveniently, the entire\nclass of high-scale effective field theories that can arise from such local\nmodels in F-theory and M-theory can be classified according to simple, purely\ngroup-theoretic rules. In this note, we describe these rules from the viewpoint\nof an effective field theorist with little interest in the underlying geometry\nor high-scale physics, and we discuss the general predictions these models have\nfor low-energy phenomenology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2009 19:57:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-05"}

One is\nfrom those states that are absolutely separable, that is those (which can not\nbe entangled by unitary transformations) for which the maximal concurrence over\nspectral orbits (C_{max}) is zero. The other two contributions are from the\nstates for which C_{max} in [0,1/2], and for which C_{max} in [1/2,1]. We have\npreviously (arXiv:0805.0267) found exact formulas for the absolutely separable\ncontributions in terms of the Hilbert-Schmidt metric over the quantum states,\nand here advance hypotheses as to the exact contributions for C_{max} in\n[1/2,1]. A crucial element in understanding the other two contributions is the\nnature of the ratio (R) of the C_{max}-parameterized separability function for\nthe complex states to the square of the comparable function for the real\nstates--both such functions having clearly displayed jump discontinuities at\nC_{max}=1/2. For C_{max} in [0,1/2], R appears to be of the form 1+ k C_{max},\nexcept near C_{max}=1/2, while for C_{max} in [1/2,1], it seems to be a\nconstant (thus according to the Dyson-index pattern of random matrix theory).\nRelated phenomena also occur for the minimally-degenerate two-qubit states and\nthe qubit-qutrit states. Our results have immediate application to the\ncomputation of separability probabilities in terms of other metrics, such as\nthe Bures (minimal monotone) metric. The paper begins with continuous\nembeddings of the separability probability question in terms of four metrics of\ninterest, using \"generalized Peres-Horodecki conditions\".\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2009 18:31:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2009 18:24:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2009 19:38:26 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2009 19:03:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The possibility that these\nwaves have mixed properties is often ignored. The goal of this work is to study\nand determine the nature of MHD kink waves. This is done by calculating the\nfrequency, the damping rate and the eigenfunctions of MHD kink waves for three\nwidely different MHD waves cases: a compressible pressure-less plasma, an\nincompressible plasma and a compressible plasma with non-zero plasma pressure\nwhich allows for MHD radiation. In all three cases the frequency and the\ndamping rate are for practical purposes the same as they differ at most by\nterms proportional to $(k_z R)^2$. In the magnetic flux tube the kink waves are\nin all three cases, to a high degree of accuracy incompressible waves with\nnegligible pressure perturbations and with mainly horizontal motions. The main\nrestoring force of kink waves in the magnetised flux tube is the magnetic\ntension force. The total pressure gradient force cannot be neglected except\nwhen the frequency of the kink wave is equal or slightly differs from the local\nAlfv\\'{e}n frequency, i.e. in the resonant layer. Kink waves are very robust\nand do not care about the details of the MHD wave environment. The adjective\nfast is not the correct adjective to characterise kink waves. If an adjective\nis to be used it should be Alfv\\'{e}nic. However, it is better to realize that\nkink waves have mixed properties and cannot be put in one single box.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2009 17:03:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Wyner's wiretap channel model recognizes that at\nthe physical layer both the intended receiver and the passive eavesdropper\ninevitably receive an error-prone version of the transmitted message which must\nbe corrected prior to decryption. This paper considers the implications of\nusing both channel and cryptographic codes under the wiretap channel model in a\nway that enhances the \\emph{information-theoretic} security for the friendly\nparties by keeping the information transfer to the eavesdropper small. We\nconsider a secret-key cryptographic system with a linear feedback shift\nregister (LFSR)-based keystream generator and observe the mutual information\nbetween an LFSR-generated sequence and the received noise-corrupted ciphertext\nsequence under a known-plaintext scenario. The effectiveness of a noniterative\nfast correlation attack, which reduces the search time in a brute-force attack,\nis shown to be correlated with this mutual information. For an iterative fast\ncorrelation attack on this cryptographic system, it is shown that an EXIT chart\nand mutual information are very good predictors of decoding success and failure\nby a passive eavesdropper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2009 17:54:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-24"}

But fast cooling requires very high-bandwidth\namplifiers so as to limit the incoherent heating effects from neighboring\nparticles. A method of transit-time optical stochastic cooling has been\nproposed which would employ high-gain, high-bandwidth, solid-state lasers to\namplify the spontaneous radiation from the charged particle bunch in a\nstrong-field magnetic wiggler. This amplified light is then fed back onto the\nsame bunch inside a second wiggler, with appropriate phase delay to effect\ncooling. But before amplification, the usable signal from any one particle is\nquite small, on average much less than one photon per pass, suggesting that the\nradiation should be treated quantum mechanically, and raising doubts as to\nwhether this weak signal even contains sufficient phase information necessary\nfor cooling, and whether it can be reliably amplified to provide the expected\ncooling on each pass. A careful examination of the dynamics, where the\nradiation and amplification processes are treated quantum mechanically,\nindicates that fast cooling is in principle possible, with cooling rates which\nessentially agree with classical calculations, provided that the effects of the\nunavoidable amplifier noise are included. Thus, quantum mechanical\nuncertainties do not present any insurmountable obstacles to optical cooling,\nbut do establish a lower limit on cooling rates and achievable emittances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2009 20:38:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-06"}

At increasing redshift, for example that\nprobed by proposed 21-cm intensity mapping surveys, gravitational lensing\npotentially limits the fidelity (Hui et al., 2007) because it distorts the\napparent matter distribution. In this paper we show that these distortions can\nbe reconstructed, and actually used to map the distribution of intervening dark\nmatter. The lensing information for sources at z=1-3 allows accurate\nreconstruction of the gravitational potential on large scales, l <~ 100, which\nis well matched for Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect measurements of dark\nenergy and its sound speed, and a strong constraint for modified gravity models\nof dark energy.\n  We built an optimal quadratic lensing estimator for non-Gaussian sources,\nwhich is necessary for LSS. The phenomenon of \"information saturation\" (Rimes &\nHamilton, 2005) saturates reconstruction at mildly non-linear scales, where the\nlinear source power spectrum Delta^2 ~ 0.2-0.5. We find that steeper power\nspectra, saturate more quickly. We compute the effective number densities of\nindependent lensing sources for LSS lensing, and find that they increase\nrapidly with redshifts. For LSS/21-cm sources at z ~ 2-4, the lensing\nreconstruction is limited by cosmic variance at l<~ 100.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2009 22:19:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

In a recent paper we showed that ionizing radiation pressure\nonto BLR clouds affects virial BH mass estimates and we provided empirically\ncalibrated corrections. More recently, a new test of the importance of\nradiation forces has been proposed: the MBH-sigma relation has been used to\nestimate MBH for a sample of type-2 AGN and virial relations (with and without\nradiation pressure) for a sample of type-1 AGN extracted from the same parent\npopulation. The observed L/LEdd distribution based on virial BH masses is in\ngood agreement with that based on MBH-sigma only if radiation pressure effects\nare negligible, otherwise significant discrepancies are observed. In this paper\nwe investigate the effects of intrinsic dispersions associated to the virial\nrelations providing MBH, and we show that they explain the discrepancies\nbetween the observed L/LEdd distributions of type-1 and type-2 AGN. These\ndiscrepancies in the L/LEdd distributions are present regardless of the general\nimportance of radiation forces, which must be negligible only for a small\nfraction of sources with large L/LEdd. Average radiation pressure corrections\nshould then be applied in virial MBH estimators until their dependence on\nobserved source physical properties has been fully calibrated. Finally, the\ncomparison between MBH and L/LEdd distributions derived from sigma-based and\nvirial estimators can constrain the variance of BLR physical properties in AGN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 May 2009 07:31:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

However, evolution\nis also governed by fluctuations that can be of greater importance than fitness\ndifferences, and can render evolution effectively neutral. Here, we investigate\nthe effects of selection versus fluctuations in social dilemmas. By studying\nthe mean extinction times of cooperators and defectors, a variable sensitive to\nfluctuations, we are able to identify and quantify an emerging 'edge of neutral\nevolution' that delineates regimes of neutral and Darwinian evolution. Our\nresults reveal that cooperation is significantly maintained in the neutral\nregimes. In contrast, the classical predictions of evolutionary game theory,\nwhere defectors beat cooperators, are recovered in the Darwinian regimes.

When analyzing the\nunderlying dust population in the atmosphere of circumstellar disks, the shape\nof the 10um feature is investigated. We performed interferometric observations\nin N band 8-13um with MIDI using baseline lengths of between 54m and 127m. The\ndata analysis is based on radiative-transfer simulations using the Monte Carlo\ncode MC3D by modeling simultaneously the SED, N band spectra, and\ninterferometric visibilities. Correlated and uncorrelated N band spectra are\ncompared to investigate the radial distribution of the dust composition of the\ndisk atmosphere.

For four objects, the observed N band visibilities and corresponding\nSEDs could be simultaneously simulated using a parameterized active disk-model.\nFor the more evolved objects of our sample, a purely passive disk-model\nprovides the closest fit. The visibilities inferred for one source allow the\npresence of an inner disk gap. For another object, one of two visibility\nmeasurements could not be simulated by our modeling approach. All uncorrelated\nspectra reveal the 10um silicate emission feature. In contrast to this, some\ncorrelated spectra of the observations of the more evolved objects do not show\nthis feature, indicating a lack of small silicates in the inner versus the\nouter regions of these disks.

A usual way to explain why Rossby waves can\nparticipate to the dynamo process goes back to Busse (1975). In his picture,\nthe flow geometry is a cylindrical array of parallel rolls aligned with the\nrotation axis. The axial flow component (the component parallel to the rotation\naxis) is (i) maximum in the middle of each roll and changes its sign from one\nroll to the next. It is produced by the Ekman pumping at the fluid containing\nshell boundary. The corresponding dynamo mechanism can be explained in terms of\nan $\\alpha$-tensor with non-zero coefficients on the diagonal. In rapidly\nrotating objects like the Earth's core (or in a fast rotating experiment),\nRossby waves occur in the limit of small Ekman number ($\\approx 10^{-15}$). In\nthat case, the main source of the axial flow component is not the Ekman pumping\nbut rather the ``geometrical slope effect'' due to the spherical shape of the\nfluid containing shell. This implies that the axial flow component is (ii)\nmaximum at the borders of the rolls and not at the centers. If assumed to be\nstationary, such rolls would lead to zero coefficients on the diagonal of the\n$\\alpha$-tensor, making the dynamo probably less efficient if possible at all.\nActually, the rolls are drifting as a wave, and we show that this drift implies\nnon--zero coefficients on the diagonal of the $\\alpha$-tensor. These new\ncoefficients are in essence very different from the ones obtained in case (i)\nand cannot be interpreted in terms of the heuristic picture of Busse (1975).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 May 2009 10:11:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The soft and hard band Power-Spectral\nDensities (PSDs) of these sources demonstrate variability over a wide range of\ntime-scales. However, on time-scales of tens of seconds, corresponding to the\nputative low-frequency Lorentzian in the PSD, there is additional power in the\nsoft band. To interpret this behaviour, we introduce a new spectral analysis\ntechnique, the `covariance spectrum', to disentangle the contribution of the\nX-ray spectral components to variations on different time-scales. We use this\ntechnique to show that the disc blackbody component varies on all time-scales,\nbut varies more, relative to the power-law, on longer time-scales. This\nbehaviour explains the additional long-term variability seen in the soft band.\nComparison of the blackbody and iron line normalisations seen in the covariance\nspectra in GX 339-4 implies that the short-term blackbody variations are driven\nby thermal reprocessing of the power-law continuum absorbed by the disc.\nHowever, since the amplitude of variable reflection is the same on long and\nshort time-scales, we rule out reprocessing as the cause of the enhanced disc\nvariability on long time-scales. Therefore we conclude that the long-time-scale\nblackbody variations are caused by instabilities in the disc itself, in\ncontrast to the stable discs seen in BHXRB soft states. Our results provide the\nfirst observational evidence that the low-frequency Lorentzian feature present\nin the PSD is produced by the accretion disc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 May 2009 12:06:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The dip spectrum is well-fitted by the progressive\ncovering model in which the extended ADC is progressively overlapped by the\nabsorbing bulge of low ionization state in the outer accretion disk and that\ndipping is basically due to photoelectric absorption in the bulge. An\nenergy-independent decrease of flux at high energies (20 - 70 keV) is shown to\nbe consistent with the level of Thomson scattering expected in the bulge. An\nabsorption feature at 6.67 keV (Fe XXV) is detected in the non-dip spectrum and\nother possible weak features. In dipping, absorption lines of medium and highly\nionized states are seen suggestive of absorption in the ADC but there is no\nevidence that the lines are stronger than in non-dip.

An engineering-relevant\nproblem is to characterize the SNR value at which this sensitivity starts to\nmatter.\n  In this paper, we consider the general class of continuous-time\nRayleigh-fading channels that satisfy the wide-sense stationary\nuncorrelated-scattering (WSSUS) assumption and are, in addition, underspread.\nFor this class of channels, we show that the noncoherent capacity is close to\nthe AWGN capacity for all SNR values of practical interest, independently of\nwhether the scattering function is compactly supported or not. As a byproduct\nof our analysis, we obtain an information-theoretic pulse-design criterion for\northogonal frequency-division multiplexing systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 May 2009 14:58:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

Many different and incompatible attempts to define\na coherent Everettian quantum theory have been made over the past fifty years.\nHowever, no known version of the theory (unadorned by extra ad hoc postulates)\ncan account for the appearance of probabilities and explain why the theory it\nwas meant to replace, Copenhagen quantum theory, appears to be confirmed, or\nmore generally why our evolutionary history appears to be Born-rule typical.\nThis article reviews some ingenious and interesting recent attempts in this\ndirection by Wallace, Greaves, Myrvold and others, and explains why they don't\nwork. An account of one-world randomness, which appears scientifically\nsatisfactory, and has no many-worlds analogue, is proposed. A fundamental\nobstacle to confirming many-worlds theories is illustrated by considering some\ntoy many-worlds models. These models show that branch weights can exist without\nhaving any role in either rational decision-making or theory confirmation, and\nalso that the latter two roles are logically separate. Wallace's proposed\ndecision theoretic axioms for rational agents in a multiverse and claimed\nderivation of the Born rule are examined. It is argued that Wallace's strategy\nof axiomatizing a mathematically precise decision theory within a fuzzy\nEverettian quasiclassical ontology is incoherent. Moreover, Wallace's axioms\nare not constitutive of rationality either in Everettian quantum theory or in\ntheories in which branchings and branch weights are precisely defined. In both\ncases, there exist coherent rational strategies that violate some of the\naxioms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 May 2009 15:20:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Aug 2010 21:10:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 4 Jul 2013 20:21:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-08"}

Furthermore, a large-scale geological depression, located on one of\nthe components, was introduced to better match the observed lightcurves. This\nvast geological feature of about 68 km in diameter, which could be postulated\nas a bowl-shaped impact crater, is indeed responsible of the photometric\nasymmetries seen on the \"shoulders\" of the lightcurves. The bulk density was\nthen recomputed to 1.28+/-0.04 gcm-3 to take into account this large-scale\nnon-convexity. This giant crater could be the aftermath of a tremendous\ncollision of a 100-km sized proto-Antiope with another Themis family member.\nThis statement is supported by the fact that Antiope is sufficiently porous\n(~50%) to survive such an impact without being wholly destroyed.

We calculated that the impactor must\nhave a diameter greater than ~17 km, for an impact velocity ranging between 1\nand 4 km/s.
