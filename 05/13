In the simplest scenario, the rotation will be uniform across the sky,\nbut the rotation angle may also vary across the sky. We develop in detail the\ncomplete set of full-sky quadratic estimators for the rotation of the CMB\npolarization that can be constructed from the CMB temperature and polarization.\nWe derive the variance with which these estimators can be measured and show\nthat these variances reduce to the simpler flat-sky expressions in the\nappropriate limit.

Why some viruses establish\nchronic infections while other do not is poorly understood. One possibility is\nthat the host's immune response is impaired during chronic infections and is\nunable to clear the virus from the host. In this report we use a recently\nproposed framework to estimate the per capita killing efficacy of CD8$^+$ T\ncells, specific for the MT389 epitope of polyoma virus (PyV), which establishes\na chronic infection in mice. Surprisingly, the estimated per cell killing\nefficacy of MT389-specific effector CD8$^+$ T cells during the acute phase of\nthe infection was very similar to the previously estimated efficacy of effector\nCD8$^+$ T cells specific to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus\n(LCMV-Armstrong), which is cleared from the host. We also find that during the\nchronic phase of the infection the killing efficacy of PyV-specific CD8$^+$ T\ncells was only half of that of cells in the acute phase. This decrease in the\nkilling efficacy is again surprisingly similar to the change in the killing\nefficacy of LCMV-specific CD8$^+$ T cells from the peak of the response to the\nmemory phase. Interestingly, we also find that PyV-specific CD8$^+$ T cells in\nthe chronic phase of the infection require lower doses of antigen to kill a\ntarget cell. In summary, we find little support for the hypothesis that\npersistence of infections is caused by inability of the host to mount an\nefficient immune response, and that even in the presence of an efficient\nCD8$^+$ T cell response, some viruses can still establish a persistent\ninfection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 May 2009 17:34:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-13"}

In\nthis mechanism, nodes are added sequentially and attached to existing nodes at\na rate that is strictly proportional to the degree. We classify nodes by their\ndepth n, defined as the distance from the root of the tree, and find that the\nnetwork is strongly stratified. Most notably, the distribution f_k^(n) of nodes\nwith degree k at depth n has a power-law tail, f_k^(n) ~ k^{-\\gamma(n)}. The\nexponent grows linearly with depth, gamma(n)=2+(n-1)/<n-1>, where the brackets\ndenote an average over all nodes. Therefore, nodes that are closer to the root\nare better connected, and moreover, the degree distribution strongly varies\nwith depth. Similarly, the in-component size distribution has a power-law tail\nand the characteristic exponent grows linearly with depth. Qualitatively, these\nbehaviors extend to a class of networks that grow by a redirection mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 May 2009 17:46:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-04"}

By utilizing measurements of the redshift evolution of the\nmass-metallicity (M-Z) relationship for galaxies, along with a sharp host\nmetallicity cut-off suggested by Modjaz and collaborators, we estimate an upper\nlimit on the stellar mass of a galaxy that can efficiently produce a GRB as a\nfunction of redshift. By employing consistent abundance indicators, we find\nthat sub-solar metallicity cut-offs effectively limit GRBs to low stellar mass\nspirals and dwarf galaxies at low redshift. At higher redshifts, as the average\nmetallicity of galaxies in the Universe falls, the mass range of galaxies\ncapable of hosting a GRB broadens, with an upper bound approaching the mass of\neven the largest spiral galaxies. We compare these predicted limits to the\ngrowing number of published GRB host masses and find that extremely low\nmetallicity cut-offs of 0.1 to 0.5 solar are effectively ruled out by a large\nnumber of intermediate mass galaxies at low redshift. A mass function that\nincludes a smooth decrease in the efficiency of producing GRBs in galaxies of\nmetallicity above 12+log(O/H)_(KK04) ~ 8.7 can, however, accommodate a majority\nof the measured host galaxy masses.

We propose that the ULIRG lifecycle consists of three phases. The\nfirst phase lasts from the initial encounter until approximately coalescence.\nIt is characterized by homogeneous mid-IR spectral shapes, and IR emission\nmainly from star formation, with a contribution from an AGN in some cases. At\nthe end of this phase, a ULIRG enters one of two evolutionary paths depending\non the dynamics of the merger, the available quantities of gas, and the masses\nof the black holes in the progenitors. On one branch, the contributions from\nthe starburst and the AGN to the total IR luminosity decline and increase\nrespectively. The IR spectral shapes are heterogeneous, likely due to feedback\nfrom AGN-driven winds. Some objects go through a brief QSO phase at the end. On\nthe other branch, the decline of the starburst relative to the AGN is less\npronounced, and few or no objects go through a QSO phase. We show that the 11.2\nmicron PAH feature is a remarkably good diagnostic of evolutionary phase, and\nidentify six ULIRGs that may be archetypes of key stages in this lifecycle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 May 2009 20:13:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-22"}

When larger than the criteria, we find the launch of the\nMHD jets in the following two ways. For models with stronger initial magnetic\nfields, the magnetic pressure amplified inside the accretion disk can drive the\nMHD outflows, which makes the strong magnetic explosions like a 'magnetic\ntower' (type II). For the models with weaker initial magnetic fields, the\nmagnetic tower stalls first and the subsequent MHD outflows are produced by\nsome eventual inflows of the accreting material from the equator to the polar\nregions (type I). Regardless of type I or II, the jets can attain only mildly\nrelativistic speeds with the explosion energy less than $10^{49} \\erg$, which\ncould possibly be related to the X-ray flashes.

The\npulsar appears to show a periodic null-burst cycle with an upper limit to\nnulling fraction, of about 90 percent. The pulsed flux density declines by a\nfactor 94 during the nulled pulses in this pulsar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 May 2009 10:07:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-14"}

In the long time limit a bigger steady transmission\ncoefficient is obtained which means less barrier recrossing than the\none-dimensional case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 May 2009 11:45:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

In the presence of a\nlow-rate feedback link from the destination to each relay stage and the source,\nthis paper proposes an end-to-end antenna selection (EEAS) strategy as an\nalternative to distributed space-time codes. The EEAS strategy uses a subset of\nantennas of each relay stage for transmission of the source signal to the\ndestination with amplify and forwarding at each relay stage. The subsets are\nchosen such that they maximize the end-to-end mutual information at the\ndestination.

A\nmethod comprising numerical simulations of water movement in soil and\nforward-inverse modeling of ERT surveys for two synthetic data sets is\npresented. Resistivity contrast, e.g. by changing water content, is shown to\nhave large influence on the resistivity quantification.\n  An ensemble and clustering approach is introduced in which ensembles of 50\ndifferent inversion models for one data set are created by randomly varying the\nparameters for a regularisation based inversion routine. The ensemble members\nare sorted into five clusters of similar models and the mean model for each\ncluster is computed.

Expansion\nvariables (E-variables) were invented at the end of the 1990s to simplify and\nhelp mechanise expansion. Recently, E-variables have been further simplified\nand generalised to also allow calculating type operators other than just\nintersection. There has been much work on denotational semantics for type\nsystems with intersection types, but none whatsoever before now on type systems\nwith E-variables. Building a semantics for E-variables turns out to be\nchallenging. To simplify the problem, we consider only E-variables, and not the\ncorresponding operation of expansion. We develop a realisability semantics\nwhere each use of an E-variable in a type corresponds to an independent degree\nat which evaluation occurs in the $\\lambda$-term that is assigned the type. In\nthe $\\lambda$-term being evaluated, the only interaction possible between\nportions at different degrees is that higher degree portions can be passed\naround but never applied to lower degree portions. We apply this semantics to\ntwo intersection type systems. We show these systems are sound, that\ncompleteness does not hold for the first system, and completeness holds for the\nsecond system when only one E-variable is allowed (although it can be used many\ntimes and nested). As far as we know, this is the first study of a denotational\nsemantics of intersection type systems with E-variables (using realisability or\nany other approach).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 May 2009 14:10:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-14"}

In such a scheme, objects are represented as a set of\nspatially distributed local features, or parts, arranged in stereotypical\nfashion. To encode the local appearance and to represent the relations between\nthe constituent parts, there has to be an appropriate memory structure formed\nby previous experience with visual objects. Here, we propose a model how a\nhierarchical memory structure supporting efficient storage and rapid recall of\nparts-based representations can be established by an experience-driven process\nof self-organization. The process is based on the collaboration of slow\nbidirectional synaptic plasticity and homeostatic unit activity regulation,\nboth running at the top of fast activity dynamics with winner-take-all\ncharacter modulated by an oscillatory rhythm. These neural mechanisms lay down\nthe basis for cooperation and competition between the distributed units and\ntheir synaptic connections. Choosing human face recognition as a test task, we\nshow that, under the condition of open-ended, unsupervised incremental\nlearning, the system is able to form memory traces for individual faces in a\nparts-based fashion. On a lower memory layer the synaptic structure is\ndeveloped to represent local facial features and their interrelations, while\nthe identities of different persons are captured explicitly on a higher layer.\nAn additional property of the resulting representations is the sparseness of\nboth the activity during the recall and the synaptic patterns comprising the\nmemory traces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 May 2009 14:23:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2009 12:58:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 2010 15:38:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}
