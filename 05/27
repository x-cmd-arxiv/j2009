This technique\nprovides a powerful measure of particular extinction features such as the UV\nbump at 2175\\A, which has been observed in environments ranging from the Milky\nWay to high-redshift star-forming galaxies. Knowledge of the typical strength\nof the UV bump as a function of environment and redshift is crucial for\nconverting restframe UV flux into star formation rates. The UV bump will impart\na unique signature as it moves through various filters due to redshifting; its\npresence can therefore be disentangled from other stellar population effects.\nThe utility of this technique is demonstrated with a large sample of galaxies\ndrawn from the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey. The observed B-R color of\nstar-forming galaxies at 0.6<z<1.4 disfavors the presence of a UV bump as\nstrong as observed in the Milky Way, and instead favors restframe UV\n(1800A<lambda<3000A) attenuation curves similar to the Milky Way without a UV\nbump or a power-law with index delta=-0.7. Stronger constraints on the strength\nof the UV bump in galaxies can be achieved if independent constraints on the\nV-band optical depth are available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 May 2009 16:00:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2009 18:37:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2009 14:53:11 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2009 19:28:38 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 30 Dec 2009 15:16:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

(2) We show that essentially any odd weight two representation is\npotentially modular, following the ideas of Taylor. (3) We show that one can\nlift essentially any odd residual representation to a minimally ramified weight\ntwo p-adic representation, using some ideas of Khare-Wintenberger. As an\napplication of these results we show that if rho is a sufficiently irreducible\nodd weight two p-adic representation of a totally real field F and either F has\nodd degree or rho is indecomposable at some finite place away from p then rho\noccurs as the Tate module of a GL_2-type abelian variety. This establishes some\nnew cases of the Fontaine-Mazur conjecture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 May 2009 18:40:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-27"}

All of the sources were selected to have 1) fnu(24\nmicron) > 0.5 mJy; 2) R-[24] > 14 Vega mag; and 3) a prominent rest-frame 1.6\nmicron stellar photospheric feature redshifted into Spitzer's 3-8 micron IRAC\nbands.

In the first method we focus on the `standard ruler' provided by the\nbaryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) length scale. In the second method we utilize\nadditional information encoded in the galaxy power spectrum including galaxy\nbias from velocity-space distortions and the growth of cosmic structure. We\nfind that a radio synthesis array with about 10 per cent of the collecting area\nof the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), equipped with a wide ($10-100 ~ {\\rm\ndeg}^2$) field-of-view, would have the capacity to perform a $20{,}000 ~ {\\rm\ndeg}^2$ redshift survey to a maximum redshift $z_{\\rm max} \\sim 0.8$ and\nthereby produce dark energy measurements that are competitive with surveys\nlikely to be undertaken by optical telescopes around 2015. There would then be\npowerful arguments for adding collecting area to such a `Phase-1' SKA because\nof the square-law scaling of survey speed with telescope sensitivity for HI\nsurveys, compared to the linear scaling for optical redshift surveys. The full\nSKA telescope should, by performing a $20{,}000 ~ {\\rm deg}^2$ HI redshift\nsurvey to $z_{\\rm max} \\sim 2$ around 2020, yield an accurate measurement of\ncosmological parameters independent of CMB datasets. Combining CMB ({\\sl\nPlanck}) and galaxy power spectrum (SKA) measurements will drive errors in the\ndark energy equation-of-state parameter $w$ well below the 1 per cent level.\nThe major systematic uncertainty in these forecasts is the lack of direct\ninformation about the mass function of high-redshift HI-emitting galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2009 01:24:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2009 14:17:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Using an isospin- and momentum-dependent modified Gogny (MDI)\ninteraction and the SHF approach with 63 popular Skyrme interactions, we have\nsystematically studied the isospin dependence of the saturation properties of\nasymmetric nuclear matter, particularly the incompressibility $K_{sat}(\\delta\n)=K_{0}+K_{sat,2}\\delta ^{2}+K_{sat,4}\\delta ^{4}+O(\\delta ^{6})$ at the\nsaturation density. Our results show that the magnitude of the high-order\n$K_{sat,4}$ parameter is generally small compared to that of the $K_{\\sat,2}$\nparameter. The latter essentially characterizes the isospin dependence of the\nincompressibility at the saturation density and can be expressed as\n$K_{sat,2}=K_{sym}-6L-\\frac{J_{0}}{K_{0}}L$, Furthermore, we have constructed a\nphenomenological modified Skyrme-like (MSL) model which can reasonably describe\nthe general properties of symmetric nuclear matter and the symmetry energy\npredicted by both the MDI model and the SHF approach. The results indicate that\nthe high-order $J_{0}$ contribution to $K_{sat,2}$ generally cannot be\nneglected.

While\nthis problem has for a long time been attributed to the non-analyticity of the\nCompton amplitude with respect to the photon virtuality, I demonstrate that it\nis merely due to an ill-defined low energy limit for VCS, on one hand, and to a\nparticular way of constructing the VCS amplitude, use in the literature, on the\nother. I provide a uniform description of low energy Compton scattering with\nreal and virtual photons by defining a Lorentz-covariant operator sub-basis for\nCompton scattering in that regime, that has six independent structures.\nCorrespondingly, six new generalized polarizabilities are introduced in the\nBreit frame. These polarizabilities are defined as continuous functions of the\nphoton virtuality and at the real photon point match onto the nucleon\npolarizabilities known from real Compton scattering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2009 04:27:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2009 17:13:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-06"}

Previous theoretical\ninvestigations have shown that, in the absence of delay terms and in a regime\nwhere diffusion can be neglected (large P\\'eclet number), the emergent spatial\nstructures are filamental and characterized by a single scaling regime with a\nH\\\"older exponent that depends on the rate of convergence of the reactive\nprocesses and the strength of the stirring measured by the average stretching\nrate. In the presence of delay terms, we show that for sufficiently small\nscales all interacting fields should share the same spatial structure, as found\nin the absence of delay terms. Depending on the strength of the stirring and\nthe magnitude of the delay time, two further scaling regimes that are unique to\nthe delay system may appear at intermediate length scales. An expression for\nthe transition length scale dividing small-scale and intermediate-scale regimes\nis obtained and the scaling behavior of the scalar field is explained. The\ntheoretical results are illustrated by numerical calculations for two types of\nreaction models, both based on delay differential equations, coupled to a\ntwo-dimensional chaotic advection flow. The first corresponds to a single\nreactive scalar and the second to a nonlinear biological model that includes\nnutrients, phytoplankton and zooplankton.

The loop length,\nvelocity gradient along the loops and large velocity dispersions at their foot\npoints are consistent with the NANTEN observations. We also show that the loops\nbecome top-heavy when the curvature of the loop is sufficiently small, so that\nthe rising loop accumulates the overlying gas faster than sliding it down along\nthe loop.

In addition, both the dynamic, field dependent\nresponse and hard electron-ion collisions, are consistently incorporated. The\nlatter were treated in an average manner as a stopping power that in turn was\ncast into a form of a friction force. Here, for the first time a link between\nthe stopping power and the problem of collisional laser absorption is drawn.\nThis allows the theories developed for the stopping power calculation, such as\nthe quantum T-matrix approach, to be applied to the problem of collisional\nlaser absorption. The new approach accommodates the low- and high-frequency\nlimits explained in the text and is valid for arbitrary laser field\nintensities. A comparison with classical MD simulation is indicative of the\nvalidity of the new method in the wide parameter range tested.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2009 10:52:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-28"}

As an application, we derive the quenched asymptotics for the\nBrownian motion in traps distributed according to a random perturbation of the\nlattice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2009 14:30:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-17"}

In type 2 AGN the bolometric\nluminosity (L_b) is generally inferred from the [OIII] emission line luminosity\n(L_OIII). The key issue, in order to estimate the bolometric luminosity in\nthese AGN, is therefore to know the bolometric correction to be applied to\nL_OIII. A complication arises from the fact that the observed L_OIII is\naffected by extinction, likely due to dust within the narrow line region. The\nextinction-corrected [OIII] luminosity (L^c_OIII) is a better estimator of the\nnuclear luminosity than L_OIII. However, so far only the bolometric correction\nto be applied to the uncorrected L_OIII has been evaluated. This paper is\ndevoted to estimate the bolometric correction C_OIII=L_b/L^c_OIII in order to\nderive the Eddington ratios for the type 2 AGN in a sample of SDSS objects. We\nhave collected from the literature 61 sources with reliable estimate of both\nL^c_OIII and X-ray luminosities (L_X). To estimate C_OIII, we combined the\nobserved correlation between L^c_OIII and L_X with the X-ray bolometric\ncorrection. We found, contrary to previous studies, a linear correlation\nbetween L^c_OIII and L_X. We estimated C_OIII using the luminosity-dependent\nX-ray bolometric correction of Marconi et al. (2004), and we found a mean value\nof C_OIII in the luminosity ranges log L_OIII=38-40, 40-42, and 42-44 of 87,\n142 and 454 respectively. We used it to calculate the Eddington ratio\ndistribution of type 2 SDSS AGN at 0.3<z<0.4 and we found that these sources\nare not accreting near their Eddington limit, contrary to previous claims.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2009 15:11:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The classification of these irreducible elements\nprovides the groundwork for inductive arguments that are used to prove\nfaithfulness. The classification of the weak star irreducible elements of type\n$B$ also verifies C.K. Fan's unproved claim about about the set of fully\ncommutative elements in a Coxeter group of type $B$ having no generator\nappearing in the left or right descent set that can be left or right cancelled,\nrespectively. The results of this thesis will be used to construct a trace on\nthe Hecke algebra of type affine $C$, which will then be used to compute\nleading coefficients of certain Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials in a non-recursive\nway.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2009 15:44:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-28"}

The simplest\nscenario implies the development of fast instabilities on the RGB, where Li is\nproduced. When the fields increase in strength, buoyancy slows down and Li is\ndestroyed. 3He is consumed, at variable rates. The process continues on the\nAGB, where however moderate mass circulation rates have little effect on Li due\nto the short time available. O-rich and C-rich stars show different histories\nof Li production/destruction, possibly indicative of different masses.

In this\nfirst paper we characterize the various forms of variability detected and\ndistinguish several separate groups. For each star in our sample, we obtained\n4-5 high-resolution spectra with a signal-to-noise ratio ~100. Our ultimate\ngoal is to identify new candidates presenting variability that potentially\ncomes from Co-rotating Interaction Regions (CIR).\n  Out of a sample of 25 stars, 10 were found to display large-scale changes of\nwhich 4 are of CIR-type (WR1, WR115, WR120 and WR134). The star WR134 was\nalready known to show such changes from previous studies. Three WN8 stars\npresent a different type of large-scale variability and we believe deserve a\ngroup of their own. Also, all three WC9d stars in our sample present\nlarge-scale variability, but it remains to be checked if these are binaries, as\nmany dust-making WR stars are double. Finally, of the remaining stars, 10 were\nfound to show small-amplitude spectral changes which we attribute to normal\nline-profile variability due to inhomogeneities in the wind, and 5 were found\nto show no spectral variability, as far as can be concluded from the data in\nhand.\n  Follow-up studies are required to identify potential periods for our\ncandidates showing CIR-type changes and eventually estimate a rotation rate for\nthese WR stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2009 15:51:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}
