Traditionally, the most widely\nused schemes for 3D structure determination of an object are implemented by\nacquiring multiple measurements over various sample orientations, as in the\ncase of crystallography and tomography (1,2), or by scanning a series of thin\nsections through the sample, as in confocal microscopy (3). Here we present a\n3D imaging modality, termed ankylography (derived from the Greek words ankylos\nmeaning 'curved' and graphein meaning 'writing'), which enables complete 3D\nstructure determination from a single exposure using a monochromatic incident\nbeam. We demonstrate that when the diffraction pattern of a finite object is\nsampled at a sufficiently fine scale on the Ewald sphere, the 3D structure of\nthe object is determined by the 2D spherical pattern. We confirm the\ntheoretical analysis by performing 3D numerical reconstructions of a sodium\nsilicate glass structure at 2 Angstrom resolution and a single poliovirus at 2\n- 3 nm resolution from 2D spherical diffraction patterns alone. Using\ndiffraction data from a soft X-ray laser, we demonstrate that ankylography is\nexperimentally feasible by obtaining a 3D image of a test object from a single\n2D diffraction pattern. This approach of obtaining complete 3D structure\ninformation from a single view is anticipated to find broad applications in the\nphysical and life sciences. As X-ray free electron lasers (X-FEL) and other\ncoherent X-ray sources are under rapid development worldwide, ankylography\npotentially opens a door to determining the 3D structure of a biological\nspecimen in a single pulse and allowing for time-resolved 3D structure\ndetermination of disordered materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 May 2009 17:37:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2009 18:59:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2009 19:07:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-24"}

However, given the spread\nstill existing in the observational data no model can be firmly excluded on the\nbasis of only the [O/Fe] ratios. On the other hand, when the predictions of the\ndifferent models are compared with the G-dwarf metallicity distribution, the\nscenarios with very few prompt Type Ia supernovae can be excluded.

A fraction of prompt Type Ia supernovae larger than 30%\nworsens the agreement with observations and the same occurs if no prompt Type\nIa supernovae are allowed.

Using the correlated band\ntheory method (LDA+ Hubbard U) as seems to be justified by the unusual behavior\nobserved in SrCrO$_3$, above the critical value $U_c$=4 eV only the distorted\nphase undergoes an orbital-ordering transition, resulting in $t_{2g}^2 -->\nd_{xy}^1$($d_{xz}d_{yz}$)$^1$ corresponding to the filling of the $d_{xy}$\norbital but leaving the other two degenerate.

From\nthe measured average FRET efficiency, <E>, the distance distribution P(R) is\ninferred by assuming that the DSE can be described as a polymer. The single\nparameter in the appropriate polymer model (Gaussian chain, Wormlike chain, or\nSelf-avoiding walk) for P(R) is determined by equating the calculated and\nmeasured <E>. In order to assess the accuracy of this \"standard procedure,\" we\nconsider the generalized Rouse model (GRM), whose properties [<E> and P(R)] can\nbe analytically computed, and the Molecular Transfer Model for protein L for\nwhich accurate simulations can be carried out as a function of guanadinium\nhydrochloride (GdmCl) concentration. Using the precisely computed <E> for the\nGRM and protein L, we infer P(R) using the standard procedure. We find that the\nmean end-to-end distance can be accurately inferred (less than 10% relative\nerror) using <E> and polymer models for P(R). However, the value extracted for\nthe radius of gyration (Rg) and the persistence length (lp) are less accurate.\nThe relative error in the inferred R-g and lp, with respect to the exact\nvalues, can be as large as 25% at the highest GdmCl concentration. We propose a\nself-consistency test, requiring measurements of <E> by attaching dyes to\ndifferent residues in the protein, to assess the validity of describing DSE\nusing the Gaussian model. Application of the self-consistency test to the GRM\nshows that even for this simple model the Gaussian P(R) is inadequate. Analysis\nof experimental data of FRET efficiencies for the cold shock protein shows that\nat there are significant deviations in the DSE P(R) from the Gaussian model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2009 14:05:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-05"}

To fully utilize its potential, one\nhas to be able to control systematic effects down to below the level of the\nstatistical parameter errors. Particularly worrisome in this respect is\nintrinsic alignment, causing considerable parameter biases via correlations\nbetween the intrinsic ellipticities of galaxies and the gravitational shear,\nwhich mimic lensing. In an earlier work we have proposed a nulling technique\nthat downweights this systematic, only making use of its well-known redshift\ndependence. We assess the practicability of nulling, given realistic conditions\non photometric redshift information. For several simplified intrinsic alignment\nmodels and a wide range of photometric redshift characteristics we calculate an\naverage bias before and after nulling. Modifications of the technique are\nintroduced to optimize the bias removal and minimize the information loss by\nnulling. We demonstrate that one of the presented versions is close to optimal\nin terms of bias removal, given high quality of photometric redshifts. For\nexcellent photometric redshift information, i.e. at least 10 bins with a small\ndispersion, a negligible fraction of catastrophic outliers, and precise\nknowledge about the redshift distributions, one version of nulling is capable\nof reducing the shear-intrinsic ellipticity contamination by at least a factor\nof 100. Alternatively, we describe a robust nulling variant which suppresses\nthe systematic signal by about 10 for a very broad range of photometric\nredshift configurations. Irrespective of the photometric redshift quality, a\nloss of statistical power is inherent to nulling, which amounts to a decrease\nof the order 50% in terms of our figure of merit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2009 14:41:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2010 11:19:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-03"}

It is generally believed that these sub-clumps merge and form a\nyoung star cluster. The time-scale of this merging process is crucial for the\nevolution and the possible survival of the final star cluster. The key issue is\nwhether this merging process happens faster than the time needed to remove the\nresidual gas of the cloud. A merging time-scale shorter than the gas-removal\ntime would enhance the survival chances of the resulting star cluster. In this\npaper we show by means of numerical simulations that the time-scale of the\nmerging is indeed very fast. Depending on the details of the initial sub-clump\ndistribution, the merging may occur before the gas is expelled from the\nnewly-formed cluster either via supernovae or the winds from massive stars.

With p+-type\nporous silicon formed on highly boron doped (100) Si single crystal, we can\nmake identical porous layers, either supported by or detached from the\nsubstrate. The pores are perpendicular to the substrate. The adsorption\nisotherms corresponding to these two layers are distinct. In the region\npreceding capillary condensation, the adsorbed amount is lower for the membrane\nthan for the supported layer and the hysteresis loop is observed at higher\npressure. We attribute this phenomenon to different elastic strains undergone\nby the two layers during the adsorption process. For the supported layer, the\nplanes perpendicular to the substrate are constrained to have the same\ninteratomic spacing as that of the substrate so that the elastic deformation is\nunilateral, at an atomic scale, and along the pore axis. When the substrate is\nremoved, tridimensional deformations occur and the porous system can find a new\nconfiguration for the solid atoms which decreases the free energy of the system\nadsorbate-solid. This results in a decrease of the adsorbed amount and in an\nincrease of the condensation pressure. The isotherms for the supported porous\nlayers shift toward that of the membrane when the layer thickness is increased\nfrom 30 to 100 microns. This is due to the relaxation of the stress exerted by\nthe substrate as a result of the breaking of Si-Si bonds at the interface\nbetween the substrate and the porous layer. The membrane is the relaxed state\nof the supported layer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2009 15:49:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

It is justified the opinion that the philosophical\nattitude the Copenhagen interpretation is based on is in principle inevitable\nfor a real comprehension of quantum theory. This attitude is mainly related to\nepistemological arguments. However, the measurement problem often seems not to\nbe treated clearly enough within the interpretation. By referring to the\nproperty of the necessity to use macroscopic measurement instruments obeying\nclassical concepts it is made the attempt to solve the measurement problem.\nAccording to this consideration the indeterministic character of quantum theory\nseems to have its origin in a lack of knowledge and thus it appears in a\nsimilar but more principle way than in statistical mechanics. It is emphasized\nthe ontological character of the uncertainty relation and the related non\nlocality of quantum theory suggesting that the existence of a position space is\nnot as fundamental as the assumptions of general quantum theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2009 15:28:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 May 2009 12:38:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2009 20:44:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-05"}

We then use the spectroscopically determined ages\nand metallicities from three samples (Trager et al 2008, Thomas et al 2005,\nGallazzi et al 2006), combined with multi-metallicity SED models, to compare\npredicted colors for galaxies with young ages (less than 8 Gyr) with the known\nCMR. We find that the CMR cannot by reproduced by the spectroscopically\ndetermined ages and metallicities in any of the samples despite the high\ninternal accuracies to the spectroscopic indices. In contrast, using only the\n$<$Fe$>$ index to determine [Fe/H], and assuming a mean age of 12 Gyr for a\ngalaxy's stellar population, we derive colors that exactly match not only the\ncolor zeropoint of the CMR but also its slope. We consider the source of young\nage estimates, the H$\\beta$ index, and examine the conflict between red\ncontinuum colors and large H$\\beta$ values in galaxy spectra. We conclude that\nour current understanding of stellar populations is insufficient to correctly\ninterpret H$\\beta$ values and that the sum of our galaxy observations supports\nan old and monolithic scenario of galaxy formation. This result has a\ndevastating impact on every study that has used the H$\\beta$ index to calculate\ngalaxy age, as the use of the H$\\beta$ versus MgFe diagram will result in\nincorrectly deduced young ages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2009 15:47:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}
